securities and exchange commission database. stock data will never be the same again. by leander kahney.", "author": "leander kahney", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp":

you're in for some serious, and tedious, digging through the securities and exchange commission edgar database of fiscal filings.but come may, investors may be able to query a souped-up version of the database that will return results in the form of a spreadsheet, or an elegant graphic.\"people are going to be able to do very highly specified searches,\" said carl malamud, one of two internet veterans behind a new as-yet-unnamed project that will support deep and complicated searches in edgar -- and other databases across the net.in the example above, a user wouldn't actually search the original sec database. rather, she would dig through the new mirror of the database, coded in extensible markup language, or xml.the duplicate database will support deep and complex searches, both within and across documents. it will also return search results in multiple formats, such as text documents or spreadsheets. it may even create on-the-fly graphics that depict the relationships between data or documents.the project, led by malamud and chief architect marshall rose, is the first step toward creating new ways to navigate databases and the internet. eventually, the company hopes to create a new class of visualization tools that will put the current generation of portals and search engines to shame.\"the challenge is to visualize the internet,\" malamud said. \"our plans are much more grandiose than just visualizing a federal government database.\"but the edgar mirror is a good step toward taking the power of xml out of the realm of the abstract and arcane, where it currently resides, and placing it in the hands of actual end users.for example, malamud said it should be possible to search all of a company's annual reports for all the tables and return them as a single spreadsheet. users will be able to save searches and perform them over again when the data is updated.rose has his credentials down solid. he created the post office protocol, or pop -- the standard protocol that swings into action every time someone checks their email.as well as pressuring the sec and the patent office to publish their filings, malamud headed up a number of nonprofit projects including internet talk radio, the first online station, and the internet 1996 world exposition.the edgar database is a good test of the team's xml prowess. it consists of about one million documents occupying 40 gb of data. the sec adds about 30 mb of new documents a day.malamud said invisible worlds, the pair's company in redwood city, california, will mark up the documents with xml and post them on its mirrored site. when the site goes live, it will be accessible through invisible worlds' web site.malamud said he hopes that other government databases will be converted to xml, allowing users to search not just across documents, but across databases.for example, people should be able to search for all of a company's patents, trademarks, financial results, and political contributions simultaneously.on the downside, edgar's new capabilities could hurt a handful of companies, like edgar online and freeedgar.com, that make a living by parsing charts and tables out of edgar's raw text.malamud has a long history of persuading government agencies to open up their databases. in 1994 he persuaded the sec to put edgar on the net in the first place.\"it will be like the edgar database when it first went online,\" he said. \"it will be fairly rudimentary but at least it will be real. it'll be a classic internet rollout.\"\"you put yourself in the public eye and you start working with your users and make it better,\" he said.steve deering, a technical leader at cisco and a member of invisible world's advisory board said invisible worlds has already built a prototype xml database out of the 2,500 \"requests for comments\" documents hosted by the internet engineering task force.deering said the company hasn't yet built the visualization tools, but he's seen mock-ups that look like traditional maps with related documents clustered into cities.the federal government is pleased with the team's work.\"it think it's terrific that companies are looking to add value to us government data,\" said tom kalil, a special advisor to president clinton. \"the world has lots of data, what we need is more insight, information, and understanding.\"\"carl malamud has been a real leader in the dissemination of us government data. he showed government agencies how a nonprofit on a shoestring budget can do this and [showed] that there's a real thirst for this kind of information.\"as more and more data goes online, finding new ways to navigate it will become increasingly important.\""}
