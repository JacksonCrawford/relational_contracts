that\u2019s called manipulating an election outcome.\"phillips said she is also worried about the potential security breeches involved with net voting. \"the internet wasn't designed to be a secure environment,\" she said. \"the net is a global environment. at this stage in the game, you can't protect against brute force attacks [from hackers]. you risk having people from all over the globe messing with our elections.\"proponents counter that internet ballots, with pre-assigned passwords and identification verification, are more secure than paper.christy adkinson, the head of marketing at votehere.net, said security and protection of voter privacy was the company's foremost consideration.\"our system is set up to verify people [are who] they say they are. a lot of polling systems today are easily fooled. you could falsely identify yourself easily and skew the vote that way,\" she said. \"the authentication process is something we really focus on.\"votehere.net requires voter signatures, uses 1024-bit encryption to protect all transmissions, and has backup servers to avoid crashes. \"we are pushing for as much security as possible,\" adkinson added. \"we ourselves can't decrypt people's votes.\"while there's no denying the potential of web voting to attract politically disinterested younger voters, many voter advocates have reservations.right now, \"people vote from the privacy of their home via absentee ballot, or from the privacy of a polling place,\" said kim alexander, founder of the california voter foundation and an advisory member of the california internet voting task force. but online elections could compromise that privacy.\"net voting will be from work, where computers are rather public.... there's a chance that people will be casually and deliberately watching how [people] vote. while the ballot is in transit someone may see it. a copy of your ballot may be retained somehow on the employee's server. there are a number of things to think about.\"online election advocates like mulholland believe that the electoral process must evolve over time.\"society has changed radically in how they do business, and elections have to catch up,\" he said. \"people are buying cars and books on the web, so why can't they use the internet to vote too?\"but alexander hopes people will think long and hard before making any sweeping changes.\"if you think about net voting for a couple minutes, it seems like a really great idea,\" she said. \"if you think about it for a few hours, it doesn't seem so great anymore.\""}
