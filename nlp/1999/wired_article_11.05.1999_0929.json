federal judge ruled friday that microsoft corp. wields monopoly power in personal computer operating systems, a major setback for the world's largest software company in one of the biggest antitrust cases of the century. in 207-pages on the facts established at trial, district judge thomas penfield jackson said microsoft's actions had done consumers harm and the company had used its power to punish competing firms.the ruling, which sets the stage for a later ruling on whether microsoft's actions broke the law, largely sided with the u.s. justice department and 19 states that brought the case against the high-technology powerhouse.if jackson finds microsoft liable for breaking the law, he could then move to apply remedies ranging from from restrictions on the way it does business to breaking up the company.the final decision may not come until well into next year unless microsoft and the government negotiate a settlement.\"three main facts indicate that microsoft enjoys monopoly power,\" jackson said, citing the company's large and stable market share, the high barriers to market entry and the lack of a commercially viable alternative to the windows operating system.\"many of these actions have harmed consumers in ways that are immediate and easily discernible,\" another part of jackson's ruling said. \"they have also caused less direct but nevertheless serious and far-reaching consumer harm by distorting competition.\"the government had charged that microsoft used its power to illegally crush rival internet browser-maker netscape and bully other firms. microsoft argued it had no monopoly in operating systems and always acted within the law.at issue in the case is whether microsoft reduced choice for consumers by illegally bullying rivals or simply competed hard in the fast-changing high-tech industry to bring new products to market.netscape was acquired by internet powerhouse america online inc. in march 1999, a deal which microsoft said repeatedly made the case irrelevant.the justice department hailed the ruling as a \"tremendous victory\" for u.s. consumers.assistant attorney general joel klein told a news conference that microsoft's abuse of monopoly power had caused \"substantial harm to consumers and innovation\" and should result in \"serious remedial redress.\"spokesman for the states who joined the action, connecticut attorney general richard blumenthal, went further than the federal government, saying that microsoft should face far-reaching sanctions.microsoft said it disagreed with many of the findings and vowed to continue to vigorously fight the case.\"we will continue to vigorously contest the issues of this case in court, but at the same time we will continue to look for ways to resolve these issues in a fair and responsible manner,\" spokesman jim cullinan told reuters.microsoft shares fell to 88-3/16 in after-hours trading friday compared with a closing price of 91-9/16 during the regular session.the following are key excerpts from findings issued by the judge:on monopoly power:\"three main facts indicate that microsoft enjoys monopoly power. first microsoft's share of intel-compatible pc operating systems is extremely large and stable. second, microsoft's dominant market share is protected by a high barrier to entry. third, and largely as a result of that barrier, microsoft's customers lack a comercially viable alternative to windows.\"on harm to consumer:\"many of these actions have harmed consumers in ways that are immediate and easily discernible. they have also caused less direct but nevertheless serious and far-reaching consumer harm by distorting competition.\"on harm to other firms:\"microsoft has demonstrated that it will use its prodigious market power and immense profits to harm any firm that insists on pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition against one of microsoft's core products.\"on battle with netscape:\"microsoft has largely succeeded in exiling (netscape's) navigator from the crucial oem (original equipment manufacturer) distribution channel.\"on microsoft's success in persuading aol to favor its explorer browser over netscape's browser:\"the aol coup which microsoft accomplished only at tremendous expense to itself and considerable deprivation of consumers' freedom of choice thus contributed to extinguishing the threat that navigator posed to application's barrier to entry.\"in order to gain aol's acceptance of these restrictions, microsoft accorded aol free desktop placement that undermined its own msn (microsoft network) in which microsoft had invested hundreds of millions of dollars.\"copyrightcopyright"}
