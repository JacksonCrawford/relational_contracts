"text": "renaissance cosmologists charted the freshly understood universe with colorful maps, embellished with gods and fanciful creatures. for today's geographers, the big challenge is to map cyberspace. just as the golden age of exploration gave rise to masterpieces of cartography, maps of the web are overflowing with creativity.a new atlas from martin dodge, a geographer at the centre for advanced spatial analysis of university college london compiles some of the most surprising, strange, and beautiful examples from this growing field.cyberspace might seem impossible to chart. after all, when william gibson coined the term, his definition was sweeping.\"cyberspace. a consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts.... a graphical representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system. unthinkable complexity. lines of light ranged in the non-space of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. like city lights, receding....\"but people are spatial creatures. \"i think the geographical dimension to understanding the growth, use, and potential of the internet is important and widely overlooked,\" said dodge, in an email interview. \"people glibly predict the 'death of distance' or the 'end of geography.' geography matters in cyberspace.\"driven by this conviction, the ph.d. student has spent much of the past four years compiling the atlas and its less graphic companion, <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"externallink\",\"outgoingurl\":\"http://www.cybergeography.org/geography_of_cyberspace.html\"}' href=\"http://www.cybergeography.org/geography_of_cyberspace.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the geography of cyberspace directory</a>.according to john stasko, professor of computer science in the graphics, visualization, and usability center at georgia tech, information visualization and maps are important for users and managers of the internet.for users, \"the holy grail has been a good visualization of a web site. right now ... to get a feeling for a site, a user must walk through it. visualization could give a feel for what's there.\" and for network managers, a visualization of traffic can help \"especially in looking for bottlenecks, where people are coming from and going, how long they spend on each page.\"dodge's maps show valiant attempts at fulfilling these needs. the most traditional maps are essentially geographic, showing, for example, the density of isps in an area, or the census of internet users in each country in africa. time-series of geographic maps show the development of the net.some of the geographic maps are comically instructive. an internet traffic map from 1995 shows two spikes of heavy traffic: new york city and what appears to be germany's georg forster outpost in antarctica. more recent maps show much higher spikes rising from innumerable nodes all around the planet. other maps show potential weaknesses of the net. maps of traffic, cable routes, and satellite downlinks combine to show just how disconnected are central asia, all of africa, and most of south america. most traffic between east asia and europe still travels through north america.another set of maps show cyberspace on its own terms -- as a collection of connections and nodes. the scales vary widely: site maps show connections within web sites, while other maps show lans or the internet as a whole. a variety of site maps and experimental 3-d browsers are shown, such as the dynamic sitemap from merzcom, a commercial product that automatically generates an elegant graphical map for any site.some of these \"information landscapes\" and \"topologies of cyberspace\" are strong on data content but weak on presentation. many rely too heavily on huge numbers of brightly colored lines. they look good on a video screen but are hard to interpret.stasko says that some \"have great visual interest, but are not so useful. people in this field sometimes lose sight of what questions are being answered.\"the both cartographically and factually excellent specimens, such as telegeography's carefully researched cable maps, are sometimes available at full resolution only for a fee.the most interesting charts are what dodge calls \"data viz stuff,\" or data visualization. one of the most surprising maps is the usenet crosspost visualization.the site can be slow and unreliable, but the charts -- when they arrive -- elegantly show the degree of crossposting between newsgroups on usenet. users can enter any newsgroup name and the server will calculate the strength of that group's connections to all other groups. in a java window, users can view an animated demonstration of data quantities and connections.it will be a while before dodge gets his biggest wish: \"i want a map of cyberspace with the beauty and functionality of the london tube map,\" he says. but such maps are on their way."}
