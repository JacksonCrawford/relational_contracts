but investors can't get past two words regarding inflation: \"upside risk.\" the nasdaq leads the market lower. by david lazarus.", "author": "david lazarus", "category": "business", "type":

impressive use of the words \"exogenous\" and \"endogeny\"). although the fedatollah had some positive things to say about the us economy, investors were unable to look past his observation that declining unemployment \"constitutes a critical upside risk to the inflation outlook.\"well, sure it does, as any econ 101 student will attest. rising labor costs can lead to higher prices for consumer goods. as to whether the fed actually sees inflation creeping into the picture, greenspan didn't say.tech stocks took it worst. the nasdaq composite index fell 62.09 points to close at 2472.36, and the wired index was 11.72 lower at 632.02. the s&p 500 was down 15.25 at 1332.06.a last-minute rally among the blue chips pushed the dow jones industrial average back from the brink after being down about 100 points. the index ultimately shed 8.59 to 10946.82.not everyone, however, took greenspan's words as a forecast of increased tornado activity. some were quick to point out that recent economic stats suggest that inflation remains nowhere to be found.\"any other interpretation doesn't jibe with the market,\" insisted arthur russell, an analyst with edward jones.indeed, the us labor department announced just prior to greenspan's speech that the number of americans filing for unemployment benefits rose last week after two straight weekly declines. a more telling indicator will be released friday when the government unveils its april jobless numbers. the unemployment rate is expected to stick at a 29-year low of 4.2 percent.besides, getting past that one little \"upside risk\" remark, the fedmeister seemed decidedly optimistic about us economic prospects. he said there's \"compelling\" evidence that increased labor productivity will be long-lasting, and was particularly enthusiastic -- if such a word can be used in describing greenspan -- about advances in information technology.the \"perceptible quickening in the pace at which technological innovations are applied,\" he said, indicates that \"the recent acceleration is not just a cyclical phenomenon or a statistical aberration, but reflects -- at least in part -- a more deep-seated, still developing, shift in our economic landscape.\"translation: tech may keep boosting the economy.microsoft (msft) certainly hopes so. the software giant slid us$1 to $78.13 after saying it will purchase a $5-billion stake in at&t following the telco's approximately $54-billion acquisition of cable operator mediaone group. the alliance sets the stage for stuffing the windows operating system into set-top cable boxes throughout the country.for its part, at&t (t) surged $4.94 to $61.88 now that it's poised to become america's largest cable company. mediaone (umg) rose $2.13 to $79, while comcast (cmcsa), which came up short in bidding for mediaone's affections, rose 6 cents to $36.69.looking ahead, edward jones' russell sees circumstances growing tougher for tech stocks. \"things typically slow down in the summer months, there's the y2k wild card, and price wars in the pc sector,\" he observed. \"the summer could be a little choppy.\"swell. as if greenspan hadn't done enough already.in ipo action, an outfit called portal software (prsf), which makes applications for online customer billing, nearly tripled to $37.38 after debuting with 4 million shares starting at $14 apiece. portal software has some high-tone clients, including uunet technologies and leading telcos. it lost more than $17 million in the latest fiscal year.lacking a solid internet pedigree, destia communications (dest), a telco, climbed a mere 13 cents to $10.13 on its first day of trading. the company arrived with 6.5 million shares initially priced at $10 each. at least destia didn't slip below its issue price, as comps.com (cdot) managed to do on wednesday.the luckless provider of online real estate data is now down another 75 cents at $13.50. investors just don't see much sex appeal in comps.com's operation, especially considering that the bulk of its revenue comes from offline services, making it only a marginal net play, the dot com in its name notwithstanding.mci worldcom (wcom) declined $5 to $84.63 amid a growing number of anonymously sourced reports that the company's weeks of negotiations to acquire wireless carrier nextel communications have come to nothing. apparently, and not surprisingly, the problem was price, with nextel wanting more per share than mci was willing to shell out. nextel (nxtl) was down 75 cents at $35.13.qwest communications international (qwst), meanwhile, jumped $4.94 to $88.69 after shareholders approved increasing the number of authorized shares to more than 2 billion from 625 million. much of this will go toward covering a two-for-one stock split taking effect later this month. qwest said the remainder will be applied to expansion of the company's high-speed network.cabletron systems (cs), a provider of computer-networking gear, rose 21 percent to $11 after saying it may sell off some of its assets. a poor man's cisco? probably not, but nevertheless worth watching.from the earnings front, software developer macromedia (macr) gained $1.63 to $38.75 after topping estimates with quarterly profit of 16 cents a share. online music store cdnow (cdnw) shed $1.69 to $16.69 as it reported a widening loss of 90 cents a share.as pc prices shrink, so too do the profit margins of retailers. compusa (cpu) fell 11 percent to $6.31 after posting a loss of 5 cents a share, in line with estimates. ceo james halpin said the company was \"clearly disappointed\" with its results, and blamed \"aggressive pricing\" for the setback.lastly, it's theme-park operator premier parks (pks) rising $1.75 to $37.38 following its $59 million purchase of mexico's biggest amusement park, as well as water attractions in houston and atlanta. premier now has almost three dozen theme parks in north america and europe.upside risk? you'll find it on the roller-coaster, where it belongs."}
