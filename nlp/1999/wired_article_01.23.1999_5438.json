they just have to go shopping.\"but our mechanical progeny must be law-abiding citizens, moravec says, and we need to address the issue immediately \u2013 before the offspring are sprung and able to do their own r&d.\"there is the possibility that these first-generation intelligent machines don't have our best interests at heart, just by accident, or they go on their own evolutionary paths and select certain kinds of behaviors that result in success for them, but maybe cause mayhem for those around them,\" moravec said. in the darwinian world of free-market capitalism, we'd want to avoid the risk of accidentally being wiped out by our own creations. moravec points out that corporations don't think first of the general public's interest, despite the trickle-down effect of the wealth they produce. that formula can only escalate when we turn corporations into nonhuman engines for moneymaking.looking for a current example, moravec wonders how to prevent a future where superhumanly manipulative companies are driven by large corporate brains. \"if r. j. reynolds is fully automated \u2013 as it eventually will be as the technology becomes available, because otherwise it won't be competitive \u2013 it better be insured that surreptitious illegal behavior isn't programmed into its goals.\"moravec calls for a framework of laws whose installation be mandatory in all corporate software. he suggests a programmed \"watchdog\" that incorporates the law and looks for violations in the larger organization \u2013 a built-in whistle-blower program, certified by an independent body.the quandary of what to do with the people who lose their jobs to machines takes on broad importance, when nearly every task imaginable is done better by machines.\"in the long run the answer is obvious: namely, people don't get paid [in money] for the work they do; they may get paid in prestige and the way other people feel about them,\" says moravec.\"but in the short run, people are not decoupled from the economy, and they actually have to work for a living,\" moravec said. more of the work, however, is intellectual and results in data, and, moravec points out, \"data wants to be free.\"trying to make money from something that is more efficiently given away becomes increasingly counter-intuitive. moravec hasn't fashioned a solution to that bug yet. but he is undaunted by setbacks and doesn't mind that change doesn't happen overnight.\"personality-wise, i'm even-keeled, and i can keep my attention on something for a very long time. i've been trying to get robots to cross rooms reliably for 30 years. and i'm not discouraged. i think we're about to succeed.\"the 50-year-old moravec has been married since 1984 and has two step-daughters. he denies that his thoughts about robots as surrogate children might be related to his own lack of biological offspring.but, he says, \"the idea, mind children, occurred to me as far back as high school, that this is just a new kind of reproduction that involves our minds and not just our old-fashioned genes. the idea of bonding with these things as if they were children \u2013 because that's what they are \u2013 seems very natural to me.\""}
