mba student, half way to a degree at one of the most prestigious business schools in the country. but lately his schooling has come from domain registrar network solutions. and he's not liking the lessons. mclanahan wanted to build a web business around the races.com domain name, and shelled out thousands of dollars to acquire it. but network solutions bungled the transfer and inadvertently put the domain name back on the available list.races.com ended up in the hands of a domain speculator who wants mclanahan to pay us$500,000 to get it back.the gist of network solution's reaction to the transfer gaffe: oops. wish we could help you. but it's out of our hands now.\"i've just been amazed by their arrogance,\" mclanahan fumes.\"this is a really unfortunate thing that happened,\" admits network solutions spokeswoman cheryl regan. \"but [mclanahan] is not a customer of ours. he was about to become one, but he didn't. there's really nothing we can do for him.\"mclanahan's off-campus foray into the biz world started cheerily enough. last spring, he drafted a business plan for entry into the mba program's business competition. the plan was, he'd launch a web site that would \"provide race information and online registration services for athletes in all sports,\" to quote from the biz plan summary.the site would include news, information, and registration forms for participation races of all sorts including running, swimming, and bike racing. the site would make money selling ads and taking a cut of the registration fees, similar to the racegate.com site that is already up and running.mclanahan liked his idea enough to go looking for the perfect web address. races.com was it, and he wanted it bad enough to shell out a handsome wad of real cash money.that was last july. mclanahan and the original races.com owner filled out all the requisite forms, and network solutions eventually commenced the transfer in september.for reasons that network solutions seemed unable to clearly explain, the company advised mclanahan there would be a five-day lag between the time it deleted the old registration info from the whois database and added the new listing. according to mclanahan, network solutions told him that the delay had something to do with his choosing to open a \"registrationplus\" or worldnic account, rather than a traditional account.during the lag time, races.com was supposed to be locked up, unavailable for anyone else to register. but it wasn't, and someone nabbed it right away. mclanahan noticed, and alerted network solutions. the company deleted the erroneous registration and started the transfer again.but again, the domain was not blocked, and again, someone else registered it. and this time, that someone else, the domain speculation company sportworld ltd registered the site through register.com, a competing whois registrar. sportworld is now advertising the sale of races.com at the domain brokerage site greatdomains.com. asking price: $500,000.network solutions couldn't just delete this new registration since it was filed by register.com. the company contacted register.com and asked them to do a favor and give it back, but register.com said no, we're under contract with the guy who registered it from us.\"they could've given it back, but they wouldn't do it,\" said network solution's regan.regan added that the technological \"vulnerability\" that allowed register.com to pluck the domain had been corrected. the gaffe occurred shortly after network solution's government-sanctioned monopoly had expired, and several \"test bed\" registrars including register.com began processing domains. the upstart registrants were testing network solutions' software that allowed shared access to its registration database.the test bed period concluded in november.after being rebuffed by register.com, a network solutions vice president called mclanahan to apologize.mclanahan wanted more than an apology. he wanted network solutions to buy the domain back from sportworld. or at least reimburse mclanahan for his payment to the original races.com owner.\"they said, 'sorry, there's nothing we can do,'\" mclanahan said.and now there's not much mclanahan can do either, according to attorneys that specialize in domain law. there have been other cases where a domain didn't make the intended route from a seller to a buyer, and network solutions has never been held liable.network solution's domain application and domain transfer forms very clearly state that the company offers no guarantees and won't be liable for registration gaffes.\"it's not clear to me that [mclanahan] has any cause of action, to be honest. he didn't have a contract with them where they've said, 'we will absolutely insure you will get the domain,'\" said connie l. ellerbach, a partner in the trademark group of fenwick & west in palo alto, california. \"so far, the courts have taken the position that nsi is not liable for anything like that.\"network solutions is basically shielded by the same legal protections as the telephone industry, added robert mcaughan, a partner at arnold white & durkee in houston.\"the [telco's] liability is basically limited to whatever the customer has paid for the services. they have broad exclusions protecting them from liability for damages resulting from wrong numbers,\" etc. same with network solutions.mclanahan doesn't want to sue the original owner of races.com to recoup his losses, and, even if he did, lawyers said he'd likely lose. the original owner fulfilled his obligations when he initiated the transfer at network solutions.without a specific contract from the original owner that said, in effect, \"i guarantee that you will receive the races.com url from me,\" mclanahan is out of luck.it's not as if mclanahan has the bucks to mount a legal assault anyway.so now it's apparently back to school, with a little cruel wisdom from the real world and lightened pockets.and it's back to the drawing board for the would-be company formerly (but never officially) known as races.com.\"losing the domain basically ruins the plan, because the name was pretty critical,\" said mclanahan. \"it was generic enough that it could be used for any sport.\"network solution's regan offers her own advice.\"my suggestion would be that he move on with alternative\" urls, she said. \"i found a bunch. racesnow.com is open, for instance.\"\"i'd rather not make a comment on that,\" said mclanahan. after further consideration he adds, \"if i have to register another domain, i'll be sure to use a competing registrar.\"and the lessons learned?\"registering domains is fraught with dangers and uncertainties that i had no idea existed.\"hmm, sounds a lot like life.editor's note: the original version of this story incorrectly stated that greatdomains.com was owned by sportworld ltd. sportworld has no ownership interest in greatdomains.com, but hired the company as an agent to broker the sale of the races.com domain. wired news regrets this error.there's no biz like e-bizthe sordid saga of sex.comthere's no biz like e-bizthe sordid saga of
