(that can) be used to directly deliver therapy to the cells, we already have a delivery system in place,\" hoffman said.\"the critical issue is how do you deliver the goods?\" venook said. \"whether it\ufffds chemotherapy, genetic immune cells, whatever, you need to penetrate the depth of the tumor for it to be effective.\"but venook questioned whether penetrating into a tumor would make a meaningful difference to a cancer patient\ufffds life.\"whether people live or die is still a function of whether the cancer spreads, and that is the question that this kind of approach doesn\ufffdt address,\" venook said. \"i have not read the primary data, but if you can find a way to get this pulsation into all the cells of the body, some of which are too small to be seen [or] inaccessible, then you\ufffdre onto something.\"the electroporation therapy system is in phase iib clinical trials in the united states and canada. researchers are testing the treatment on patients who have squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who have failed to respond to conventional therapies. in france, doctors use the technique to treat patients with head and neck cancer, metastatic liver cancer, and melanoma.hofmann said he and his research group will present additional clinical-trial results to the fda this week."}
