the good news is they're sitting on some tremendous assets ... and at the end of the day i think they'll make more money than they've ever made before, as [will] the artists.\"fans who can't get a ticket to see bruce springsteen play in their local football stadium or convention hall just might get another chance to catch him -- say, at the next microsoft or realnetwork's bash."}
