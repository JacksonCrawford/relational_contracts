\u2013 who knows how to pick the lock.it's back: after months of relative slumber \"y2k: the news story\" returned with a vengeance this week. especially plentiful were forecasts of what could go wrong, and where.the united states and britain warned its citizens of threats they might face if traveling on or around new year's. right on its heels, a canadian study said that the states themselves could be a y2k trouble spot. an administration official disputed any such notion, but a crowd of programmers that included some familiar millennial doomsayers wasn't buying what she was selling.whatever happens \u2013 assuming the internet itself doesn't topple over and your power is still on \u2013 the place to watch it all unfold will be the net. the washington-based international y2k cooperation center said it will offer an updated real-time global map on its site, outlining y2k disruptions as they happen throughout the world.gripping: handspring, which has strong ties to palm computing, unveiled a competing product called the visor. it's a handheld that can be turned into an mp3 player, mobile phone, pager, or even a heart monitor. that adaptability, and the visor's relatively modest us$179 price tag, could help expand the handheld market, observers said.palm made news, too, as 3com announced it would spin off the division and take it public. execs said splitting the company would make it easier to focus on expanding in the handheld arena, and reviving 3com's struggling networking business.good mac pr: a series of cracker attacks prompted the us army's web site to scrap its windows server in favor of one that runs on a mac. the army said the move is exploratory and could be reversed if windows nt \"proved secure.\"the future is now: it's not easy for corporate giants to adjust to a new business reality. but with the rise of the net, ibm and a few others \u2013 charles schwab, for instance \u2013 have done it, and experts said many more will follow their lead. soon. \"i see this as being the year of the traditional company getting into the internet,\" said erik brynjolfsson, a professor at mit's sloan school of management.self-amuse: the hacking group united loan gunmen doodled on gossipmonger matt drudge's site late one night. as far as anyone could tell, the sole motivation for that exercise \u2013 and a subsequent apparent attack on the nasdaq-amex site \u2013 was publicity.stuck in the study: proposed us legislation would free up a big chunk of money for yet another study on internet privacy technologies and standards, plus privacy laws and practices in other countries. oddly enough, said one expert, \"we have by now spent at least as much money studying the privacy issue as would be needed to fund an agency that would address it.\"fcc in action: the federal communications commission was busy, voting to allow upstart local telecoms to lease parts of phone networks from the big guys, like baby bells. the commission also agreed to allow mobile-phone companies to distribute handsets equipped with global positioning satellite technology that pinpoints caller locations.china confusion: without warning, the chinese minister of information industry declared foreign investment in the country's net industry illegal. china.com investors freaked, as you might expect, but many observers said that the move was more a reflection of china's complex and often contradictory internet hopes, rather than a definitive ban.overreaching: doubleclick laid claim to the \"dynamic delivery of internet advertising by a third party ad server to a network of web sites or an individual site.\" the patent sounds like it could mean windfall profits for doubleclick \u2013 except that such such broad internet patents are showing weak odds of standing up to legal scrutiny. \"just another case of the system not working,\" said one expert.read anywhere: microsoft president steve ballmer said the future of e-biz depends on companies making their information available to be reused. the way to do that? xml, a markup language designed by the world wide web consortium that provides a consistent method to describe and categorize data.gen-rsi: researchers warned that as computers become ubiquitous in the home and classroom, parents and school officials must take steps to prevent rsi in children and teenagers. this is especially important, said a cornell ergonomics prof, because \"once you develop the injury you'll always be prone to a repeated injury.\" here's how to keep 'em safe.hitting home: compaq and quantex both announced they'll bundle hardware and software that simplifies the process of sharing a net connection between home computers. just the kind of thing home networking needs to move beyond the technically inclined \u2013 which it's expected to do.tech on the road: motorola unveiled its blueprint for mobilegt, a java-based computing platform for cars that in theory can be easily tweaked to fit any model or make. it would then serve as an auto \"plug and play\" socket into which up-to-the-minute electronic gadgets, such as a net connection, gps navigation, or wireless devices, could be plugged in without the usual years of pre-planning.pc movies: sightsound.com chief scott sander said he wants his company to be \"the blockbuster of the internet.\" big dreams for a pipsqueak company, but it is set to begin renting and selling downloads of 65 full-length videos and films over the net \u2013 from a feature starring rosanna arquette to extreme-sports videos.digital police: predictable outcome at last weekend's internet content summit and munich \u2013 net guardians saw a proposed overlapping system to monitor content as \"terrifying,\" and regular folk said the web's sheer size makes ratings a necessity. in britain, meanwhile, film-industry regulators passing judgment on computer games admitted the task is fraught with peril \u2013 and that few people heed their age classifications, anyway.beating the big c: researchers found that a technique called immunohistochemistry detects proteins in breast cancer cells and is thus better able to determine whether breast cancer has spread than conventional test methods do. more work needs to be done, but the findings could lead to precise, individualized cancer treatments, rather than the standard solution of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.another from the med-tech file: a johns hopkins university team said that removing a single chemical in one gene dramatically increases aggressive behavior in male mice \u2013 and removing the same chemical in females reduces the ability of mothers to defend their offspring. don't expect any concrete therapies to come of this soon, but as one of the scientists said, \"when you get a better understanding of how a system works, it potentially gives you the ability to control it.\"your own private hollywood: the big surprise at the digital film gathering resfest was that so many of the homespun, experimental works were able to convey a sophisticated look and feel. we may have gotten to the point where anyone with a spare room can set up the equivalent of a home film studio, imagine that.just clone it: new south wales announced the formation of a special government/private trust aimed at spurring research on how the extinct tasmanian tiger might be resurrected using preserved dna. conservationists weren't keen on the idea, saying the vast sums of money it would take would be better spent on keeping alive threatened but still extant species.and that's the week that was."}
