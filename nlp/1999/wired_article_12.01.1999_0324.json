(there are an estimated eight to 10 times more dvd pcs than stand-alone players, and dvds can store as much as 4.7 to 17 gbs.)\"this is a great way to fill up the disc with additional revenue-generators,\" labarge said.he said movie studios could include screen savers or games that users would pay to use.but labarge said that the development of dvd-roms has been buggy.at one industry event in 1997 where dvd-rom publishers met with companies producing dvd-rom players, the results weren't good. \"the first time we did it, the majority of our products wouldn't work on other systems,\" labarge said.he said early 1999 tests held by intel and microsoft showed interoperability is now over 90 percent."}
