[porsche] closed it down and took the domain away,\" mcdaniel said. \"[the webmaster] was getting boxster parts to site visitors real cheap and was offering good advice for fixing the car without taking it to the dealer. porsche got mad.\"although domain-name disputes have become commonplace, the sheer number of defendants in this suit make it unique, said jan kallberg, an attorney with cyberdefense.\"[a trademark suit] done in this way is logical because if they are successful, they clean up the problem completely.\"porsche's delay is also strategic, he said. \"they have waited for precedents to be set. there are now at least 500 settled [domain-name] trademark cases. that will give them support.\"the suit was filed in us district court in the eastern district of virginia, home of domain-name registrar network solutions.it demands that network solutions present the court with the domain-name registry certificates for all 130 domains. if the domain-name holders do not appear in court to defend the legality of their domain names, the company said it will have the authority to seize the addresses. porsche said it took that tack because many of the people listed as owners of the web sites use fictitious names and addresses.the current owners of the 130 domain names in question will have the opportunity to defend their right to own the names, the company said. but if no one is present, porsche can become the new owner.mcdaniel said that although his porsches.com is one of the closest to the car manufacturer's official domain name, he has never been contacted by them.\"it is most likely because my site is 100 percent non-commercial, unlike all these other people profiting off the trademarked name,\" he said. \"i intend to keep it 100 percent non-commercial, so hopefully porsche will love my site for what it is: a tribute to them.\""}
