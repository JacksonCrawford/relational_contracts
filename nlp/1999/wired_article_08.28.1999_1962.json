opening this fall of the beecher center, dedicated to digital and electronic fine art. by reena jana.", "author": "reena jana", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "08.28.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "finally, come november, the united states will have a museum devoted solely to showcasing electronic and digital fine art. sure, art museums like the san francisco museum of modern art and the guggenheim museum have organized new media shows to complement their exhibitions of paintings and sculptures.but, unlike europe with its bastions of technology-based art like zkm and the ars electronica museum, or japan with icc, america hasn't yet housed an institution dedicated only to new media art.this week, administrators at the us$4 million beecher center for the electronic arts are settling into their new offices at the budding institution's 28,000-square-foot, four-level building.the first american new media museum is not in silicon valley. it's in the unlikely locale of youngstown, ohio.why?first of all, the beecher center has grown out of youngstown's butler institute of american art, the first museum in the united states devoted to american art. the butler was founded in 1919, and its permanent collection today includes over 10,000 works of art representing american art and aesthetics dating back to 1719, including paintings by john singer sargent and others in the art pantheon.\"the spirit for a new media museum is here, at the butler, in youngstown,\" said louis zona, who has spent the past 18 years as the director. \"this was a pioneer institution before some of the great american art museums ever opened.\"today, our contemporary art doesn't necessarily mean sculpture and painting any more. much of it has to do with the electronic age,\" zona said. \"if we were going to truly continue the mission of the butler, to show all that is great about contemporary american art, then this is a natural move.\"although the butler institute is the \"parent\" of the beecher center, the two will function as separate entities. both museums are associated with youngstown state university.state funds donated to the beecher are funneled through ysu, making the beecher a program of the university, and private donors provided additional funding. students and faculty in ysu's computer science and engineering departments will supply the technical expertise.plans for the beecher include at least four exhibitions a year. the inaugural show, which opens 7 november, will be work by video art pioneer nam june paik. zona sees holographic art, mechanical art, sound, video, and net art all as part of the mix. a \"vauditorium\", or lecture hall wired for audio and video presentations, an internet cafe, and a multimedia research library are also on the drawing board. but it's the beecher's plans for a visiting artist program that will distinguish the institution from existing museums, said zona. big-name contemporary -- and non-digital -- american artists, such as video artist bill viola and painter robert rauschenberg, will be invited to experiment with new technologies. the beecher plans to host one visiting artist a year.the model for the visiting artist program is based on that of universal limited art editions in long island, which in the past invited established painters like jasper johns and robert motherwell to try working in a medium different from their own: lithographic prints.\"the idea of bringing artists to an art museum to make art is exciting. i don't think museums think of this aspect,\" said zona. \"they think more about education and presenting. but we're looking for wonderful ideas and maybe new software to come out of this program.\"zona said he has already begun informally talking to robert rauschenberg about completing a sound piece at the beecher.\"i'll be honest with you: at first, we want prominent artists. they will help us build a reputation. but we don't want to rule out exciting young artists, either,\" said zona.the beecher center might face some stiff competition in coming years. new york's 30,000-square-foot museum 540 (formerly called the digital museum), scheduled to open in late 2000 in manhattan's chelsea art district, has a similar plan.johnson & johnson heir john s. johnson jr. and his nonprofit organization, eyebeam atelier, founded museum 540, which is funded by anonymous grants. it will present exhibitions of new media art and offer three visiting artists residencies each year.timothy druckrey, a leading new media art scholar, hopes american arts institutions that are just now embracing digital art won't ignore the international new media art community, which has existed for years.\"while it's interesting to see american art institutions tripping over themselves attempting to be pioneers in the field of digital media, their approaches so often seem more like wish-lists than well conceptualized plans,\" druckrey said via email.\"few grasp the broad history and extent of the kind of initiatives that have long been part of the media scene,\" continued druckrey, who is currently editing a series for mit press called electronic culture: history, theory, practice. the first volume, ars electronica: facing the future, will be published in september.\"this year celebrates the 20th year of ars electronica,\" druckrey said, \"and the long sustenance of other initiatives surely shows that a frontier mentality is more a naive funding strategy than a serious claim.\""}
