(the most recent book review is titled \"an apologia for stalinism.\") but there are some surprises: austin powers gets two socialist thumbs up.north said the site got its first big boost when it posted a negative review of titanic.\"everybody got sucked in by that film and we posted a very provocative story criticizing it. tons of people wrote in,\" north said.the site has started to get a bit of attention. yahoo linked to wsws kosovo coverage on nearly a daily basis. and some newspapers, including the christian science monitor and the daily telegraph have pointed readers to wsws. the toronto star even found itself recommending a wsws review of life is beautiful.of course, like any self-respecting web site, wsws is trying to take advantage of its buzz: the site has set up a secure transaction system for taking donations to the cause.no word yet on an ipo."}
