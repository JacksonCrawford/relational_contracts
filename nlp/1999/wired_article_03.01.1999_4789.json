entering late into the market for a mundane activity known as electronic filing, and extending no more than its pinkie to the legal market - swept up the business of the world's largest court and with it the potential to control the future of legal information nationwide is hardly singular. the software maker is superimposing the same plotline on 17 chosen industries, including health care, manufacturing, and real estate. even as the rest of the technology industry waits to see if government antitrust hawks can slow the company down, redmond is still busy expanding - market by market by market.most of the courts in the united states are trapped in an industrial-age hell, where weary public-sector employees toil in fields of files, producing bumper crops of headaches. one civil court division of one la district alone receives an average of 4,000 documents each day - some delivered by spandex-clad bicycle messengers, most by a sour-faced, envelope-clutching public. its 100 clerical workers must file them, but not before typing the filings into an antiquated database. then they must rifle through the equivalent of 125 million unbound copies of crime and punishment to find a case whenever someone asks for one.the scene is replicated at least 17,000 times over - the number of state trial courts in the united states. that process and archival maintenance are time-consuming and enervating, costing us courts an estimated $1 billion per year. each year, some 370 million documents are filed in us state and federal courts. even the common personal injury suit following a car accident generates reams of official paper. first you file a \"complaint\" alleging that you've suffered and the other driver is at fault, followed by a \"proof of service\" showing that you served the defendant a summons. an \"answer\" is then filed laying out the groundwork for the defense, and maybe a \"cross-complaint\" alleging that you are at fault. each filing is due by a certain date, with penalties for lateness - hence the long courthouse lines every afternoon. if the case isn't settled, both sides' attorneys will file motions to exclude certain evidence, and the court will file documents detailing the trial schedule. the minutes of the trial itself are entered into the court's file, along with the evidence - transcripts of depositions, exhibits, et cetera - and the judge's verdict. the court then becomes the keeper of the whole history and outcome of the case, available for public inquiries or as precedents for future rulings.the job of tracking a case's life cycle - its documents, filing fees, judge and jury selection, and hearing dates - is called \"case management.\"technologically speaking, it's not a herculean task to create an electronic filing system that can simplify every aspect of the court's job. documents could be filed by email or browser, authenticated and stored in unalterable digital form, and published on the net for public access. information could be siphoned directly into software that handled case management, eliminating redundant data entry. the system could collect filing fees, confirm receipt of filings, schedule hearings, and inform participants of the dates.moreover, lawyers, judges, and the public could have instant web access to any document filed, a tiny change that would speed up trial preparation, opinion writing - indeed, the very delivery of justice. \"unlocatable documents are a fact of life today that waste endless amounts of time,\" says joe kornowski, associate executive director of the los angeles county bar association. \"to be able to access a docket in a particular case directly and immediately from a lawyer's desktop would be really invaluable.\"even better, a sophisticated e-filing system could allow judges and lawyers to electronically search not just established case law, which they can do with existing databases, but the documents of live cases, instantaneously turning up specific passages without visually scanning hundreds of pages. legal precedent could be cited with a hyperlink to a prior decision. some e-filing evangelists foresee a new style of research in which a lawyer working on a case could elect to receive every relevant decision via email, with search software crawling every online court database to find it.__ with e-filing, microsoft could have avoided renting a moving truck to haul all its documents to washington. __had e-filing existed in 1995 and '96, the o. j. simpson trials would have been a whole lot easier; prosecutor marcia clark's office could have delivered deposition transcripts electronically to judge ito's clerk, and every one of the 435 criminal and 818 civil court documents that now sit in binders cluttering nearly 20 feet of downtown shelf space could have been sent and stored in digital form. more to the point: if e-filing had been in place last year, microsoft would have been spared the hassle of renting a moving truck to ship boxes of files to washington, dc, for its antitrust trial. and its attorneys could have searched with a mouse-click the 1,430 exhibits, more than a dozen deposition transcripts, direct testimonies, and over two dozen other filings the doj entered to make its case.online legal research, of course, is already commonplace. using lexis, the legal arm of lexis-nexis, which offered its first dialup service in 1973, lawyers can do keyword searches in legal libraries and in archives of state and federal case law, statutes, and regulations. lexis also offers online access to shepard's, a legal industry standard for checking the validity of case precedent (to verify a ruling hasn't been overturned, for example) that is updated daily. such services have kept attorneys out of libraries for years. but where lexis and west group, another legal publishing power, offer abstracts and summaries of cases that have already been ruled on, e-filing will add the capacity for looking up active cases - their full filing histories complete with pleadings, motions, and any other intermediary documents. e-filing would keep overburdened legal associates from having to visit courthouses or sweet-talk distant courtroom clerks into sending more recent documents, sometimes disheveled cartons full of them.perhaps the most significant change of all is that e-filing would democratize a justice system that is today controlled rigidly by attorneys, who revel in and profit from the inaccessibility of their arcane language and procedures. \"the thing that will change the legal system more than anything is that litigants will have access to information too,\" says jerry short, an e-filing entrepreneur working with microsoft. \"today litigants are left in the dark, but e-filing will let them read minutes of what happened in proceedings they weren't present in.\"it would also save taxpayers incalculable time and enormous amounts of money. a 1997 study conducted by a shawnee county, kansas, court and published by the national center for state courts found that electronic filing would save 9.63 work hours, or $218.86, for every 100 documents filed. if that la court division, with its 4,000 documents a day, experienced something similar it would save $8,754.40 a day in handling costs alone - more than $3 million a year.but the tremendous adjustment required of the buttoned-down legal industry, which holds tight to the quagmire of rules that make up its dickensian existence, means e-filing may be slow to catch on. \"it takes a cultural shift,\" says kornowski, of the la county bar. the federal courts' technical requirements for e-filing, set forth by administrators in 1997, before any e-filing systems were even in place, demand that all electronic filings be submitted in adobe's portable document format. that way e-documents would look just like paper ones, so judges and lawyers wouldn't have to learn any new tricks.for lawyers and judges to support a true change - a digitally searchable system where data location isn't even an issue - would take some doing. \"it doesn't happen overnight,\" kornowski says.__ \"today, litigants are left in the dark.\" tomorrow, e-filing will democratize the impenetrable world of attorneys. __la was ready earlier than most. back in 1994, ameritech approached the county court with an e-filing initiative. hip to the future of ecommerce, the midwestern baby bell was eager to convert its old copper wires into new data-carrying revenue streams. it figured to make a mint wiring the courts and charging lawyers for access. law firms would pay every time they filed a document or looked one up online - and yet they would pay less than they do now for the messengers they hire to perform those errands.to seed the idea, ameritech dropped about $6 million to set up a pilot program, called civiclink, in los angeles. by 1996, the telco had signed up 200 law firms and decorated the dilapidated county courthouse with four kodak imaging machines, 85 hewlett-packard workstations with 21-inch monitors, and some fancy server equipment. \"if you were dreaming an automation fantasy - all the computers, all the tech support, all the money you need - i had that,\" recalls antenorcruz, who was the court's point man on the project, with a wistful smile.but only a handful of documents were filed before ameritech pulled out. its business partners say the company demanded revenues too soon. word around la's legal community was that not enough money went into marketing. ameritech says it simply changed its ecommerce strategy. whatever the reason, it left la in the lurch, with the court and attorneys primed for e-filing, but no access to the goods.when news of the retrenchment became public, la found its e-ambitions the object of affection at several technology and legal services companies, all of which saw the city as a catapult to future profits. landing la, a court that serves 9.2 million people spread across 4,000 square miles, would lend a company instant cachet with other courts around the country. \"it sounds like a song,\" says antenorcruz, \"but if you can do it here you can do it anywhere.\" ibm, oracle, and a slew of smaller tech vendors eager to craft e-filing solutions from their software approached the court. lexis-nexis also spoke up, as did the other legal information behemoth, west group. both were eyeing e-filing as an extension of their legal databases and attorney services.it was 1996. microsoft was nowhere in sight. yet. the company had never paid much mind to legal software. with an economic model more akin to that of a hardware company - supplying the platform on which other software companies' applications run, along with some basic office applications - developing legal apps was a real stretch.but microsoft couldn't blithely dismiss an audience of 1.5 million law office and courthouse desktops. with one-quarter of the united states' large law firms each spending some $300,000 in 1997 on software and a full 57 percent dishing out more than $90,000 each for it, according to an american bar association survey, redmond's interest was piqued.even as the department of justice was building its antitrust case against the software superpower, microsoft was creating a blueprint for cracking open the legal trade - as well as other markets it had overlooked. its interest was basic. by 1996, microsoft had locked up 91.5 percent of the os market; the figure is expected to grow to 96.5 percent in 1999, according to market researcher dataquest. and the company's net income had been rising rapidly each year, growing from $1 billion in 1994 to $4.5 billion in 1998. to maintain that pace, microsoft needed new ways to grow.what was next? gates and friends knew firsthand that mega-revenues come from whole industries moving to a new platform - from paper to bytes, from microsoft's outmoded dos to windows. for people to make such changes, the software had to perform functions they couldn't live without. in earlier years, the purpose was filled by such stalwart office applications as word and excel. but these venerable apps were no longer providing the growth to achieve microsoft's goals, and increasingly, they were sharing the desktop with an army of tools tweaked to meet the specific needs of bankers, hoteliers, doctors - not all of them windows-compatible. most law firms, for example, find \"time and billing\" applications (specialized for legal accounting) indispensable. but many of those apps run on old versions of dos or on the mac, and require no system upgrade.\"so the question was: should microsoft go after these industry applications?\" recalls ms executive davide vigano. in 1995 executive vice president steve ballmer answered that big question with a modest no. the market for such applications was scattered too wide and spread too thin among professions and businesses requiring specialized tools. as vigano puts it: \"it's not possible for one company to do too many things well. so we decided to focus on the platform.\"instead of creating its own array of specialized apps and competing with third-party application developers, ballmer decreed that microsoft would partner with the specialists, and help them develop software that would run best on windows. by lending financial and technical support, microsoft could ensure that the next generation of must-have apps would run faster and smoother on windows than on anything apple or novell or sun could come up with.__ redmond created an \"opportunity map,\" targeting sectors primed for transformation. the legal community looked like rich territory. __to spearhead the effort, ballmer, who is now microsoft's president, dreamed up the application developers customer unit. by its june 1997 launch, adcu (pronounced \"ad-coo,\" like a soft sneeze) was a flush division, with a worldwide staff of 600 devoted to bringing industries that had yet to embrace the latest microsoft platform into the fold. adcu leads the microsoftian charge to invest $500 million a year in partners whose tools are optimized for nt and sql.and microsoft was willing to go a step further. the company was ready to put its marketing muscle behind this specialty software, even cobrand it, when appropriate, with the microsoft name, to subtly compel customers to run the applications on an ms os, even if they were also compatible with other operating systems. the independent software firms, naturally interested in seeing their product perform at its best and thankful for microsoft's support, would, according to adcu's strategy, become instant evangelists for the microsoft cause.one of the first things the adcu team did was to create an \"opportunity map,\" showing software usage across industries and pinpointing areas primed for technological transformation. health care and financial services were among the 17 industries targeted. (the whole list can be found at www.microsoft.com/industry/industries.htm.)the legal community was seen as rich territory. courts and law offices were heavily reliant on dos, thanks to dozens of crucial apps still dependent on it, and most networks were built on novell's netware. together, the two systems had become veritable industry standards. that made the legal industry, which had yet to move to windows, nt, or backoffice products, a wide-open target on the microsoft map.\"as we looked at the legal industry,\" says cory linton, microsoft's legal-market specialist, \"we thought, before we get them to move off dos there's going to have to be a compelling reason for them to do it. how can we get them to move?\" to answer that question, redmond hired linton's predecessor, gary cooke, an expert in electronic legal research from lexis-nexis. beginning in 1995, his job was to define the strategy that would enable microsoft to sell the legal industry more software.here was cooke's thinking:in the past, microsoft hadn't gone after many government accounts, which have long, complex sales cycles, and purchasing approval procedures that often depend on legislative budget meetings. given redmond's expertise in office applications, it seemed wiser to concentrate on the fatter side of the business: high-priced law firms that could pass the cost of electronic research on to their clients.there are twice as many desktops in law offices (1 million) as in courts (500,000). besides, microsoft had experience marketing to law firms. it had been engaged in a long, hard battle to end wordperfect's grip on attorneys. in 1994, wordperfect was the text editor of choice for 90 percent of the legal market, which had been attracted by the \"reveal codes\" that let users see where they've told the program to bold or tab or indent the text - a critical feature in a profession where improperly formatted briefs are routinely turned away by courthouse clerks. today, after years of concerted efforts to spread its word, microsoft's application is used in 32 percent of small law firms and 40 percent of large law offices, while wordperfect is used in 60 percent of both, according to an aba study.but linton, who took over the legal industry marketing manager's job in mid-1997 straight out of columbia university's business school, decided to overlook such trifles and chart a new path that would bring microsoft far richer rewards. rather than targeting either the law-firm market or the court market alone, he was looking for an app that could capture the interest of both sides, one that could bring the whole legal industry onto a modern microsoft platform. and he found it at a trade show.choice information systems, a 14-person legal software shop in newport news, virginia, had been tinkering with electronic filing for a while.mike payton, choice's president, and his partner terry hahm had met in the early 1980s while developing software for nasa, and then teamed up in the private sector to create a pc-based case management system for the courts. they called it sustain and sold it as a solution for courts to track filings and to tabulate administrative information, like the kinds of cases being heard and the number of jury trials.the company's first sale, in 1987, was to a man named jerry short, a state employee responsible for collecting and analyzing statistics from the california courts, who rapidly grew enamored with the system. he figured that if all the state's courts adopted sustain, clerks could generate with little more than the click of a button the same administrative report it took them days to tabulate.short began introducing payton and his product to various courts, including la's. then, in 1989, short left the state's employ, set up a consulting company, and created an unofficial partnership with choice, becoming the company's outside sales, marketing, and systems implementation force. with payton, the engineer, focusing on software development and the curly-headed short schmoozing the contacts he'd made during his government days, the pair sold choice to 120 courts in nine states and three countries over the last decade. short, a fast-talking marketeer, has clearly enjoyed the ride. he literally lives out of a suitcase, running his operation from cell phones and an office at the napa, california, courthouse, which has a deal with choice.the partners also started looking for opportunities beyond the creation of administrative reports, and soon focused on electronic filing. in the mid-1990s, most of their clients were still running a dos version of sustain, and, thanks in part to sustain's configuration (which was then optimized for novell), many had netware on the back end. but as the world transitioned to windows and embraced nt, choice began developing a prototype of a windows-based case management system with an e-filing component that leaned on nt.in mid-1997 choice began a successful e-filing pilot project in toronto. attorneys filed documents over a proprietary dialup network, and data was sucked into the case management and calendaring systems, while documents were published online. the system charged attorneys' bank accounts for filings and confirmed receipt of documents.that project, which was built on microsoft's nt and exchange, got the attention of cory linton in redmond. e-filing, he realized, was the kind of killer app that would simplify bureaucratic hassles for the entire legal trade, that could convince both law offices and courts to upgrade their systems and finally jettison dos for windows. already, choice's toronto pilot project was using nt without any coaxing. if learning to play court clerk seemed a stretch for redmond, well, it was already playing travel agent with its expedia web site and car salesman with carpoint.in september 1997, a colleague of cory linton's met up with choice at the national court technology conference, a mini-comdex for the legal industry, and recommended to linton that he check out the little software company. linton invited payton, hahm, and short to redmond and spelled out the company's game plan: it was interested not in developing legal software, but in helping developers like choice, who could in turn help microsoft sell more of its platform software.\"the way they explained it was - microsoft felt the legal community wasn't taking advantage of technology to the degree they wanted it to,\" recalls payton. \"they felt if the courts would provide the platform for attorneys to file electronically, lawyers would need more technology. if they needed more technology, microsoft would make more money, yadda, yadda, yadda.\"short and payton explained the demand for electronic filing and how their product would work, and microsoft saw an opportunity to go after the market. \"and then,\" says short, \"typical microsoft, they asked us how we would do it.\"__ an e-filing system adopted in california could become the de facto standard for the nation. __payton and short had already figured they would start with courts - in particular, courts like la's, which were already using choice's case management system - and sell them on the electronic filing component. law offices would come later. \"judges are never going to give up their authority and turn the rulemaking over to attorneys,\" short says. what's more, while \"private industry is going to fund what works for it, you can't take away the government's responsibility to keep records and provide access to information.\"microsoft, although still keen to partner with software firms that could make an attorney interface optimized for its platforms, liked the idea of initially building an e-filing infrastructure for the courts. the microsoft execs asked choice to come up with a list of the six courts with which the company would start.\"so we stayed up all night in the hotel room coming up with a list, and in the morning we presented it to them,\" short recalls. \"and they said, 'great.' it's like november 13th and they say, 'what do we do in december?'\"retelling the story, short lets out a booming guffaw. with a na\u00efvet\u00e9 he still finds amusing, microsoft thought it could bring those six courts into the digital age overnight. \"they don't get how the courts work, how slow government adoption cycles are,\" he says.payton wasn't sure how an alliance with microsoft would ultimately affect his business. \"a lot of tech companies have wanted to hitch their wagon to us without actually providing us anything,\" he says. \"quite frankly, we checked them out.\"he liked what he discovered. microsoft wasn't offering to make a cash investment in choice. but it was willing to partner informally with the small company to push for the widespread adoption of choice's e-filing system, and the microsoft backoffice products it was already being built on. many of microsoft's adcu partners get a potpourri of perks. the company sets milestones for its developer partners, and when the partner reaches one - when a certain percentage of the developer's sales are of products based on nt and sql server, for example - redmond opens up its goodie bag. what microsoft offered choice was essentially the clout of its sales force, plus marketing and technical help, in exchange for choice's continued development of e-filing products on the ms platform.choice really wanted a win in la, a victory that could translate into publicity and sales elsewhere. and as the software industry showed every day, whoever got into the business first was likely to become the owner of a de facto standard. microsoft knew the advantage of getting in early on e-filing and was eager to send salespeople and technical consultants to help choice win business.within weeks of their meeting, microsoft's cory linton had signed up not only choice but also two other software makers eager to enter the e-filing space: pc docs and focus systems. the idea was for choice to provide the e-filing software that would suck data out of documents filed electronically and plug it into the case management software. pc docs would integrate its document management product with choice's system, so that as they were filed with the court, documents would be seamlessly transferred into law office databases. and focus would build a front-end system for smaller law offices that didn't have extensive databases. everything would run on a microsoft platform.there was no formal partnership among the group; no contracts and no money changed hands. but like any good net age virtual corporation, the foursome immediately issued a press release detailing the combined product they could offer. they called themselves the ecourt alliance.choice had already demo'd its e-filing product to the bellwether court of los angeles county and, despite all the attention from other tech companies, antenorcruz says \"it was a no-brainer\" to go with it. the company had, after all, spent 10 years proving itself with the court's case management system. the problem was money.it was spring 1998 when antenorcruz got a grant to partially finance an e-filing pilot. since california's \"deadbeat dads\" initiative had gone through - a 1992 law that requires the state to pursue parents who haven't paid their kids' child support - la's family law court had seen its case burden skyrocket. half of the family law court's 120,000 annual filings now come from child support cases. that growth provided antenorcruz the argument he needed to persuade the state to allocate some money.the e-filing project in la's family law court was likely to cost about $2 million - far more than the $700,000 antenorcruz could wrangle from the state. so microsoft agreed to discount software, lend technical support, go for broke to get the thing running. microsoft won't say how much it forked over, but others say the company donated about $200,000 in software and unleashed a torrent of unbilled labor on the first phase of the project.it was peanuts compared with ameritech's $6 million, and it won't be enough to get the second phase of the project in gear; that will require the next round of state funding. (for now, the court's system consists of the back-end databases and case management tools that will make e-filing possible, but there's no attorney interface, and pc docs says it has done no development work on its document management piece of the puzzle.) but it has decidedly moved the la court away from its long-standing dependence on novell's netware and created a showcase for a little software provider and a software superpower.most important, la may very well be step one in establishing an e-filing standard in california. between la and napa county, where choice is getting another pilot under way, there are scores of judges, lawyers, and court administrators lobbying to have an e-filing system adopted as the state standard. and just as the high school textbooks adopted by a giant state like texas will influence education standards everywhere, so an e-filing system adopted in california could become the de facto standard for the nation. a meager investment, combined with a targeted strategy, could be all that's needed to give microsoft control of the us court filing system.\"this could give them the opportunity to lock in every single desktop,\" says burgess allison, an attorney, systems administrator, and author of <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"externallink\",\"outgoingurl\":\"http://barnesandnoble.bfast.com/booklink/click?sourceid=383472&amp;is_search=y&amp;title=the+lawyer%27s+guide+to+the+internet&amp;match=exact&amp;options=and\"}' href=\"http://barnesandnoble.bfast.com/booklink/click?sourceid=383472&amp;is_search=y&amp;title=the+lawyer%27s+guide+to+the+internet&amp;match=exact&amp;options=and\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the lawyer's guide to the internet</a> \"and to make microsoft products a prerequisite for any court or lawyer interested in filing electronically.\"\"how do we deal with the fact that it's microsoft? that's something people have addressed,\" concedes patricia tyrrell, napa's deputy county counsel. but so far, any concern that the courts might hand microsoft another monopoly is outweighed by the promise of getting e-filing up and running.of course, it's not quite that simple. unlike the os market, there's serious competition in e-filing. dozens of independent software vendors are building e-filing applications. lexis-nexis, the pioneer of online legal research, with 1.5 million subscribers, unveiled the first of its nine e-filing projects back in 1991. and the west group is tackling e-filing with a tenacity befitting a microsoft.this isn't surprising, for west is \"the microsoft of the legal publishing world,\" in the words of martin dean, an industry expert who practiced law for 32 years and runs his own legal software firm. one hundred twenty-three years old, west owns the legal publishing market - or at least the definitive record of us case law - and takes in $1.3 billion in annual revenues for providing access to it. west publishes over 75 million volumes of legal texts and 500 cd-rom libraries of case law and legal data. its key number system - a copyrighted index of us jurisprudence - has made it part of the day-to-day workings of the legal system.indeed, west's de facto monopoly on key numbering has given it a role in legal information similar to the one microsoft's operating systems have in computing. \"nobody is competing with west,\" says dean.west's model for electronic filing looks like the opposite of the ecourt plan. while ecourt was built around a customer base of courts, westfile service is built around that company's indisputably large customer base among lawyers. so, while the two models will ultimately provide the same services, west isn't getting into the business of selling the courts on new technology. instead, it will sell access to attorneys and bankroll the wiring of the courts. the cost - which steven daitch, the company's vice president of technology business development, defines vaguely as \"huge\" - is easily justified. \"it's our market,\" says daitch, who runs a 70-person technology incubator that is busy defining west's digital future.like microsoft, west partnered with a case management software developer. its partner, sct government systems (which builds its product on oracle technologies), came, like choice, with a considerable installed base. west also snagged a bang-up partnership with ibm, which will contribute its long-standing government ties and the document management software - as pc docs would in ecourt - to westfile.__ \"ecourt could give microsoft the opportunity to lock in every single desktop.\" __for west clients, e-filing would be a natural extension of their online archives - live cases, plus the convenience of desktop filing. daitch envisions a customized westfile page, displaying an attorney's cases and providing court rules and forms for the appropriate jurisdictions. ultimately westfile will probably weave in west's research and other legal services, too, to give law firms one-stop electronic shopping. e-filing could make west even more indispensable to attorneys.to get the word out, west partnered with the national center for state courts to publish the 324-page guidebook for electronic court filing. the two also held regional seminars to give policymakers a comprehensive overview of the legal, fiscal, technological, and public policy issues for e-filing - and encourage them to go for it. west seems to be positioning itself as a decisive force in setting a standard for e-filing.but microsoft is unworried by west's moves. the west-ibm-sct alliance may have more big names than the ecourt alliance, but with choice, linton says, \"we're first to get the courts up and going.\"it's not that linton perceives a lack of competition. it's just that he's determined that if west, lexis, or anyone else gets a serious e-filing campaign under way, microsoft will go tooth and nail to get a piece of the action. as per ballmer's instructions, however, it will do so not by competing, but by partnering - even partnering with west. in fact, the two companies have already talked.microsoft already has a piece of la. the superior court is converting its sustain case management system on dos to the new sustain justice edition on windows, and in the process of deploying nt where once there was novell's netware. before the court's databases are consolidated, they are considering moving to microsoft sql server from btrieve, a pc-based database once owned by novell.\"we need to move to microsoft, because that's what our consultants are asking us to do,\" says mike ewing, assistant division chief for records management at the la superior court. in his office adjacent to one of the court's mammoth filing rooms, he sits beneath an air purifier and confides that he is not necessarily thrilled about the move. \"this has been a novell shop, and we have a lot of people who understand netware well, so it's not a simple decision to change. but with novell, if we have a glitch they say to us: we don't have a patch for it, you need to work it out with your software vendor.\" microsoft, by comparison, sends its people straight over to work out the kinks. (novell appears to be doing little to stop the flow of customers to nt. \"the reality for most businesses is that it's a case of netware and nt, not netware or nt,\" is how novell spokesperson raymond nasr chooses to characterize the situation.)choice's long-term clients at the napa court are also switching from netware to windows nt, but short and payton say choice isn't requiring customers to use microsoft products. \"we don't make a dime off microsoft,\" says short. he gets perks, like a press person paid for by microsoft and microsoft sales reps to help close new accounts. but - despite the fact that choice has evinced considerable sway with the clients it's spent a decade nurturing - it has no financial arrangement, indeed no formal relationship at all, with the software kingmaker.\"i'm more interested in microsoft's technological prowess and muscle to create a standard,\" short says. \"if the largest software company in the world is behind it, maybe they can convince the courts to adopt a common platform.\"in other words, ballmer, who has called adcu one of his best decisions, was right about converting independent software developers into ms evangelists. with little money and no binding commitments, redmond is beginning to bring the legal industry onto its platform.tony antenorcruz has seen little of microsoft since the early stages of the project. cruising the la county courthouse's fluorescent-lit corridors, still crowded with clerks, messengers, and young mothers toting their toddlers through the legal maze, his voice betrays a hint of frustration: \"before, there was all the excitement, all the talk, but now we're in the trenches. this is the reality stage.\" computers are being configured and data transferred to make e-filing possible. but there is an edge of pessimism in la, a bitter twinge of fear that ecourt could go the way of ameritech - not by pulling out, but by moving like molasses.even linton, in redmond, admits it hasn't been the overnight rollout he would have liked. \"los angeles is a big, complex place, and it's taking longer than i thought,\" he says, laying blame on cultural issues for the slowness. \"it'll be another year before there's a compelling case study that shows la is saving x million dollars on this.\"but linton isn't backing down in the slightest. in the interim, microsoft will have plenty of time to tweak its approach, fine-tune its offerings, and sign on new e-filing partners.\"our objective is to get the whole industry on an electronic platform,\" he says. la is just the introduction."}
