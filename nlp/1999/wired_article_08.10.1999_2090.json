... this isn't about corporate profits; it's about denying access to a person's given name and vocation. it's digital identity theft, and it's wrong.\"a bill passed last week by the senate would make hasse's cherry-picking of names illegal.late thursday, the senate passed the anti-cybersquatting consumer protection act (s1255), sponsored by senator orrin hatch (r-utah).the bill, now on its way to the house, would stymie so-called cybersquatters -- those seeking to profit by reserving domain names that are the same as, or \"confusingly similar to,\" a trademarked word or phrase.the bill would close loopholes in trademark law by awarding statutory damages to victims of cybersquatting. of course, it's not clear how the law would affect domain names related to political candidates, whose names are not trademarked.pier said that hasse registered all of the candidates' related names well before anyone cared, and he's not concerned that people might suspect that hasse and reilly conspired to secure the names.\"there will be skeptics who will make that claim,\" but that's not the case, pier said.in another political spat over internet names, presidential hopeful george w. bush asked the federal election commission to crack down on a satirical web site in may. bush's campaign said the site was not about humor, but represents a \"political committee\" with an agenda to politically assassinate the republican candidate.the bush campaign also made a preemptive strike of its own, buying up domain names that would serve likely detractors, such as bushsucks.net, bushsucks.org, and bushblows.com.back in san francisco, pier said that the brown campaign's failure to register williebrown.com points his opponent's inability to grasp the importance of the net.\"the larger issue here is just how behind the curve not only this mayor is, but how behind the curve san francisco is. it's just clear to me that the mayor doesn't understand technology and doesn't understand the internet, doesn't understand the new medium.\""}
