competition.he aims to provide it with the collegiate professional basketball league, an eight-team league for college-age players that will pay them to play from the ages of 18 to 22 and guarantee them full college scholarships if they don't make the pros.\"if the kid is motivated by money, we've got it,\" mcmann said. \"if he's motivated by education, we can guarantee him the opportunity. if he wants to be in the nba, we'll provide him the best vehicle for that.\"the cpbl will also pay full scholarships for active players, extending scholarships up to four years after athletes age out of the league. players enrolled during the season get paid $17,000, or $3,000 more than their teammates who don't choose to enroll.to pay for his plan, mcmann, a finance professor at babson college in wellesley, massachusetts, has turned to corporate america for sponsorship.and here's the hook: for about $500,000 a year, a sponsoring company gets the right to name the team. three have already signed on.boston, meet team lycos.com; chicago, team acunet.net; and detroit, team broadcast.com. the cleveland, new york, philadelphia, washington, and new jersey teams await sponsors.\"we're not in the basketball business, we're in the advertising business,\" said mcmann.\"we've built our advertising around the basketball audience. nascar has done something similar with auto racing, and they've been phenomenally successful, translating fan loyalty to brand loyalty.\"is it marketing run amok? nope, said mcmann, though he concedes it would be if he were selling naming rights to current pro teams.\"we're not tinkering with anything in existence, we're creating something entirely new.\" besides, he said, it's a common -- and successful -- practice in europe.fortune 500 companies said they liked the idea, but didn't want to risk their brands on a team that might flop in a league that might fold.as a result, mcmann focused his marketing efforts on young dot-coms eager to establish names for themselves.\"we have something here that clearly people like and think is visionary, and we decided, 'let's take it to the visionaries.'\"he hit pay dirt.\"this is a great way to get our name out there without having to spend a lot,\" said lisa korklan, director of marketing for acunet.net, a massachusetts-based internet service provider with national ambitions. \"this puts our name in the national market.\"and the risk of having the company brand associated with the la clippers of an unknown league?\"hey, the high-tech industry is risk-taking by nature,\" said korklan.the industry also understands and embraces the idea of seed money, the stock in trade of venture capitalists. throw a little bit of money at lots of promising ideas, and one is bound to pay off big-time, said mcmann.\"of course there's a chance this won't work,\" he said, \"but if it does work, our advertisers are going to get back many, many times what they put in.\"both lycos and broadcast.com will promote the cpbl with banners on their sites, and broadcast.com will broadcast live video of every cpbl game. mcmann hopes eventually to land television contracts.still, the cpbl hasn't been an easy sell. the league's inaugural season was supposed to begin in october 1999. it's been pushed back a year. though mcmann expects to have five more sponsors lined up by the end of summer, that won't allow time enough to recruit players and hire coaches for the winter season.even with sponsors in line, the cpbl will have to struggle to recruit the sort of top-notch players that would draw fans. he's prepared to offer a few marquee payers more than $17k to get the ball rolling.theoretically, the cpbl could operate as a sort of minor league for top high-school prospects too green to head straight to the pros. but it remains to be seen whether the nba will throw its support to the new college league.\"we really haven't issued any opinion on it,\" said evan silverman, a spokesman for the nba.still, if mcmann can get the ball rolling, nba scouts will be watching. \"our scouts will look anywhere,\" said silverman. \"it there's someone that they believe can play in the nba, they'll check it out.\"the cpbl will actually compete for fans with the nba in most of its markets, but mcmann thinks there's room for both leagues.\"the nba is the mercedes of basketball -- nice but pricey. we aim to offer quality at a lower price. you know, ford sells a lot of tauruses. we think we can be the ford taurus of basketball.\""}
