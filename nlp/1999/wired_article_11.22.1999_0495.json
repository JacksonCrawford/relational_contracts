the marriage of competitors was doomed from day one.", "author": "reuters", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "11.22.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "computer maker sgi is in talks to sell cray research -- once one of the technological gems of the united states -- to a little-known technology acquisition group called gores technology group, industry sources said. one industry source said that the companies have been talking for at least two months and that gores -- with operations in los angeles and boulder, colorado -- originally offered us$100 million for the struggling supercomputer maker. but since doing due diligence on cray, it has lowered its offer, the source said.steve conway, a spokesman for cray, a business unit of sgi, in eagan, minnesota, declined to comment on who cray is talking to, but he did say that the current merger talks are accelerating.\"beyond just saying the talks are far along, i can't really comment,\" conway said. dan gray, who works in business development at gores technology, also said he cannot comment.sgi, based in mountain view, california, announced in august that it had formed a separate business unit for cray, amid yet another restructuring at sgi and job cuts of 1,500. at the time, sgi said it was in active discussions with other companies to assume the operation of cray through a partnership or another transaction.another source said that cray and gores were hoping to make an announcement at last week's supercomputing '99 conference in portland, oregon, which was a launching pad for a newly independent cray, but the talks were still ongoing at the time of the show.three and a half years ago, sgi paid over $700 million for cray, which was once the largest maker of supercomputers, the world's fastest computers. at the time of the deal, cray had about 4,500 employees, and about $900 million in revenues, but it was struggling to grow, amid declining us research and defense budgets, the biggest customers of the supercomputers cray makes.cray research was founded in 1972 by supercomputing legend seymour cray, to develop the world's fastest general purpose supercomputers. its so-called vector systems use a few processors for computing scientific grand challenges such as simulations of atomic explosions, weather forecasting, pharmaceutical design and other problems which require massive amounts of calculation.but its multimillion dollar machines were hurt at the low end of the market by lower-cost massively parallel systems, running multiple off-the-shelf processors in parallel. cray entered the market for massively parallel machines several years ago, and now also develops the t3e, the follow-on to its first massively parallel machine, the cray t3d, launched in 1993.cray has also been hurt by what some say was a disastrous merger with sgi. sgi had been so competitive with cray for so many years that the company was incapable of dealing with cray once it become a partner, one industry source said.\"it was like if your sister married your worst enemy ... and all of a sudden he was a member of the family,\" the source said.\"we are a lot more focused now,\" said steve oberlin, vice president and general manager of sgi's cray research unit, in a recent interview. he said the merger was the right thing for cray to do at the time. \"cray was trying to offer multiple product lines.... today, we are tightly focused on one product line.... as in any merger, there has been some rough spots.\"when asked about the company's deal talks, oberlin, who was the chief architect of the cray t3d, said cray was talking to one company in particular and that \"weeks, rather than months is the goal,\" for doing a deal, but he declined to be more specific.now cray expects to have about 850 employees and $300 million in revenues, as a stand-alone company this year. it is also working on the successor to its current sv1 vector machine, called the sv2, which is due in mid 2002. the sv2 is a hybrid of cray's vector technology with thousands of processors.in september, the national security agency and other us government agencies announced that they would be providing financial support for the development of cray's sv2.analysts said the purchase of cray is of key importance to the us and strategic to its national security.\"they are a national asset and there is a demand for this technology,\" said debra goldfarb, an analyst at international data corp. in framingham, mass. \"it is strategic to our national defense and our economic security.... today, you can't solve all problems with mainstream technology.\"goldfarb also said that there are some companies, such as automobile manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and chemical companies, in addition to the us national laboratories, which rely on their cray supercomputers to conduct research.gores technology to date has done about 10 technology acquisitions, including one deal in the supercomputing arena. it purchased thinking machines, the originator of the massively parallel computer, but which eventually succumbed to the big computer companies like international business machines corp. and silicon graphics (sgi), who jumped into the market. it is now called connection machines services.\"we acquire any and all types of technologies,\" gray said. \"it's typically been fortune 500 divestitures.\"analysts and industry sources predict that if cray is purchased by gores or another company, it will continue to operate as a going concern.`\"cray is not going to disappear,\" said richard partridge. an analyst at d.h. brown associates. \"they do have some unique designs that will continue to satisfy certain areas.... it's an important niche, but it is a niche.\"copyright"}
