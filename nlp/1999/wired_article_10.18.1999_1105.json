an underground bunker, making sure any y2k snafus don't accidentally trigger world war iii.", "author": "reuters", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "10.18.1999 12:40 PM", "text": "deadly nuclear foes from another era plan to ring in the new year together to make sure the world survives the 2000 technology bogeyman known as y2k. russian and us military personnel will sit side by side inside us space command's building 1840 at peterson air force base in colorado to mount a pioneering missile watch aimed at heading off the worst y2k danger of all, an accidental atomic armageddon.the project -- the center for year 2000 strategic stability -- was devised by the pentagon, which worries that y2k glitches may blind moscow's missile-launch detection system or cause false alarms -- and possibly trigger a nuclear holocaust.were there to be a diplomatic crisis at the same time, \"the potential for russia to misinterpret early warning data\" would be extra worrisome, the top cia officer for science and technology told congress last week.with 2,000 nuclear-tipped russian missiles still on launch-within-minutes alert -- along with 2,440 us missiles -- defence secretary william cohen has described the y2k center as a kind of hand-holding exercise to prevent any surprises.it will cut the chance \"that a turn-of-the-millennium computer error will create an end-of-the-year security incident,\" cohen in september, when he and his russian counterpart, igor sergeyev, signed an agreement in moscow establishing the center.the arrangement will let the cold war enemies do something that was unimaginable just a decade ago -- sit together and double-check us-provided sensitive early-warning data about possible ballistic missile launches.the operation is a prototype for a permanent us-russian early-warning center that president clinton and russian president boris yeltsin agreed last year to set up in moscow.along with the perceived y2k vulnerabilities of russia's strategic warning system, the command control of its military is at risk during the calendar rollover, the cia's lawrence gershwin told a special senate y2k committee in october.unlike cash-strapped russia, the pentagon is spending us$3.8 billion to prepare its most important systems for 1 january 2000.beginning 27 december, in a windowless, cubicle space that's been converted into the y2k center, americans and russians will share modular work stations following a week-long warmup.working in shifts, the 20 or so russians and their american teammates will keep a round-the-clock vigil until a date to be determined in mid-january, according to air force lt. col. jon wicklund of the space command, the center's operator.launch data will be displayed as it is picked up by nearby cheyenne mountain, the fabled, steel-sheathed operations center of the north american aerospace defense command (norad) on the outskirts of colorado springs.norad, a joint us-canadian command, uses a global mesh of satellites, radars, and sensors to detect missile and space shots. us satellites can pick up the heat of a scud missile launch from 22,300 miles (35,887 km) in space.norad has left no stone unturned to ensure its own y2k readiness and has contingency plans \"to cover a failure if it occurred,\" said canadian major gen. david bartram, chief of operations.from norad, the russians will get a stripped-down data stream on any launch to veil us intelligence sources and methods.\"we're not interested in showing them all the capabilities that we've got,\" said col. robert ryals, the vice commander of the air force's space warfare center, who may be the top-ranking member of the american team.details of the center's operations were worked out last month during a russian team's stay at peterson air force base. an american delegation will visit moscow this week to fine-tune the arrangements. by agreement, seven chunks of data will be shared on any launch over 310 miles (500 kilometers): point of origin, time, number of missiles detected, trajectories, types launched, projected target area, and projected impact time.anything at odds with what moscow detects could be discussed on a y2k-tested \"hot line.\" another such line goes to cheyenne mountain's command center, where norad can quickly bump a problem up its abbreviated chain of command to washington.the y2k center also will provide a link for any other defense-related problems that emerge during the y2k crossover, such as aircraft that may go off course, us nuclear planners said.sitting with the russians will \"provide additional safeguards appropriate to this period of heightened uncertainty,\" edward warner, assistant secretary of defense for strategy and threat reduction, told congress last month.us officials say they are highly confident that y2k failures will not lead to the inadvertent or unauthorized launch of a ballistic missile by any country. but widespread system failures could spur \"opportunistic engagements\" by hostile forces, the pentagon's joint staff warned us commanders in a september memo.so far, no missile or space launches are known to be scheduled during the y2k rollover, according to air force lt. col. randy blaisdell, the center's program manager.worldwide, said bartram, one ballistic missile test launch or space shot is detected about once every 36 hours, with \"very, very few\" of them surprises.copyright"}
