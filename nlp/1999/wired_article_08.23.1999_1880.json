closed-circuit tv, even campuses out in the boonies can feel connected. by kristen philipkoski.", "author": "kristen philipkoski", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "08.23.1999

learning and connect students with a wider world. \"technology is a little more important here because it's empowering for the kids and the staff. it opens up an avenue to media and communication that just [isn't] there to other kids who may be in a rural location,\" said morgan toal, wide area network manager of the copper river school district, in southwestern alaska.wired news goes back to school- - - - - -the district -- which has eight schools covering an area the size of ohio but only about 150 students -- has its own server, and a web site connecting all the schools in the district. kids can access schedules, homework assignments, and save their own files in a digital locker for retrieval from any internet browser.\"i think it helps out a lot. we have internet access, so you can research all kinds of things -- math projects and science and all kinds of stuff,\" said robert stumpf, who starts his freshman year in copper river on monday. \"we have our own personal folders on the servers so we can access them from everywhere instead of carrying around floppy disks and losing them.\"the alaska district also has a video-conferencing system that last year allowed two students to take classes remotely. otherwise, they would have faced an hourlong commute every day to school.copper river is lucky enough to have a bigwig from internet alaska living in the area, according to toale, or so the rumor goes. the anonymous vip is said to have had land lines installed in the area, enabling speedy t1 connections at local schools.not all rural schools have such a benefactor. melvin, iowa, has computers with internet access in most of its classrooms, but many students can't get online at home.\"a small community like melvin doesn't have enough people there for the people in that community to have toll-free access at home. we don't compare in that way to other cities,\" said david vander broek, technology director for the hartley-melvin-sanborn school district.while the internet use has helped some rural areas feel connected, some teachers think the web can be an unnecessary distraction.\"i don't see any need for the internet in most classes,\" said george jones, principal of millville high school in eastern pennsylvania. the school has about 400 students and one computer for approximately every 20 students, all with web access. \"if you're doing math, there's no need for the internet. occasionally something could come up that you'll need, but that can be accomplished by going to the library and using some basics.\"in palo alto, california, one of the most tech-savvy school districts in the country, an official digital high school boasts high-speed t1 connections, computers in most classrooms, its own server -- the whole shebang.ed faulkner, technology coordinator for the palo alto school district, said he's begun a program he predicts will be the wave of the future in school computer equipment: the thin client. faulkner will be rolling out a 30-unit lab of the stand-alone computers when school starts in two weeks. the units are stripped-down terminals that cost only about us$500 each, and can boot from one server in the district office.a new interface has made thin clients more user friendly than previous configurations, faulkner said. eventually, he hopes to put thin clients all over the district so all of the schools can be connected.\"this thin client product will allow us to populate classrooms with several of these, and they're full-powered but they're very inexpensive,\" faulkner said.\"they give the teachers maximum flexibilty -- it frees them up to go about the business of teaching instead of managing technology. at the same time it gives them maximum control. it's the best of both worlds,\" faulkner said.mirror lake middle school near anchorage is producing its own news broadcasts three times a week.technology facilitator emily blahouse established a partnership with a local tv station to learn how to use the school's video production equipment, and get advice on some of the subtleties of newscasting, like camera angles and wardrobe.the student production team uses two digital cameras for different angles, computer monitors for teleprompters, and background music composed by one of the students. a closed circuit television system allows the news to be broadcast to all of the school's classrooms simultaneously.\"we insert clips of anything happening around the school: sports, music, poetry, meetings, black history month, whatever,\" said blahouse. \"we incorporate anything anyone wants. they just make arrangements and we'll splice it in.\"at cabrillo middle school in ventura, california, the students are planning a virtual yearbook this year, according to student body secretary jose lopez.they're still in the process of setting up a web-based network using a service called the trellix system, and when it's finished, the students will be able to look at their class photos from any computer with web access.studies show the money spent on technology in schools isn't going to waste, according to the milken exchange on education technology.one study, which compiled the results from more than 500 different research projects, found that students who used computer-based instruction scored at the 64th percentile of achievement, on average, while those without computers scored in the 50th percentile. the same study found that computer-based instruction helped students learn more in less time and that students enjoyed their classes more.the anytime anywhere learning project sponsored by toshiba and microsoft provided laptops to students in several school districts. a follow-up study found, not surprisingly, that the kids who had laptops were more proficient with computers and software than those without.the study also found that for tasks other than writing -- including taking notes and solving math problems -- students were much more likely to use old-fashioned paper and pencil even if they had a laptop handy.faulkner, of palo alto, maintains that technology shouldn't be used just because it's available.\"we're trying to get national recognition, but not for the sake of national recognition,\" he said. \"the bottom line is, we're not in the business of technology, we're here to instruct students. if it doesn't help students, then forget it.\""}
