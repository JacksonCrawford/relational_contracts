number of \"greenies\" are trying to change things from the inside ... with varying results. by chris gaither.", "author": "chris gaither", "category": "science", "type": "article", "timestamp":

jimison never thought about going to work for the high-tech companies that were causing some of the messes.but when quantum corp., which sells hard drives and tape drives to the world's biggest computer companies, called two years ago, jimison saw her chance to infiltrate.\"i got tired of cleaning up past problems and wanted to start cleaning up future problems,\" said jimison, a program manager in the company's worldwide environmental stewardship division.she is one of an increasing number of greenies going to work for large corporations with dreams of changing them from the inside. these environmental experts try to balance the earth's health with the company's bottom-line.environmental regulations taking shape in europe (and corporate conscience, to a lesser extent) are slowly changing the way high-tech corporations do business. companies are asking more questions about their suppliers' environmental practices in an effort to avoid getting caught with green blood on their hands.\"there's a reason why there's such a push being made,\" said h. scott matthews, assistant head of the department of engineering and public policy at carnegie mellon university. \"[environmental experts] are not being hired because firms want tree-hugging people working on it. there are definite business reasons behind it.\"quantum manufactures very few of its products, focusing instead on the packaging and marketing of computer drives made by subcontractors. jimison's environmental team works with designers to create energy-efficient, recyclable products.and for the first time, quantum will soon include environmental compliance in its general review of a supplier's performance, following a policy practiced by such corporations as hewlett-packard.at the top of the supply chain, hp actively presses its subcontractors to follow its standards, said karl tiefert, an environmental project manager. hp environmentalists visit subcontractors' factories and rate environmental performance.tiefert's team analyzes the environmental impact of a product through development, production, use, and disposal. \"a manufacturer has significant responsibility throughout a life cycle of a product,\" he said.but at both quantum and hewlett packard, environmental rating is only one factor, tucked in with the almighty factors: cost, quality, and delivery time. in a straight-up battle with price and market share, matthews said, an environmentalist's recommendation will lose just about every time.\"they have to identify a win-win situation,\" he said. \"you have to pick your battles.\"one battle jimison hasn't taken on is the removal of lead solder from quantum's computer drives. in landfills, lead can seep into groundwater, but the tech industry offers no affordable alternatives.\"the customer rules,\" jimison said. \"we could have our products sent out in organic cotton packaging, but nobody would pay for that.\"the globalization of the supply chain also challenges environmentalists. the semiconductor industry saves money by using subcontractors in such countries as indonesia, china, and malaysia, where low wages and minimal environmental regulations keep production costs down.\"parts of the computer sitting on my desk were made all over the world,\" said ted smith, executive director of the silicon valley toxics coalition, a watchdog group founded in 1982.\"even when you're dealing with people with the best intentions ... it's still enormously difficult because the supply chain is so spread out.\"industry giants ibm and national semiconductor are facing three class-action lawsuits from more than 150 current and former employees.the suits allege that years of exposure to toxic chemicals, including solvents, caused cancer and birth defects -- a claim the industry staunchly denies.june andersen, ibm's environmental steward, agreed to an interview with wired news, but the corporate communications department canceled the session.smith's wife, attorney amanda hawes, is leading the two suits against ibm. smith said corporate environmentalists have generally made \"tremendous improvement over the years,\" but he still worries that profit concerns win out over environmental concerns, especially when industry lobbyists struggle to suppress green laws.\"people like june or karl or elizabeth are doing what they can on the ground, but you have all these forces out there working against them, and their voices aren't being heard,\" he said."}
