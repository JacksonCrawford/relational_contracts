[limits] may be useful for controlling your citizens, but it is not useful for fighting crime.\"germany has decided to take a more open approach, and wants to make sure the world knows.\"if we want to guarantee more security and confidence in the internet, new encryption systems will be required,\" schily said. \"the [german] government has reformulated its position toward the encryption of electronic data in the private and business sectors.... the government does not intend to limit the free availability of encryption products in germany.\"later, schily was presented with a list of recommendations for \"self-regulation\" of internet content that were put together by the bertelsmann foundation, sponsor of the weekend conference. these included the controversial idea of ratings.but schily's remarks made it clear that much more is at stake than a standoff between opponents and proponents of internet ratings.reaction to schily's strong statement on encryption was immediate. ira magaziner, former white house high-tech guru, wasted no time in supporting the interior minister.\"personally, i agree with that position,\" magaziner said. \"i understand the concerns of law enforcement, but personally, i think it's important to have high-level encryption available to people.\"the clear statement on encryption shows the mounting importance of transatlantic links in the development of internet policy and theory. the europeans appear to be much more comfortable than many americans are with some kind of government role in regulating internet content.\"the old continent, europe, which is still lagging behind the avant-garde-ish united states, is catching up a little,\" said siegmar mosdorf, parliamentary secretary to the federal ministry of commerce and technology, citing the german parliament's new policy on encryption technology.but while schily talked about the need for some form of government involvement in efforts to regulate internet conduct, mosdorf took on the question in a much broader context.\"we still harbor the erroneous belief that 'information society' means reformed society,\" he said.\"in looking to the 21st century, we need not only competent media, we need a renaissance of classical education, so we have people who can evaluate information. this is a big opportunity for europe, given our history.\"the idea of europe catching up to the information-age revolution -- and even having something to offer its american cousins -- is trendy these days. but greater worldwide involvement in defining the medium was always what the web was supposed to be about, magaziner said.\"if you want to control the internet -- and i don't think it's a good idea -- you can't,\" he said. \"you can't keep the internet out of your country unless you shoot down every satellite and confiscate every television and computer.\""}
