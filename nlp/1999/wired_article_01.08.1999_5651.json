(\"throw away your &*@$&@ microsoft word!\" the invite read.)unlike other computer industry functions, there wasn't a gap-clad marketeer in sight. these were the true geeks, still living proudly on the operating system fringe.the evening's hosts were omnicircus, a group of local artists who build robotic sculpture in their machine shop-turned-theater, then turn them loose on a sometimes-unsuspecting public.during the meet-and-greet, a robot in a wheelchair cruised the floor of the tiny warehouse, screeching, \"i'm just like you! give me my 50 cents!\"the undisputed climax of the evening was a performance called \"one-legged men at a butt-kicking contest,\" in which two, well ... two one-legged robot men kicked each other's butts.the robots and their performances are the work of frank garvey, jeff weber, carl pisaturo, and aaron edsinger, four san francisco artists whose general mission in life seems to be to \"generate controversy like beer makes urine,\" according to the omnicircus web site. garvey founded the project in 1988.an almost unnoticed performance showed the subtle, beautiful side of the robotic works: a 20-inch high robot on a pedestal who dreamily conducted classical music for an invisible orchestra.but no small talk was too geeky for this event. a favorite topic of conversation concerned a joke email circulating the internet about bill gates deciding to trademark ones and zeroes.one guy described his ideal geekware: a t-shirt with the linux penguin emblazoned on it. \"you could wear it to raves and everyone would be like, 'cool,' but all the geeks would get it,\" he said enthusiastically.ah, macworld, we hardly knew ye."}
