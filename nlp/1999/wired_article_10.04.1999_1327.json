dates and fresh spring water from deep beneath the desert. in front of the building is an unpaved road where children are playing. fifty miles away is the algerian border. inside, on the edge of the sahara in tozeur, tunisia, is \"publinet,\" tunisia's answer to the cybercaf\u00e9.a month ago, this branch of publinet was opened by two sisters from tozeur, abrei and racemolhe bribek. publinet is essentially a store where people can surf the net for an hourly fee. and the owners, one of whom was looking at a career as a secretary before publinet came along, love their work.\"what we do with the internet does not seem like work,\" abrei, 24, says.publinet and other government programs are spearheading the introduction of the internet in tunisia, where private isps were only authorized in 1997.but the internet has also been as much a sticky challenge as an opportunity for this authoritarian government. the struggle over freedom of information has already injured this north african country's image as a so-called internet oasis.the bribek sisters took advantage of a program through which their government finances 100 percent of the startup costs, and then requires the repayment of only 50 percent of the loan.because tunisia's caf\u00e9 culture is overwhelmingly male-dominated, the tunisian government -- a pioneer of women's rights -- insists that each publinet center be separate from caf\u00e9s. publinet is only one of the programs which the tunisian government has set in motion to bring this small north african country into the internet age.the tunisian internet agency was established in 1996 to register domain names, conduct seminars on internet technology, and set up additional networks to bring more tunisians online.and tunisian authorities are also getting schoolchildren hooked on the internet. the arabic-language daily al-horria says that by the end of this year, almost 40 percent of all tunisian schools will be plugged into the internet. computer courses are to become a standard part of the curriculum.lest any tunisians escape the reach of the programs introduced in these areas, there is also the \"internet caravan,\" with its mission to introduce cyberspace to young people living in remote areas.but if the internet has captured the imagination of many ordinary tunisians -- one never hears a negative word about it in the country -- the tunisian government has had less success with the outside world.whatever the country's merits (tunisia rightly claims itself a pioneer in women's rights and family planning) it has also been a de facto dictatorship since president ben ali took power in a bloodless coup in 1987. his power today extends to the internet.earlier this year, amnesty international had a high-profile spat with a public relations agency closely affiliated with the tunisian government.amnesty has long been critical of the tunisia's human rights record, claiming the government has tortured activists and denied due process to political prisoners. but that didn't stop raghib el chammah, who heads a public relations agency with offices in paris and beirut, from setting up a site full of praise for tunisia's record on human rights.el chammah claims he came to tunisia's defense independently, but according to the paris-based organization reporters without borders one of his biggest clients is the tunisian government.amnesty retaliated with its own special site on tunisia and will continue to speak its mind, according to its headquarters in britain.but that does tunisians no good whatsoever, even if they have access to the internet. the amnesty site is blocked inside tunisia.the gateway that the internet offers to information that does not come from the tunisian government is firmly under the control of ... the tunisian government.there are only two private isps in tunisia, according to the tunisian internet agency. but one, planet, is controlled by the daughter of president ben ali. the other, global net, is run by a close associate of ben ali's family, according to reporters without borders.neither company returned emails seeking comment about their ownership. promotion on one hand, restrictions on the other -- that is the tunisian way.but with thousands of tunisians learning to make the internet part of their lives, the government has headed irrevocably down a one-way street. says one observer: \"tunisia is embracing what it cannot control.\""}
