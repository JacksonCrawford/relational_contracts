9500 for good measure. impeachment trial? what impeachment trial? by david lazarus.", "author": "david lazarus", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "01.06.1999 02:00 PM", "text": "wall street roared to record highs wednesday, fueled by ongoing merger activity, a windfall of ready cash, and the sort of irrational exuberance that gives a certain fed chief the willies. tech and internet stocks led the way amid continued enthusiasm for electronic retailing and commerce.the dow jones industrial average gained 233.78 points to 9544.97, blowing past both the 9400 and 9500 marks for the first time ever, and the s&p 500 was 27.57 higher at 1272.35. the nasdaq composite index gained 69.36 to 2320.62, and the wired index was up 23.74 at 613.92. these were all record-high closes.\"the fourth quarter was one of the best fourth quarters of the entire decade,\" said alexander paris sr., an analyst with barrington research. \"also, there is traditionally a strong push in the market at this time of year.\"he cited a fresh supply of liquid funds now spilling into equities from 401k and pension plans. moreover, low inflation is deterring people from investing in real estate, gold, and other such alternatives, making stocks \"the only game in town,\" paris said.one small reality check: oklahoma-based phillips petroleum (p) cast some drizzle on the parade by announcing it will hand pink slips to about 1,400 workers and report a quarterly loss as a result of us$339 million in charges. while this doesn't send the most encouraging signal about long-term economic vitality, it came as welcome news to investors, who pushed phillips' stock up $1.19 to $43.81.oh, and the president's impeachment trial starts thursday. like anyone cares.meanwhile, back in the parallel universe occupied by internet shares, service provider mindspring enterprises (mspg) jumped $8.94, or 13 percent, to $75.50 as it shelled out about $245 million for icg communications' netcom subsidiary. icg (icgx), which will retain netcom's backbone network, shed 19 cents to $22.94.icg purchased netcom for $285 million exactly a year ago to get its hands on the isp's high-speed backbone. since then, netcom subscribers found the service increasingly unreliable as the system struggled to keep pace with new area codes and demand for higher-speed access. rumors of netcom's sale have been floating around for months.industry leader america online (aol) climbed $1.94 to $148.88 as lehman brothers analyst brian oakes urged clients to hang on to all their shares in the company. \"even with the dramatic run-up in aol's stock, we believe it could be a mistake to sell one share, given the potential catalysts we see over the next six months,\" he said.one such catalyst is the prospect for continued consolidation among top net outfits. lycos (lcos), soon-to-be parent of wired news, has been the object of much speculation lately that an acquisition is in the cards. its shares gained $13.88, or 26 percent, to $66.25 as cs first boston initiated coverage of the company with a \"buy\" rating.earthlink network (elnk) rose $3.31 to $68.94 as sprint (fon) said it would maintain its 27-percent stake in the isp by purchasing additional shares. earthlink filed last month to boost its number of outstanding shares by 2.5 million. sprint was unchanged at $81.94.amazon.com (amzn) vaulted $13.38, or 11 percent, to $137.88, and yahoo (yhoo) was up $33.13, or 13 percent, at $291. even ebay (ebay), which has no business doing this well, accelerated $59, or 26 percent, to $283.in tech, apple computer (aapl) slipped $1.56 to $41.75 as cibc oppenheimer downgraded its rating for the company's stock to \"underperform\" from \"hold.\" this follows a stream of positive news from the macworld expo in san francisco, where not-quite-ceo steve jobs unveiled five new colors for the popular imac and said apple is on course to post its fifth quarterly profit in a row.high hopes for the chip industry pushed intel (intc) $6.25 higher to $129.50, and applied materials (amat) surged $3.81 to $53.56. dell computer (dell) advanced $2.88 to $78.13, and microsoft (msft) was up $4.75 at $151.25.barrington's paris thinks tech stocks will continue setting the pace for the market's rally because these are the companies showing the highest growth in terms of unit sales. with growth in us corporate profits slowing, he said investors will increasingly look instead at overall revenues and total shipments as a gauge of performance.airtouch communications (ati), america's biggest wireless phone service, rose $2.44 to $79.94 on reports that vodafone group (vod) has increased its bid for the company to $55 billion, crushing a rival $45 billion offer from bell atlantic (bel). vodafone's offer is believed to be worth more than $90 a share. the company's stock rose $1.63 to $180.75, while bell was up $1.69 at $56.25.despite a denial from nissan motor that it's in talks with anyone about a buyout of the troubled automaker, daimlerchrysler (dcx) gained another $1.88 to $108 on speculation that it is indeed negotiating a deal. japanese companies routinely issue denials of such doings, as opposed to the western habit of not commenting on rumors.lastly, disney (dis) advanced 38 cents to $30.94 even as salomon smith barney lowered its first-quarter earnings forecast for the company to 22 cents a share from 25 cents. sagging profits are taking a toll as well on ceo michael eisner, who saw his annual bonus slashed to a miserly $5 million, compared to the nearly $10 million he received a year ago.kind of makes you wonder how the poor guy is going to get by."}
