another net-related company went through the roof on its first day of trading. allaire (allr), a maker of software for web-site development, more than doubled to $43.75 after its 2.5 million shares debuted at $20 each. the day traders were all over this puppy, no doubt relieved to have something new to throw back and forth after some pretty downcast sessions.further consolidation among satellite broadcasters: hughes electronics' directv is purchasing its closest competitor, primestar, for about $1.8 billion. the deal will give directv increased channel capacity plus 2.3 million new customers, and follows directv's earlier acquisition of us satellite broadcasting for approximately $1.3 billion. hughes (gmh), a unit of general motors, was $1.94 higher at $46.69.sun microsystems (sunw) slipped 25 cents to $98 even as it reported quarterly profit of 67 cents a share, excluding charges for acquisitions. this topped the anticipated amount by a penny. gateway (gtw), meanwhile, rose $4.50 to $62.50 after posting income of 81 cents a share. analysts had been expecting the computer maker to come through with 78 cents.bmc software (bmcs) climbed 14 percent to $43.94 after reporting quarterly profit of 44 cents a share, topping expectations by a nickel. meantime, electronic arts (erts), the leading maker of videogames, was up $1.25 at $47.75 as it logged better-than-anticipated earnings of $1.15 a share.the trouble in brazil took a toll on daimlerchrysler (dcx), which does a lot of business in the country. its stock shed $1.69 to $103.94. separately, rumors are flying that daimlerchrysler is about to announce some sort of tie-up with ailing nissan motor. don't be surprised if daimlerchrysler buys about a third of the japanese automaker.lastly, denmark's lego group said it expects to report its first loss in nearly 60 years. for some reason, kids these days are more interested in blasting aliens and exploring far-off fantasy worlds than in stacking plastic bricks.progress -- it's a bitch."}
