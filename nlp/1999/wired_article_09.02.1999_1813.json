silicon valley temp agencies are sitting on a gold mine. by craig bicknell.", "author": "craig bicknell", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "09.02.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "there are lots of ways to get rich in silicon valley, but most depend on the luck of the stock-option draw and the favor of the market gods. not eugene lupario's way. nope, his method is practically foolproof. and it pays in cold, hard cash.lupario runs a company that farms out temporary tech workers in exchange for a huge chunk of their meaty pay. in a market where understaffed tech companies are begging for skilled short-term workers, lupario and his kind are feasting.\"everybody is getting fat,\" said lupario, president of silicon valley technical staffing. \"i don't know how you could not make money.\"why is tech staffing such a sure thing?for starters, there are more available jobs in silicon valley than skilled workers. moreover, the rapidly changing demands of the tech industry create lots of new, high-pressure, high-priority, but short-term jobs that require skilled temps.as a result, tech companies will pay a princely sum to firms like lupario's that can find them contractors, fast. some staffing firms command 40 percent or more of the pay of each contractor they send out.many contractors are paid well over us$100 an hour for assignments that last up to a year. that is to say, the money piles up fast.it gets better: staffing firms are often paid fees for contractors they don't even find.scores of tech companies will track down, interview, and approve a contractor, only to shuttle him over to a staffing firm before bringing him aboard. the staffing firm sends the contractor right back to the company -- at a 30 percent markup.\"the company will say, 'great, i've found you. now go sign up with one of our approved staffing agencies,\" said siobhan o'mahoney, a researcher at stanford university's center for work, technology, and organization. \"the staffing firms are going 'ka-ching, ka-ching.'\"why the heck are companies paying fees for contractors they find themselves?one big reason is the irs, said peggy smith, executive director of national association of computer consultant businesses, a trade group for temporary staffing agencies.the irs closely watches companies that hire contractors, monitoring them to make sure that they don't exploit the contractors by using them like regular employees while withholding expensive benefits and shirking employee payroll taxes.\"the irs makes it very difficult to hire an independent contractor without the risk of being audited,\" said smith. a failed audit can be a disaster. a company that has to pay a pile of back taxes, stock options, and benefits for a few dozen or hundred contractors could take a whopping hit to its bottom line.the irs makes public the 20-point questionnaire it uses to determine whether a company controls the way contractors work to such a degree that they should rightly be considered employees. but many companies are still wary.to protect themselves, they send contractors to a staffing agency that ostensibly knows the rules inside out. the contractor becomes an employee of the staffing agency, and the agency takes the responsibility of managing the contractors' time.\"by doing that, the companies are able to buy insurance, in a way,\" said stanford's o'mahoney. \"if they're audited they can say, 'he's not my employee, he's their employee.'\"in some cases, employers will actually force contractors it has already hired to either sign on with a staffing agency or hit the street.\"we had a [corporate] client with numerous [independent contractors]. they knew it was a problem, so we just had to convert them to being our employees,\" said priscilla azcueta, director of professional services at manpower san jose, a staffing agency. \"those that didn't want to consent couldn't continue working there.\"by hiring contractors from a staffing agency, companies also buy insurance of a different sort, said silicon valley technical staffing's lupario.say an e-commerce company hires a solo independent contractor that doesn't come from an agency. if that contractor does something monumentally negligent that crashes the web site and costs the company millions, it's not likely that the company can sue the contractor to recoup its losses. it can sue and win, but the contractor probably won't have the resources to pony up.but if the contractor comes from an agency, the company can sue and recoup, because the agencies carry hefty liability insurance policies.companies also like to use agency contractors because it can fire them at a moment's notice without sucking its hr department into reams of paper work and hassles over contract terms.\"you can terminate the person with a phone call, and you don't have to worry about jack,\" said lupario. of course, if the company likes the contractor, it can offer him a permanent position. easy come, easy go.there are many other ways that agencies save the hr department paperwork hassles, and that's a big part of their appeal, said john fox, a lawyer with fenwick & west in palo alto who advises companies on how to handle contractors.\"in the old days, companies were trying to manage their incumbent work force, temp firm employees, and a bunch of solo contractors. it just got too complex. none of the companies want the paperwork burden of tracking all these folks.\"the rate at which companies farm out work to staffing agency contractors is only going to increase, fox predicts.already, many companies hire out many of the tasks they think fall outside their core competency. doing so saves them a boatload of money in benefit costs, which can run up to 50 percent over an employee's salary cost, compared to the 30 or 35 percent fee that most staffing agencies charge.by farming out jobs to contractors, the company can keep its employee head count low, something wall street watches closely because it expects tech companies to be lean and nimble.it all adds up to big old dollar signs for the tech staffing agencies.\"anybody that tells you their business isn't booming, i'd say they suck at what they do,\" said lupario. \"i don't think there's a lot of people starving out there in the staffing industry.\""}
