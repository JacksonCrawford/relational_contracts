increased traffic, jam-packed parking, and an entertainment mall that may detract from the local cultural scene.\"we aim to be an immersive, interactive entertainment environment where our customers can spend an hour or a whole day,\" public relations manager timothy rodrigues said smoothly. \"we hope once people visit they may never want to leave.\"that's the worst news andrea buffa has heard all week. the executive director of journalism advocacy group media alliance, which operates its headquarters across the street from the metreon, said she's horrified by what's happening to the neighborhood.formerly a low-rent business district, this segment of san francisco downtown was developed into the luxuriant yerba buena gardens and the upscale moscone center some years ago. now she sees the area becoming more crowded and \"more and more like a mall\" with the opening of sony's squeaky-clean play palace.\"i'm against the city's selling of every tiny bit of real estate to megacorporations,\" she said. \"we're getting an old navy out here, we're getting a bloomingdale's. could we please balance out this development in some way to make room for nonprofits and small businesses?\"buffa said she recently had to renegotiate the lease for media alliance and that her rent increased significantly. she said other nonprofits in the area might be jeopardized by recent developments.other locals echoed the concerns of small movie houses, or grumbled over the metreon's provision of 137 parking spaces for a projected 12,000 daily visitors. nonetheless, visitors swarmed the metreon on its opening day pre-party saturday. and with a 15-screen movie theater including an imax screen, interactive exhibits, an arcade, and a gaggle of restaurants and shops, they may continue to do so. it's the most disney-like mall of them all and it's got a price tag to match: each of the metreon's non-movie attractions is $7 a pop. worth it for a walk-through rendition of where the wild things are or a life-sized look at how things work? time will tell.game time at the airtight garage, an arcade styled after the work of heavy metal artist jean \"moebius\" giraud -- minus the bosomy biker babes -- is similarly priced. metreon shops are geek-friendly and just as focused on separating metreon visitors from their money.however, the sell is not without its benefits. the sony style store invites consumers to play with and preview equipment from digicams to cd players.gamers can plop down at the playstation game bar, ask for any title from one of the preternaturally cheerful gametenders and play at the bar's free monitors to their hearts' content.the microsoftsf store, microsoft's first retail outlet, similarly encourages buyers to get their hands on software before plunking down cash. \"parking will be miserable, but if i can support a competitor to the disney store [in downtown sf] let me just whip out my credit card,\" joked san francisco chronicle columnist leah garchik, who gave the metreon a tentative thumbs up. other neighborhood groups are hoping the metreon will bring more visitors -- and spenders -- to the area.\"we expect people to be wandering into the center after or before the metreon,\" said chris culwell, publicist for the nearby yerba buena center for the arts.\"people in general more often go to the movies rather than going to the theater, but we offer something so different from the metreon that i don't think we're really in competition,\" said susie falk of the american conservatory theatre, one of san francisco's thriving theater groups.\"san francisco is a city with many cultural activities, and those who will choose the movies over them will continue to do so, metreon or not. frankly, i'm more worried about the single-screen theaters than us.\"\"we're not that worried about the competition,\" said dennis conroy, part-owner of the red vic movie house, a single-screen art house on haight street. \"but we're not crazy about the kind of mall mentality like the metreon where you would say 'hmm, should we go to the body shop or to the movies?' it's sooooo un-san francisco.\""}
