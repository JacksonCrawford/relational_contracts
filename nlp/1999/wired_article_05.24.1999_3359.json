individual investors this summer. but a lot of work remains to be done.", "author": "reuters", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "05.24.1999 09:15 AM", "text": "few on wall street know what its newest offspring, an after-hours trading session, will look like. but most say their biggest concern is that the new system will be healthy. those involved in the planning process are mum on the details. but investors probably will be able to trade stocks late in the day in some fashion this summer.the two largest american stock markets, the new york stock exchange and nasdaq, as well as rival electronic trading systems, are racing to devise systems to tap the growing number of investors who want to trade outside the six-and-a-half-hour trading day.demand pales compared to normal trading. one analyst estimates after-hours trading would be just 1 percent of us daily volume. but the number is expected to increase sharply and is seen as a link to small retail investors, whose stature has grown as they bypass brokers and trade from home. institutions know the early bird can set up precious relationships with traders and establish liquidity -- the lifeblood of a trading network.arthur levitt, chairman of the securities and exchange commission, said he would prefer to wait until wall street has dealt with any y2k issues before revamping the trading system. market forces, however, are accelerating the process. if established stock markets do not act, upstarts like eclipse trading, an alternative trading system, threaten to beat them. eclipse is planning a 6-9 p.m. online trading session.there are also worries that if trading is too thin, it would be easier to manipulate the markets, the sec has said.\"volume could be so thin, people could be asleep at the wheel if something happens,\" one floor trader said, worrying that adding hours to an already grueling day could invite fatigue and errors.currently, the dominant after-hours player is instinet, which focuses on large investors but is trying to attract small investors as well.a late-trading proposal goes to nasdaq's board on wednesday. if approved, a system could be up and running by this summer.the nyse, the world's largest stock exchange, will discuss after-hours trading at the exchange's monthly board meeting on 3 june, insiders say. nyse officials are meeting weekly with representatives of a group of upstart electronic trading systems, crafting a system to trade shares including nasdaq stocks.in april, nyse chairman richard grasso said the exchange was talking to several trading networks, including strike, brut, instinet, and a bloomberg-owned system. he said the nyse was developing an open architecture and he charged the group with devising a plan in which they would all plug into the nyse platform, pooling their liquidity.one of the biggest obstacles, he said, was pulling the disparate elements of the different electronic communication networks together, because many of them have ownership structures that are a tangled web of competing wall street houses, such as goldman sachs group and etrade group.several of these new systems are hungry, and hunting liquidity to style themselves not just as after-hours trading venues, but as a new breed of \"for profit,\" full-blooded stock exchange. the sec estimates that alternative trading systems trade 20 percent of the nasdaq volume and 4 percent of the volume in listed issues and predicts the numbers will triple in three years.planners face a raft of unresolved questions. the chief one is whether profits will justify the added costs of late trading, especially at exchanges that rely on people, like the nyse. no one seems sure how much demand is dormant.\"after-hours trading is coming. but i'm a little skeptical about how much volume there's going to be,\" said greg smith, an analyst at putnam lovell de guardiola and thorton in san francisco. \"i think initially it's going to remain focused on the most liquid names and stocks where there has been late news. this is a market that didn't even exist three to four years ago.\"then there are the logistics. the biggest cost would be the people involved to trade the stocks, regulate trading, and provide support. alternative trading systems use few people, giving them a cost advantage.high costs could speed consolidation among small market makers. sources said last week that dutch specialist firm van der moolen holding nv was in talks with several nyse specialists, including henderson brothers.after-hours trading could also complicate life for mutual funds and newspapers, which need to know and plan if there are suddenly going to be new final closing stock prices. many papers go to print before 9 p.m., and mutual funds analyze performance daily based on closing prices.\"i don't think companies have anticipated in the least the implications for them,\" said patrick healey of the issuer network. \"when can a company put out earnings? what happens if the market is moving in a stock, and the company is closed?\"copyright"}
