(never mind your tv's feelings about those quicktime quickies.) panja restores domestic harmony by putting the pc back in its place: the panja 1000 system, via cable or dsl modem, sends decoded net tunes and pictures directly to your stereo and television. and with various panja 2000 upgrades, the remote can be made even more universal, controlling less entertaining electronics from the dishwasher to the alarm system, and displaying internet content like weather, sports, and news. panja 1000: $2,495; 2000 upgrades from $250. panja: (800) 222 0193, www.panja.com.__ bowled over __zako's zm99 speakers look like this for a reason: the spherical shape bounces sound throughout the interior, avoiding distortion-causing resonances while producing mellow sounds. and unlike bass-deadening wood speakers, these wax-lined ceramic cabinets reflect frequencies uniformly. zako uses coaxial drivers, with concentric cones generating lows and highs from the same location. that arrangement, popular in car stereos, saves room and reduces interference. be warned: despite the lane-ready look, these orbs weren't made for bowling. zm99: $1,271 a pair. zako speakers: (888) 838 7807, www.zako.com.__ wintergreen lifesaver __statistically, the deadliest part of an avalanche comes after the fall, when your breath and melting snow form an ice mask that blocks your air supply. but visitors to the high country can breathe a little easier, thanks to the avalung. just bite the mouthpiece when the mountain starts to tumble, then wait for the snow to settle; the tube takes in fresh air through the vest's front and vents your exhalations safely behind you - no ice mask, no rapid death. just relax, so to speak, while your buddies follow your beacon signal and dig you out. you did remember to bring your beacon, didn't you? avalung: $198. black diamond equipment: +1 (801) 278 5533, www.avalung.com.__ casual specs __rather than risking high-five damage to your pricey field glasses, take bnox's slim to the game. the pocket-ready binoculars give you 7x magnification and surprisingly good optics for the price, and the wide-angle rectangular image feels more natural - and televisual - than a circular field. a quick tug adjusts the fit; you focus with a simple lever on top. and if you spike your bnox after the game-winning touchdown, you won't break your salary cap. slim 7x18: $19.95. bnox: +1 (212) 605 0410, www.bnox.com.__ key player __rather than spitting out clinically dissected audio samples, yamaha's new s80 simulates a musical instrument's entire physics. compare a sax played on an ordinary synth - striking a key soft, medium, and hard generates the same basic sound at three volumes. with the s80's virtual acoustic module, by contrast, you hear a breathy whisper, a normal note, and a coltrane-climactic squawk, just like when you blow the real thing. another swappable module mimics old analog synthesizers like the moog, and yet another processes vocal input to add harmonies, change voices from \"male\" to \"female,\" and perform other sleights of sound. s80: $1,995 (without modules). yamaha: (800) 889 2624, +1 (714) 522 9011, www.yamaha.com.__ quarter pounder __qualcomm's thin phone is 4.23 ounces well spent. the five-line lcd lets you access a 99-number address book, and the device supports paging, messaging, email, and microbrowsers with a compatible carrier service. an internal battery runs the 800-mhz dual-mode (cdma/analog) handset for two and a half hours of talking, and you can snap on external batteries in mid-conversation. like a fast-food burger, this non-ostentatious little package pulls more than its weight in convenience and available energy. qcp-860 thin phone: $149. qualcomm: (800) 349 4188, www.qualcomm.com."}
