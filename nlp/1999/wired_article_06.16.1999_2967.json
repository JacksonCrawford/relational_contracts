experience for curious viewers. beginning in april, pbs, with the help of intel, will deliver round-the-clock digitally enhanced programming.read more about digital tv- - - - - -digitally enhanced programs give viewers \"the opportunity to root around in the information and the ability to spend a much longer time with the content,\" said kevin dando, a spokesman for pbs.it's a perfect combination, said john tollefson, chief technology officer for pbs. \"dtv tends to benefit public television more than other kinds of television because of what our mission is: that is, to provide educational, cultural, and citizenship kinds of programs to the american public.\"in digital television, or dtv, the television signal is transmitted in digital form, a series of ones and zeros rather than in analog waves. it enables a network to broadcast more programming using the same amount of bandwidth.digital television is an umbrella term that comprises three specific technologies: multicasting, high-definition television, and data-casting.digital signals take up less space on the broadcast spectrum than analog, and that makes multicasting possible. one swath of bandwidth can be split so that one channel can become three or four. programs broadcast in high-definition television (hdtv) give viewers a sharper picture and cd-quality surround sound, but they take up too much bandwidth to allow multicasting. thus, a network can use its allotted bandwidth to multicast several regular digital shows or one hdtv program.data-casting is one use of multicasting in which a network can supplement a digitally broadcast television program with an information \"channel.\" since digital converters aren't yet available for televisions, viewers access data-casts through a pc with a dtv card.larry bozman, a spokesman for intel, compares data-casts to the inserts one might find in a magazine. the data accompanying a science program would contain additional information relating to the subject, just like a fold-out chart in a magazine. the data channel could offer a supplemental article, an interactive game, an interview clip, or e-commerce.part of intel's contribution to pbs' digital plan is the technology for the data-casting portion of the programming. \"this is a partnership where both sides are critical,\" said dando, the pbs spokesman. the network needed a sponsor and intel was interested in helping the service create digital programming.\"[intel's contribution is] technology, it's a lot of brainpower and money,\" dando said.\"we've always been interested in interactivity,\" said tom galvin, intel's director of market development for entertainment and education. as media companies have begun to embrace digital technologies, \"collaborations were kind of natural.\"intel and pbs have been partners before. last fall, they collaborated on a data-enhanced program about architect frank lloyd wright, which tested the new technology.in the special, viewers with dtv tuner cards in their pcs could explore interview footage, sketches, photographs, and virtual environments (for example, they could walk through a photo of wright's fallingwater). \"educators will be able to use this in the classroom, which is always a big goal of pbs,\" said dando.accessing the extra data will become even easier. pbs' tollefson predicts that viewers will soon be able to download data to their dtvs using a remote control.\"there's no question that within a year there will be dtv sets that will have that capability to receive and decode that additional data,\" said pbs' tollefson.so pbs is preparing digitally enhanced programming.\"we're ready with the technology whenever stations make the digital transition,\" said dara goldberg, associate director of corporate communications for pbs.the next digitally enhanced program will be wonders of the african world, hosted by henry louis gates, jr., chair of harvard's afro-american studies department. an exploration of african history and the origins of african culture, the program will air on 25 october.multicasting is particularly appealing to pbs because of the variety of programming that can be broadcast at once: pbs will offer up to four channels at one time, on the same space of bandwidth that could previously only carry one program. the pbs kids channel will be available to digital member stations in september, and more shows will follow in the next few years.\"it's sort of like a museum that has more paintings or books than we have shelf space for,\" said goldberg. \"at one time during the day we could have k-12 programming, a debate, a college-level course, and a how-to program,\" she said.\"you can offer more educational services to more people at one time and they can choose what they want to watch, so that fits pbs' spectrum perfectly.\"hdtv is also an important part of the pbs digital platform, especially for its history, nature, and performance programs. since november, pbs has broadcast at least one hdtv program per month. on 3 november, sahara will air in hdtv.the transition to digital programming began this year with the conversion of pbs, nbc, cbs, fox, and abc affiliates in the top 10 markets. according to an fcc mandate, all networks must be converted to digital format by 2006.the major networks' experiments with dtv have been limited to hdtv broadcasts. the greater resolution and digital sound create a more theater-like experience for viewers. so far, network hdtv programming has for the most part been confined to football games and movies, but in april nbc started broadcasting the tonight show in hdtv.pbs is more interested in the educational and informational values of the technology.\"for us, it's really about the content, programming, and educational services,\" said pbs' goldberg. \"we are dedicated to using our digital spectrum for public service, and no one else is doing that.\""}
