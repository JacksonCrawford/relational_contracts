adams doesn't favor a mass migration from silicon to smokestacks, but he does think there's a lot to be said for holding an increasingly diversified portfolio.\"diversification helps in a choppy or down market,\" he said. \"if you love a tech company and it's been good to you, i wouldn't get out of it completely. but if this stock is 20 percent of your portfolio, i'd pare it back to 5 percent.\"meanwhile, more fun over in telecom, where the jockeying for cable-operator mediaone group grows more interesting by the day. now come reports -- you know, the anonymously sourced kind -- that mci worldcom is set to enter the fray by joining with comcast to top a nearly us$60-billion bid for mediaone from at&t. speculation that comcast was eager to cozy up with either america online or microsoft appears to have petered out.mediaone told at&t over the weekend that it would accept its bid. comcast has until thursday to come up with a more toothsome offer.so why would mci want a piece of this action? good question. considering that the company has made no secret of the fact that it's shopping for a wireless phone carrier, it's hard to see why mci would be keen on stretching its resources even thinner by laying out a few billion for a cable outfit. the only upside, it seems, would simply be the satisfaction of having poked rival at&t in the ribs.investors had their doubts about any such deal, sending mci's (wcom) stock down $1.13 to $82.94. for its part, at&t (t) rose 13 cents to $51.19, and mediaone (umg) was $2.19 lower at $77.50. comcast (cmcsa) slid $1.81 to $64.13.from the ipo front, mapquest.com (mqst) soared 49 percent to $22.38 on its first trading day after debuting with 4.6 million shares initially priced at $15 apiece. the company is an online provider of, yup, maps. flycast communications (fcst), an online advertising firm, vaulted 19 percent to $29.75 as it weighed in with 3 million shares starting at $25 each.and here's something you don't see every day: a hot ipo that doesn't have a dot com in the mix. goldman sachs group (gs) climbed 33 percent to $70.38 after arriving with 69 million shares initially priced at a hefty $53 a pop. the $3.6 billion raised makes this the second-biggest offering by a us company, after the $4.4 billion scored by dupont's conoco unit last year.the previous title holder for second-biggest-offering honors was lucent technologies (lu), which dropped $1.63 to $57.88 even as it unveiled new applications that allow corporate users to share data via the net. elsewhere in telecom, qwest communications international slipped $1.44 to $81.56 after swiping afshin mohebbi from british telecom to serve as the fast-growing company's president and chief operating officer.on the tech scene, wang global (wang) advanced 12 percent to $28.63 after agreeing to be acquired by getronics nv of the netherlands for about $2 billion. this column has a soft spot for wang in that the first computer market cap ever owned, way back when, was made by the company. but wang never quite managed to ride the pc wave, and even had to file for bankruptcy protection from creditors in 1992.enjoy the tulips, dudes.in other wheeling and dealing, biotech firm centocor (cnto) rose $2.25 to $49.13 amid speculation that the company may be purchased by johnson & johnson for more than $3 billion. centocor has a popular anticlotting medicine called reopro that would give j&j greater standing in cardiovascular circles. johnson & johnson (jnj) shed $2.75 to $95.sara lee (sle) has its heart set on coffee roaster chock full o' nuts (chf), and isn't going to let a rejected buyout offer stand in its way. despite being spurned by chock full's board, sara lee is taking its takeover bid straight to the company's shareholders in hopes that they'll be more receptive to the idea. chock full percolated 88 cents higher to $10.31, while sara lee was down 81 cents at $21.94.lastly, cafe odyssey (cody), an operator of \"theme restaurants\" -- now there's a trend that's run its course -- sizzled up 42 percent to $2.94 as it agreed to purchase popmail.com, which provides email services to radio stations.you can see the fit. travel-themed eateries and radio email. total synergy."}
