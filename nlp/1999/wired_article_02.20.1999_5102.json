(this week's number one spot went to the goo goo dolls' song, \"iris.\")mp3 impact collects a variety of statistics from four channels: the web, ftp sites, hotline, and irc. bello enlisted analysts like john lee, a well-known former hacker involved in a new internet broadcasting initiative, and world wide web artist's consortium president bob ponce to help cull the information.through a combination of personal contacts, research, and log-file analysis, bello says his team collects information about the most popular pirated singles. some of the special contributors listed on the newsletter's masthead include prozac, numble, and pyrotechie.\"the riaa [recording industry association of america] could do this analysis, but they aren't,\" says bello. \"there was this need and it wasn't being met.\""}
