(fine print: lycos is now in the process of acquiring wired news' parent company.)in a nice bit of irony, meanwhile, shop at home (sath), the third-largest home-shopping retailer, plunged 32 percent to $13.56 after disappointing investors by failing to link up with an established portal. although shop at home said it will develop an online auction service -- who isn't these days? -- analysts had been looking for the company to expand its tv audience with the reach of an internet search engine.facing an image problem of its own, amazon.com (amzn) moved quickly to retreat from plans to whore out its site by allowing publishers to pay for featured recommendations. now amazon will make sure customers know that a glowing blurb is in fact a paid advertisement. nevertheless, the company's stock was caught in the vortex swallowing most net shares, and it was down $2.56 at $97.44.and here's one you could see coming a mile off: etrade group (egrp) is being sued by a customer for its system having crashed four times last week. \"as a result of this virtual lockout,\" the suit charges, \"class members lost potentially millions of dollars.\"or, considering the market's recent turbulence, they ended up saving potentially millions of dollars. the suit doesn't take that into account, though. etrade advanced $2.56 to $42.75.network solutions (nsol) rose $5.88 to $153.88 after reporting fourth-quarter profit of 22 cents a share, a couple of pennies higher than estimates. this may not last, though, now that a government panel has issued guidelines for other companies to offer internet-domain registrations.general instrument (gic) gained $1.69 to $33.31 after posting quarterly income of 26 cents a share, topping expectations by 3 cents. the leading us maker of cable-tv set-top boxes said sales are increasing as the number of cable subscribers increases.microsoft (msft) was up 56 cents at $160.63 as the company's chief financial officer, greg maffei, said redmond is stewing on a new batch of mergers and partnerships with web-related outfits. he noted that the current drop in prices for most net shares could hasten such moves.elsewhere in tech, dell computer (dell) slipped 81 cents to $97, while international business machines (ibm) was $6.13 higher at $168.88. intel (intc) gained $3.50 to $128.81, and cisco systems (csco) was up $2.63 at $98.56.amr (amr), parent of american airlines, shook off the effects of a sick-out by disgruntled pilots. as more than a third of its flights were canceled, a federal judge ordered an end to the protest. the pilots are unhappy with the carrier's acquisition of reno air, and how reno's pilots will be integrated with existing rank and file. amr rose 50 cents to $56.lastly, bestfoods (bfo) climbed $1.56 to $48.50 as the mayo-maker hit estimates with fourth-quarter earnings of 64 cents a share, excluding charges and all that other accounting stuff. and here's something you probably didn't know: bestfoods is a component of the planetclick 500 stock index of \"companies with the top user-rated web sites in the planetclick universe.\"while not all investors will regard possessing a decent web site as a sign of a firm's fiscal vitality, where else can a well-informed person turn to discover bestfoods' position on mad cow disease?"}
