[gfn.com] offers information, and the web allows people in the midwest to have access to the same information\" that gay investors in new york or san francisco have, he says.gfn.com is being highly selective about its advertising partnerships -- both for the ads it accepts and the placement of its own banners. the site will neither accept nor post ads on adult-oriented sites. ads on the motley fool, however, are bringing in 40 to 50 new registered members a day.the site, which is free, currently requires registration -- which can be anonymous -- to access many of its features.historically, gay people have been early adopters in the online world. as far back as 1996, simmons market research found that 52 percent of the gay people in its study sample subscribed to an online service, as opposed to 15 percent of heterosexuals."}
