meter coins may be coming to an end. hello, easypark. tania hershman reports from jerusalem.", "author": "tania hershman", "category": "science", "type": "article", "timestamp": "11.22.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "jerusalem -- parking meters, those immovable sidewalk institutions, are turning portable. soon, you'll be able to keep one in your car, in the form and shape of a handheld device. when the noncontact parking smartcard called easypark becomes available throughout israel in january 2000, it could mark the beginning of a new way the world pays to park its cars.easypark is a pda-sized unit that's \"like an in-vehicle parking meter,\" said easy park gm eran tamir, whose company is a subsidiary of ontrack innovations, the developers of the technology.the battery-less easypark unit can only be used as a parking meter when it is actually charged up with cash at atm-like point-of-sale machines. a swipe of a credit card or insertion of cash transfers money to the smartcard.after parking, the driver turns on easypark and attaches it to the windshield or the driver's side window, where a meter reader can see it. by pointing a handheld device, the reader can tell if the unit is operating, whether the card has money in it, and if it is charging the driver the correct fee for the particular parking zone.if not, the driver will be fined on the spot, avoiding the costly and time-consuming -- not to mention aggression-provoking -- issuance of a parking ticket.in haifa, one of israel's largest urban centers, easypark's technology has been on trial since may, under the auspices of the haifa municipality, in conjunction with the local government economic services organization (the israeli governmental body responsible for assisting local authorities).\"it was an experiment with 1,500 units,\" explains izzy inbar, head of haifa municipality's operations department. \"the aim was to see how people took to the device and how they and the meter readers used it.\"six months down the line, inbar feels very positive about easypark. \"it is easy to use and it is always available,\" he says. \"at the end of the day we are happy with it.\"inbar's attitude to the device seems to be indicative of a generally warm reception. says the spokesperson for the local government economic services organization: \"according to a survey performed by an independent institution, people are very satisfied with the [easypark] smartcard. the officials at the haifa municipality have thus accepted the smartcard as a good solution to the issue of national parking cards, and have expressed satisfaction with its operation so far.\"given these positive results, the local government economic services organization has decided that easypark will be launched nationally on 2 january, 2000. the aim is to sell 150,000 units by the end of next year, primarily to those in and around tel aviv, located in the center of the country.however, before it adopts easypark wholeheartedly, inbar says that the haifa municipality still has to weigh up logistical issues, such as how exactly parking fees and fines will be transferred to the municipality, and also to ensure there are no legal impediments to using the unit.the final decision will be taken within the next two months, but even if it is pro-easypark, this will not mean the end of traditional meters. \"our approach is to have a variety of methods so that it is easier for the citizen to pay,\" inbar said.if haifa says yes, easypark will handle all the distribution and maintenance of the units, the clearing of funds, and the points of sale. the municipality just has to sit back and wait for the money to roll in.another advantage is that when it is time to raise parking fees, this can be done online, and the easypark unit will be updated the next time it is recharged with money.in haifa, the first few hundred units were given away for free, and the remaining were sold for $15, which is probably slightly less than the rest of israel will be charged.it seems illogical to make drivers pay for something that will then cost them more money, but they benefit too, claims tamir, because drivers only pay for precisely the amount of time they are parked, rather than to the nearest quarter hour or more.\"i think it is great,\" says haifa's joel freilich, an advertising executive who bought an easypark device six months ago. \"i would leave the car for 5-10 minutes without paying for parking thinking that it would be ok. and most of the time i would get a ticket. easypark is a lot cheaper.\"freilich liked it so much he bought one for his wife. \"it is always handy ... in the glove compartment.\"while the units in haifa were only being used for curbside parking in designated parking zones, in the future the technology will be extended to private and public parking lots, where the driver will only have to flash his easypark on the way in and out.easypark still is no solution to the problem of those who double-park or mount pavements in a pedestrian-unfriendly manner in no-parking zones.\"this unit is not going to solve the lack of parking spaces,\" says tamir."}
