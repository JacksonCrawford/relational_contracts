they can display their wares in cyberspace, and store and ship them from just a few locations.a recent epa analysis concluded that energy savings from reduced construction alone could mean that the standard estimates for us energy and carbon dioxide emissions in 2010 may be overstated by the equivalent of 175 power plants and 300 million metric tons of co2.such a drastic revision in that figure would significantly reduce both the difficulty and the cost to the united states of hitting targets set by the kyoto protocols, the international climate change treaty negotiated in december 1997.romm\u2019s report predicts that by 2007, consumer and business e-commerce could remove the need for 1.5 billion square feet of office space -- about 5 percent of the nation\u2019s total -- along with up to 1 billion square feet of warehouses. internet technology may also eliminate as much as 2 billion square feet of commercial office space -- the equivalent of almost 450 sears towers.through reduced operations and maintenance alone, that translates to about 53 billion kilowatt hours of energy saved each year -- the output of more than 21 average power plants -- and 67 trillion btus worth of natural gas.which prevents the release of 35 million tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. by avoiding construction of all those unneeded buildings, the united states saves the equivalent of 10 more power plants worth of energy and another 40 million metric tons of greenhouse pollution.\"the internet can turn buildings into web sites, and replace warehouses with supply chain software,\" said romm. \"in some sense, the internet allows the replacement of physical materials with electrons.\"some companies are using the internet to help determine what people really want to buy, so that they can avoid making goods that no one wants. many computer companies now let consumers pick and choose what components to include in their new computers, which allows the company to better determine what items consumers value, and reduces the number of unwanted components taking up warehouse space.\"there\u2019s no bigger expense of energy than manufacturing the wrong product, shipping it to a warehouse and having it sit there,\" says romm.other companies are \"recycling\" goods that are already built. online auction houses sell millions of dollars in pre-owned items. by buying used goods, buyers avoid encouraging the consumption of raw materials. \"people don\u2019t often think about the energy represented by materials,\" romm notes. \"any time you can save raw materials, you\u2019re saving a lot of energy.\"copyright environment news service (ens) 1999"}
