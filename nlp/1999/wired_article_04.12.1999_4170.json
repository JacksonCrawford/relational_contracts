the online community builder said it's in talks with a potential suitor about buying a controlling stake in the company, but declined to say who that suitor might be. the rumor mill quickly named a likely suspect: nbc, which has made no secret of its desire for a greater presence on the web. xoom (xmcm) climbed $6.75 to $76.88 amid speculation that a buyout is imminent.for its part, cbs (cbs) slipped 19 cents to $44.75 after saying it will purchase a 35 percent stake in a new joint venture that will run the hollywood.com online movie site, and that it will spend millions promoting its internet properties. the network's joint-venture partner, big entertainment (bige), soared 106 percent to $32.38.investors still think online brokerages can do no wrong. ameritrade (amtd), which is slated to report its quarterly earnings on thursday, surged 23 percent to $142.25. etrade group (egrp), meanwhile, advanced $5.88 to $96 as it unveiled a new ad campaign aiming to be \"a strong call to action in the age of self-reliance and personal empowerment,\" as one company official termed it.this is investing we're talking about here, right?you can't fault a company for championing its own success, but you have to wonder why traders are sometimes so willing to buy into the hype. case in point: net.b@nk (ntbk), an online financial institution, vaulted 33 percent to $158.50 after its chief exec, dr grimes, told an interviewer that the company is expanding faster than earlier estimated. subsequent news reports touted net.b@nk's forecast of a 51 percent increase in growth.um, ok. except here's what grimes actually said: \"if i added 3,300 accounts last month, right? i've got nine more months left this year, right? so if you do the math, that'd be 29,000. and i'm sitting at a little over 24,000. so, maybe 53,000. i'm just giving you a rough number ... i'm simply saying that if we continue to grow at the rate we grew last month, we're looking at an obviously much bigger number. so even if you took those numbers and added them together, you would still be looking at a number much above the 35,000 that we had been projecting.\"similarly, when asked about a possible stock split, grimes observed, \"we do have a shareholder's meeting coming up, don't we?\"yes, we do. and maybe net.b@nk really is poised for greatness. but more levelheaded investors will wait to see the company actually come through with the goods before driving its share price through the roof.lastly, hj heinz (hnz), the ketchup guys, rose $1.69 to $46.25 after the financial times reported that more than 20 prospective buyers have stepped forward to acquire the company's weight watchers international unit.there will be those who wonder what the producer of ore-ida tater tots is doing in the diet business in the first place. but, hey, it's no less mystifying that a top player in the get-slim movement also happens to be one of the world's leading manufacturers of pet food."}
