neuroblastoma. michael is one of 103 children from the township who are part of the nation's largest child cancer cluster. \"in our situation drinking groundwater contamination from industrial toxic waste is definitely a potential cause,\" says gillick, executive director of the not-for-profit group ocean of love. toms river, a part of dover township, is located about 65 miles south of new york. toms river, with beaches on the barnegat bay and the atlantic ocean, has been a tourist attraction for years.in an ongoing investigation, state environmental officials have discovered over 4,500 drums of toxic liquid from union carbide corporation were dumped in the dover township municipal landfill and a local farm one mile north of the wellfield used for drinking water in toms river.a closed chemical plant owned by ciba specialty chemicals, which was declared a superfund toxic waste site, is also part of the investigation. the 5.2-acre disposal area containing about 100,000 drums of chemical waste was capped in 1978, but an epa document in 1989 says, \"groundwater contamination is migrating from these inactive disposal sites easterly towards the toms river.\"\"the government thought the drinking water could be cleaned up by filtering it with air filters but what people don't realize is you have thousands of chemicals being produced without toxicological testing and drinking water regulators are only required to check for 80 substances,\" says gillick. \"our standards for safeguarding drinking water aren't keeping up with the chemicals being produced.\"after accidents, cancer is the largest killer of children in the united states, according to the national cancer institute and the national childhood cancer foundation, and cancer in children is on the rise. childhood cancer occurs in one in every 330 children by the age of 19, says the pediatric oncology resource center.brain, nervous system cancers, and acute lymphocytic leukemia represent the majority of cancers attacking children. clusters of these cases are occurring in regions where drinking water has been contaminated by carcinogenic volatile organic compounds (vocs) discharged by industry and municipalities into underground sources of drinking water (usdw).vocs identified by the environmental protection agency as potential cancer causing agents are associated with the child cancer clusters in toms river, new jersey; winona, texas; port st. lucie, florida; and woburn, massachusetts.in the woburn cluster -- made famous by the book and the 1998 film a civil action, starring john travolta -- 21 children contracted leukemia in a town where drinking groundwater was contaminated from a shallow industrial injection well and dump.state epidemiologists in winona, texas, are investigating 14 cases of child cancer in a township of 500 people where a deep injection well accepting hazardous substances (class 1 uic well) was contaminating the groundwater and air with vocs and radioactive waste.in port st. lucie, florida, 29 children have contracted brain tumors and nervous system cancers in a region where industrial and municipal underground injection wells are illegally discharging into underground sources of drinking water.child cancer clusters are also being investigated in rochester, new york; christian county, illinois; and mcfarland, california.the scale of toxins entering drinking groundwater supplies through the environmental protection agency's underground injection control program is huge.over 60 percent of the land-disposed liquid hazardous waste in the united states is injected underground via 600 government-permitted class 1 uic wells, according to the not-for-profit ground water protection council. the epa says that nationwide there are over one million shallow class v uic wells used by industry, farms, and businesses to discharge toxins into underground sources of drinking water.toxins are also entering groundwater in increasing amounts from hazardous waste dumps. a 1997 report from the federal agency for toxic substances and disease registry, \"the toxicological hazard of superfund hazardous waste sites,\" analyzed over 1,300 superfund sites listed by the epa. the report found over 41 million americans live within four miles of these toxic land dumps where an increase in toxic waste exposure pathways is at a level threatening public drinking groundwater. the report also cites office of technology assessment estimates of 436,000 hazardous waste sites nationwide.historically, cluster investigations have been used by scientists to identify environmental factors causing a disease such as the outbreak of legionnaire's disease in the 1970s from contaminated water in air conditioning ducts.but state and federal epidemiologists investigating contamination of drinking water by carcinogenic vocs from underground injection wells and hazardous waste dumps claim they could not find any evidence the contaminating carcinogens were a factor in any child cancer cluster. they claim a true child cancer cluster has never been proven in the united states.\"a cluster investigation is designed to answer [the question: is there too much cancer? and not why it happened,\" says barry wilson, an epidemiologist with the texas cancer registry who investigated the winona, texas, child cancer cluster.\"the true term for a child cancer cluster is, is it meaningful,\" says wilson. \"and meaningful is defined: if there is an excess in a geographic area in a particular time period; if it is statistically significant by sex, age, race; if all groups were equally exposed; is there an exposure pathway; and then if there is biologically plausibility to cause that cancer.\"\"i've done over 500 of these cluster investigations, and we have nothing in texas that meets the criteria of a meaningful child cancer cluster,\" he says.state and federal government cancer registries refuse to list child cancer clusters under investigation even though epidemiologists have cited large statistical numbers of specific cancer outbreaks in the towns toms river, port st. lucie, and winona.\"most scientists don't see value in studying child cancer clusters,\" says dr. holly howe, executive director of the north american association of central cancer registries.\"usually child cancer clusters involve small numbers of cases and most studies funded require several hundred cases for proper statistical inquiry to calculate level of risk,\" she says. \"we don't know what causes child cancer clusters, but the environment and exposure to carcinogens is not a strong contributor,\" says dr. howe.environmentalists and concerned doctors disagree.\"i have no doubt certain vocs in drinking water can cause cancer in children,\" says dr. philip landrigan, chair of the department of community and preventive medicine at mount sinai school of medicine, in new york, and a former special adviser to the office of children's health protection of the epa.\"i think there is a strong potential for vocs in drinking water to have caused the cancer in the child cancer clusters in toms river, winona, woburn, and port st. lucie,\" says dr. landrigan.\"the concern we have is that drinking water standards are not protective of the public's health, particularly children,\" says carolyn poppell, program coordinator on safe drinking water for physicians for social responsibility.the environmental protection agency has designated a list of chemicals, metals, and known carcinogenic volatile organic compounds to be monitored in drinking water for established maximum contaminant levels (mcls) by utilities.critics of the epa's monitoring list for maximum contaminant levels of toxins in drinking water say the agency only monitors for 80 substances while there are over 75,000 chemicals produced in the united states. critics point out that data on human health effects exists for only seven percent of the 2,700 most widely used chemicals.\"the epa's mcls in drinking water are not designed to protect children because they are extrapolated from animal studies and based on an adult male's body weight and water consumption,\" says poppell.\"infants and children are very vulnerable to exposure to known carcinogenic vocs in drinking water, yet there are no environmental regulations based on studies to specifically protect them,\" she says.according to child cancer activists, chemical corporations are financially and politically pressuring health organizations and the epa to keep it that way. \"there currently isn't enough scientific data to connect child cancer to chemical exposure,\" says lois gibbs, executive director of the not-for-profit center for health, environment and justice. gibbs spearheaded the citizens' action campaign against the toxic chemicals at love canal in new york.\"the fortune 500 petrochemical industries would have the most to lose if the link is made between chemicals and child cancer, and they design studies with their funding so there will not be conclusive evidence to make that link,\" gibbs says.government health and environmental officials insist current drinking water standards do protect children. they do say there have not been studies conducted on short-term effects of the exposure of children to chemical carcinogens or on child cancer clusters. \"most vocs zip out of the body and don't accumulate,\" says jeanette wiltse, director of the health & ecological criteria division of the office of science & technology at the epa's office of water. wiltse acknowledges that the banned pesticide ddt is an exception and does accumulate in human tissues.\"some mcls in drinking water are tailored for children -- lead and nitrate -- but we look at the effect of carcinogens through an epidemiological approach which is total dose over an adult's life time,\" says wiltse.according to janet wiltse if a child cancer cluster was proven to be caused by exposure to chemical carcinogens then the government would conduct an epidemiological study for a new risk assessment similar to those for lead and nitrate.\"i don't know where they have nailed a chemical contaminant in drinking water to a child cancer cluster, but if we had information on a suspected compound we would do a short-term exposure study,\" says wiltse. most studies cited by government organizations show cancer in children is due to genetic problems, but funding is lacking for studies of environmental chemical exposure to children.\"there haven't been a lot of studies on child cancer clusters, and you need many cases and funding, and they don't exist,\" says dr. howe.\"our investigations have been criticized as being flawed because our methods haven't once proven an environmental connection with cancer, but maybe we are just not smart enough yet,\" says wilson.president bill clinton on 21 april, 1997 released executive order 13045: protection of children from environmental health risks and safety risks, which takes account of \"a growing body of scientific knowledge demonstrating children may suffer disproportionately from environmental health risks and safety risk.\" these risks are due to children's developing biological state and consumption of more food, fluids, and air in proportion to their body weight than adults, according to the executive order.\"each federal agency shall make it a high priority to identify and access environmental health risks and safety risks that may disproportionately effect [sic] children and shall ensure that its policies, programs, activities, and standards address disproportionate risks to children that result from environmental health risks or safety risks,\" clinton ordered.in 1997, the environmental defense fund (edf) released a report claiming there was a lack of publicly available data on the health effect of 2,700 us high production volume (hpv) chemicals. on 9 october, 1998 vice president gore announced an agreement between the chemical manufacturers association (cma), the environmental protection agency, and edf for companies to voluntarily test the human health and environmental effects of hpv chemicals they produce and complete testing by the year 2004.the 1996 safe drinking water act amendments requires the epa to release a list of contaminants not subject to the current national primary drinking water regulations. on 2 march, 1999 the epa published a list of new contaminants, the drinking water contaminant candidate list, or ccl.\"the final epa ccl of 50 chemicals and 10 microbiological contaminants is not a regulation but an agenda of priorities for development of new regulations for contaminants in drinking water over the next five years,\" says evelyn washington, assistant branch chief in the targeting & analysis branch of the epa's office of ground water and drinking water. this year the us geological survey (usgs) national water quality assessment program (nawqa) has initiated a new project in cooperation with the american water works association to address vocs in drinking water aquifers in greater detail.\"vocs in usdw are a concern for nawqa because vocs, such as solvents, fuels, fuel additives, and disinfection by-products are frequently detected in ground water and many vocs have been identified as having carcinogenic or other adverse health effects,\" says glenn patterson, a us geological survey (usgs) hydrologist with the national water quality assessment program.\"generally, anything that can cause cancer in adults can cause cancer in children, and children are considered more susceptible to cancer because their cells are multiplying more rapidly than those of adults,\" says patterson.in january 1999, the epa national center for environmental assessment's science advisory board recommended the guidelines for carcinogen risk assessment specifically address children's health.\"we haven't investigated child cancer clusters, and mcls are still determined over an adult's life time not a child's,\" says jackie moya, spokeswoman for the epa's national center for environmental assessment. the gap between government's actions to respond to child exposure to environmental carcinogens and policy making to protect their health has dr. philip landrigan concerned.\"the question is where our society's priorities are,\" he says. \"do you act on the presumption some chemicals in drinking water cause child cancer based on tests on animals or wait for an outbreak of cases.\"copyright
