articles on the rich and wired, like the boorish mike bloomberg? come on, tell us how this technology is changing our lives, show us people who are finding happiness and using it to have better lives, not just some creep who adds a few zeros to his net worth.__ kirk mcelhearnkirk@mcelhearn.com ____ armchair generalizations __so, i'm reading \"the wired diaries\" (wired 7.01, page 97) and i'm thinking, \"wow, these folks are full of remarkable insights about how technology affects our lives.\" then another thought hits me: \"these folks are full of crap.\" i don't mean to imply that their thoughts are not interesting or sincere. i'm referring to the article as a whole; you're talking to generals about what war is like. they might've known the front lines once, but now they're top brass - thinking big thoughts and making strategic decisions. next time show us \"the wired diaries\" written by techno-grunts who are in the trenches.__ mark oehlertoehlert@erols.com ____ institutionalized __articles like \"look who's talking\" (wired 7.01, page 128), about how the amish are dealing with cellular phones, are why i subscribe to wired and why i always go through it cover to cover. i can read about new technology elsewhere, but you explore where technology is taking us, as individual human beings and as a society. the only other place i've found this macro view of who we are and why is smithsonian magazine. smithsonian is where we've been; wired is where we're going.__ peter shawpeter.shaw@usace.army.mil ____ facing y2k __after reading howard rheingold's article on the amish and their use of technology, i stopped to ponder an interesting fact: the amish are almost completely y2k compliant. they don't rely on the power grid, and they grow their own food. they don't have internet connections, and they don't trust in embedded chips. in the worst-case scenario, they would again be without phones, which i'm sure would be taken as a sign from god to continue in the tradition of face-to-face relations set forth by the amish old order. perhaps this will truly be the new world order.__ christian nommesendove7@aloha.net ____ the weather channeler __the weather prediction piers corbyn made last december for valentine's day in paris (\"corbyn predicts,\" wired 7.02, page 104) was especially interesting to this paris resident. sunday the 14th started out as another cold, clear spring day, just like the previous four. jet contrails were the only things in the blue sky by 11 a.m., but by 1:30 p.m. high clouds started to move in. by 6 p.m., a heavy mist settled down with the smog, but there was still no sign of the predicted rain. such changes are typical for this time of year, and it hadn't rained for many weeks, though it had snowed.surprise! monday morning the streets and footpaths were covered in water. it had indeed rained heavily on the night of the 14th. not only did corbyn forecast the end of four days of clear skies, but he accurately predicted heavy rain - rather than snow, or fog. amazing.__ geoffrey sinclairsinclair@montrouge.wireline.slb.com ____ scratching the surface __i made my friends scratch the cover of wired 7.01 before i scratched mine. before they told me what it said, ideas ran rampant thorough my head. quick! the future is all about ... y2k, computers, technology.\"how disappointing,\" one of them said. \"it's all about people.\"i would have it no other way.i'm 15 and am unimaginably affected by what happens around me. i remember my family's first computer. we had prodigy and i played games while sitting on my father's lap. i don't remember what the machine looked like, how big it was, or the brand; i remember playing with my dad.__ julia novitchthesilly@erols.com ____ gleaming the cube __as the former director of technology for chiat/day, i found warren berger's article about the agency's virtual office (\"lost in space,\" wired 7.02, page 76) oddly retro. after all these years of proselytizing the future, who'd have thought wired would turn out to be an advocate for the cubicle?chiat/day's virtual office was a wildly ambitious attempt to pull off in six months what most companies will take the next 20 years to achieve. in a world of spiraling real estate costs and an increasingly mobile workforce, the idea of network computing and shared space with communal resources is inevitable.i often liken chiat/day's experiment to kitty hawk. were orville and wilbur's 12 seconds aloft a success or a failure? jay chiat may have been cranky, bullheaded, and unrealistic. but give the rest of the world about two decades, and he'll also be right.__ stevan alburtyalburty@workvirtual.com ____ boxed in __i felt mysteriously uncomfortable reading warren berger's expos\u00e9 of a novel idea gone horribly wrong in \"lost in space.\" i certainly tip my hat to jay chiat and his flock for sacrificing their space in the name of innovation. as one who's spent time cowering in a cubicle, i understand chiat's need to shake things up. but after reading about the demise of his bold experiment, it's clear that thinking outside of the box is much easier than living there.__ curt poffcurt@nando.net ____ old-timer __regarding the millennium clock pictured in \"millennium timepiece\" (wired 7.01, page 43), i was interested to see that it uses a pendulum invented by john harrison in the 1730s, during his ultimately successful quest to build the first timepiece accurate enough to measure longitude.in 1722, harrison built a clock in northern england that has run continuously since; it's still accurate to the minute and has never been overhauled or repaired. constructed of tropical lignum vitae wood, which is full of oil and never runs dry, the clock shows no sign of wear.perhaps the long now foundation has a competitor with a 274-year head start.__ john inghamjohn.ingham@cwcom.co.uk ____ just say bo __i was thrilled to read \"he's got guanxi!\" (wired 7.02, page 122). i spend a great deal of time in china and rarely see coverage in the west that gets it right. the story made me feel like i was dropped back into zhongguancun, which, when you're there, seems like the center of the universe - a wild world filled with hope and opportunity. westerners rightly criticize china for its human rights record, but it's unrealistic to expect the chinese to comprehend, let alone share, western values.as your article shows, china is changing. human rights and democracy will come when the quality of life improves and information filters in. repressive governments survive by controlling information and the economy, but the chinese government is losing its grip on both. china's heroes are bo feng and the other idealistic businesspeople who are, as venture capitalist sandy robertson says, the ones \"creating the country's future.\" i hope wired will continue to chronicle their successes.__ byron rogersbyron_byron_byron@yahoo.com ____ putting the pr in the prc __china's emerging venture capital industry will be internally driven according to chinese characteristics, not the high-intensity glitz hyped in \"he's got guanxi!\" the article doesn't explain why china will adopt the venture capital model, nor how, when, or where the vc model will be rolled out; instead, it focuses on the periphery and presents a silicon valley, pr-centric view that demonstrates a lack of understanding of the facts, the forces driving change, and the real chinese players. guess what? the real players don't publicize their guanxi, live trans-pacific lifestyles, or stay at the portman ritz-carlton, shanghai.__ jack fensterstockchinacap@erols.com ____ eyes on the prize __at first, i couldn't understand why wired used such a low-res photo of est\u00e9e lauder companies' vp of special markets and new media, angela kapp (\"business model,\" wired 7.02, page 69). a closer look revealed not a resolution problem, but the faint url of est\u00e9e lauder's web site, www.clinique.com, printed across her face.i've heard that the fight for eyeballs is getting hot and heavy, but this is ridiculous!__ keith l. karolyikeithk2@worldnet.att.net ____ undo __school credit: it was the university of pennsylvania's eniac that first ran lewis fry richardson's calculations (\"everyone complains about the weather. piers corbyn is doing something about it,\" wired 7.02, page 100). ... roaming numeral: e.t.: the extra-terrestrial was released in 1982 (\"product (re)placement,\" wired 7.02, page 66). ... confused sole: the asics gel-kayano duosole (wired 7.02, page 146) is actually in the forefoot of the running shoe.__ send your rants & raves to: __email: rants@wiredmag.comsnail mail: wired, po box 191826 san francisco, ca 94109-9866editorial guidelines: guidelines@wiredmag.comeditorial correspondence: editor@wiredmag.com"}
