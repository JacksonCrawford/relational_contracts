at lower cost is a banker's dream, and nowhere more so than in wired-up sweden. like neighboring finland, another pioneer in internet banking, sweden has one of the world's highest penetrations of internet connections.hundreds of thousands of swedes already use the internet to pay bills, trade stocks and buy mutual funds and in a few years more than half of all bank customers could be using the net.see also: bankers don't get the net -- yet- - - - - -absolute numbers of internet clients are still low compared with some us banks, but as a proportion of total customers all four major swedish banks have reached a high penetration.\"sweden and finland are becoming the first countries in the world where a significant proportion of the population is using the internet to communicate with their bank,\" said lehman brothers banking analyst ian mcewen.this lead could see swedish banks being revalued against their european peers.at the end of june investment bank merrill lynch raised its recommendation on swedbank to \"accumulate\" from \"neutral,\" citing the bank's rapid growth in internet clients.but if the internet can cut a bank's costs and help them sell products, it offers the same to competitors, increasing price competition and lowering barriers to new entrants.so the net impact on an individual bank's profitability, and the whole sector's valuation, remains unclear.\"you can't quantify the bottom line impact,\" said mcewen. \"but we'll get to know what it means in sweden first.\"swedish banks net customersthe low cost of internet banking could help swedish banks, with ambitions for the whole baltic rim, to tackle markets elsewhere in scandinavia, northern germany and poland.but in the same way, it could expose them to foreign competition, especially once sweden joins the single european currency, lowering entry barriers to what many big european players now view as a marginal market.sweden's lead in internet banking was highlighted in a survey released last month by computer maker ibm.the survey rated 45 international banks by six key criteria -- accessibility, navigability, customer service, content, technical performance, and brand experience.citibank headed the list, but swedbank was in second place, followed by swedish-finnish bank meritanordbanken and then seb.the fourth big swedish bank, handelsbanken, less aggressive about promoting internet services, did not make the top 10.swedbank chief executive reinhold geijer predicts swedbank will be the biggest internet bank in northern europe with over one million customers in two years.gert engman, head of internet banking at swedbank, says this number could be reached even sooner, and the bank could see two million internet customers in three years -- not bad given a total swedish population of about 8.8 million.\"the internet is to retail banking what satellite and cable were to television,\" he said. \"we're looking at a fundamental change.\"swedbank does not see internet banking as a profit center, but as something complementary to its other operations. now in its second year, internet banking is still paying off the investment, but should be profitable next year, engman said.swedbank's initial goal is to lock in the loyalty of existing clients, who could be vulnerable to approaches from other banks and new entrants.\"it's our strategy to concentrate on our present customers for at least the next few years,\" engman said.seb, which already has 260,000 internet customers, has been focusing on existing customers but also wants to win new ones.\"we see a large potential of transferring more but to be truly successful we need to attract new customers as well,\" said dan tavares, seb's head of internet banking. seb's long-term goal is five million customers within five years. that cannot come from sweden alone, where there is a probable ceiling for the bank of about one million.growth will be mainly in the other nordic countries, through organic growth or acquisitions.\"we have an ambition to be the biggest bank in northern europe, so we have the baltics and maybe poland and northern germany,\" said tavares, adding the baltic states could leapfrog branch and telephone banking straight into the internet.again, at seb internet banking is not yet profitable, unless you strip out the investment and marketing costs.swedbank sees the internet taking over routine transactions, producing enormous savings. but with its roots in sweden's savings banks it wants to keep a local presence and does not expect to close branches because of internet banking.\"my very strong feeling is that the internet in various forms and using various tools will be the mass office in the future and the branch office will switch over to the place where you go for expert advice,\" engman said.laser precisionthe web will also enable banks to target clients for new products, raising revenues as well as cutting costs.this is one of the major benefits of the internet for seb, already the nordic region's biggest asset manager, and keen to build up this side of the business.tavares said the bank will use the internet to sell anything asset-related, from stockbroking to life assurance.internet technology will enable banks to generate tools and reports for clients \"with laser precision\" to help them decide what they want, and sites can be personalized, engman said.\"with the help of technology we will be able to tailor products to particular customer groups,\" he said.swedbank is already selling pension funds and trading equities with its current 240,000 internet customers, and has found that clients tend to visit the internet site four to six times a month, against once a quarter to the branch.the internet accounts for 10 to 15 percent of its payments transactions and the figure is rising dramatically by the month.at seb the figure is still higher, with 38 percent of bill payments, 20 percent of stock transactions and 10 to 11 percent of mutual funds transactions.just click and payswedish banks are taking payments one stage further with electronic bill presentment, which produces an image of a bill on a client's web account. the customer clicks and it's paid.swedbank and nordbank have teamed up with one system, giving the two banks access to 70 to 75 percent of sweden's salaried population, and swedbank expects to have 40 to 50 utilities and other companies signed up to the system by the end of the year.seb is working on another system with the clearing agency bankgirot, and postgirot bank has a third alternative. bankers hope these different versions will eventually be standardized.millions of customers regularly visiting their sites could also allow banks to move into non-financial products, and seb is starting to look at relationships with other merchants to develop e-commerce, selling anything from flowers to tickets. but mcewen of lehman brothers doubts banks can move outside financial services, their natural area of competitive advantage.copyright"}
