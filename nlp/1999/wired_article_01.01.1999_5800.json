the medium is merely the messenger.raymond scottsoothing sounds for baby: volume i (1 to 6 months) (basta)both fretful tots and adults looking for cool ambient will appreciate this rerelease of compositions scored for raymond scott's home-brewed synthesizers. volume i (pressed by epic in 1963 for use as an electronic pacifier) resembles a hybrid of minimalism and spacey bachelor pad. tracks range from the mellow, upbeat \"lullaby\" to the enervating \"nursery rhyme.\"various artiststhe perfect beats: new york electro hip-hop and underground dance classics 1980-1985, volumes 1-4 (timber/tommy boy)this thoughtfully produced compilation builds a window into the amazing musical cross-pollination cooked up in the most innovative new york clubs of the early '80s. these palaces of the night were where the bubblegum of latin freestyle hits met the stark electronic precision of kraftwerk, the synth-happy stylings of london outfits like yaz, and the timeless funk of james brown. the perfect beats maps the emotions with songs that emerged as benchmarks on the musical landscape, as well as unearthed gems that serve as veritable blueprints for genres that emerged later.marianne faithfulla perfect stranger: the island anthology (island)in 1964, marianne faithfull, a blond, wispy pop innocent, scored an international hit with \"as tears go by.\" beneath her model-pretty good looks, however, beat the heart of an addict. two years later, her recording career was washed up, and she was on her way to becoming the hallucinogenic junkie of the song.faithfull's return to recording in 1979 was less an unlikely comeback than a complete rebirth. half beat poet and half cabaret chanteuse, she had metamorphosed into a testifying prophet of hypnotic power. this collection recounts the best songs from 1979 to 1995. while several pack a harder punch in concert renditions, this remains a remarkable look at the grimy underside of the '60s dream.the jon spencer blues explosionacme (matador/capitol)six years after its d\u00e9but album, the jon spencer blues explosion continues to exude the sexy charm that keeps this outfit - more an amalgam of hip hop, soul, r&b, punk, and rock than straight blues - engaging. creations like \"attack,\" which serves as an apt theme song, and the smoldering \"lovin' machine\" ensure that this acme product maintains a distinctive vision.street credeasy (web) accessthe robotmakerthe many faces of disgustnew media, old theoriesit's a droid's worldthin is inthe truth is out therememorabilia lanemusiccrowd controlprometheus hardboundcome on feel the noiseone visionary dayreadmestate of fluxmeat spacecontributors"}
