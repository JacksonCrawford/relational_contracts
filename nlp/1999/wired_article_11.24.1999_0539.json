even though these products may exceed federal standards defining hazardous waste, the state of california is proposing new rules that would legalize the current practice of allowing these toxics to be mixed into fertilizers, said dr. bill liebhart, a soil scientist in the agronomy and range science department at the university of california at davis.state data analyzed by california public interest research group (calpirg) and environmental working group (ewg) show that more than one-sixth of the commercial fertilizers tested by the state from 1994 to 1998 exceeded federal hazardous waste thresholds.a new report by the two environment groups -- \"as you sow: toxic waste in california farm and home fertilizers\" -- shows \"fertilizer manufacturers are using california gardens and farms as dumping grounds for toxic waste,\" calpirg toxics director jonathan kaplan said.each year, us fertilizer manufacturers buy tons of waste from industrial facilities such as steel mills and smelters to obtain low-cost plant nutrients such as zinc or iron, the environmental groups say. industrial waste is often heavily contaminated with toxic chemicals.copyright environment news service (ens)

materials -- could be components of the zinc-bearing waste mixed into fertilizers. these chemicals are known to cause cancer and reproductive and developmental problems.laboratory tests of ironite, a popular home fertilizer, showed every sample was contaminated with lead and arsenic at two to four times the federal hazardous waste threshold, the groups claim.officials from the fertilizer's manufacturer, ironite products company, denied the environmental groups' allegations and said misunderstandings are creating scare tactics. ironite is a \"natural soil supplement and fertilizer not manufactured from any toxic waste product but rather from naturally occurring rock containing minerals,\" a company official said.\"according to the united states environmental protection agency and state of washington ... testing methods in which the prescribed maximum dose of ironite was fed to laboratory rats, ironite is not considered toxic if accidentally ingested. in fact, ironite was found safer than common table salt,\" the company saidbut the two environmental groups are not convinced. \"last year, washington state health officials warned consumers that ingestion of less than half a teaspoon of ironite could be toxic to small children,\" group officials said.calpirg and ewg are urging california retailers to stop selling ironite until the state requires that the package carry a health warning. \"we see no justification for allowing products like ironite on the market,\" ewg california director bill walker said. \"at the very least, the label should inform consumers that the product contains high levels of persistent toxins.\"the whole controversy is based on misunderstanding, company officials say. ironite contains small amounts of two naturally occurring minerals -- galena and arsenopyrite -- that can't harm humans when used in fertilizer.galena is a combination of lead and sulfur molecules fused together by millions of years of heat and pressure. arsenopyrite is a combination of arsenic, iron and sulfur, also fused together by millions of years of heat and pressure.\"the lead in galena and the arsenic in arsenopyrite are chemically bonded within the minerals, rendering these elements unavailable for uptake by plants and humans,\" said paul bergstrom of knight piesold, a denver environmental consulting firm cited by ironite.\"the results of our risk assessment report found that prolonged use of ironite does not represent a health risk to residents when applied as recommended on the label,\" said will humble of the arizona department of health services, office of environmental health.countered uc-davis' liebhart: \"if this material went into a landfill, it would have to be treated as hazardous waste.\"the california department of food and agriculture is proposing a new set of guidelines to deal with toxic wastes in fertilizers. but liebhart said, \"my sense is that they are so liberal it allows the practice now going on to continue. there should have been research done on this material before it was ever spread on land. this was never done.\"i can't prove this causes problems [but] no one can prove it doesn't,\" liebhart added. \"we know that contaminants in waste-derived fertilizers can get into the food chain. guessing the highest 'safe level' for these contaminants is a risky business - and if we're wrong, it may not be possible to clean up contaminated farm fields.\"\"there are reputable good products out there, but people cannot tell which ones they are,\" the soil scientist said."}
