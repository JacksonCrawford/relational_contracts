(but) ... i would be the first to say we don't know yet. when we get the sequence done we won't have to have these arguments.\"incyte is one of several companies hoping to make money on its maps of the human genome -- the collection of all human genetic material.they are both competing with and using information from the public efforts, including the human genome project, a collegial undertaking by scientists around the world that has as its aim making the data public to everyone for free.the public project and the private companies are also taking different approaches in how they look at the genes. the human genome project looks at dna.incyte, on the other hand, is looking at rna. this is the business end of dna -- the part that makes a protein. the idea is to find genes that actually do something.\"they are called expressed sequence tags,\" scott said. \"we have been accumulating a database of these and working on confirming the sequences and identifying how many genes are in that sequence database.\"but collins says there is a weakness in this approach, which is being used by other companies using genome information to try and make drugs.\"the trick here is how do you count genes using this strategy?\" he asked.\"you are going to encounter this same gene over and over again if you don't recognize the sequence. these are not complete copies -- they are usually pretty fragmented.\"genes are made up of \"bases\", and there are only four of them, known by their first initials a, c, g, and t. the sequence, or code, is the order in which these four bases link up in pairs.\"if you have a piece from one end and one piece from the far end and one piece from the middle, you might not recognize that they are from the same gene -- you might count them as three genes,\" collins said.he thinks the human genome project's method will end up being more accurate, and predicts a \"final, complete, and highly accurate sequence\" by 2002.the idea behind having a map of the human genome is to better understand disease. for instance, many genes have been identified as having a role in cancer, but many more remain undiscovered.scientists also want to understand how one person's genes vary from another's, and how that makes each susceptible to disease. these differences are known as single nucleotide polymorphisms, snps for short.\"a lot of the work with our dna sequences is very applicable to the discovery of snps,\" scott said.scott made his announcement to a meeting of the international genome sequencing and analysis conference in miami, sponsored by the institute for genomics research.the nonprofit institute was one of the founding organizations in the human genome project, but has since hooked up with connecticut-based perkin-elmer corp. to try to get work done faster.and its former head, craig venter, now leads perkin-elmer's gene-counting spinoff, celera genomics, which competes directly with incyte.copyright"}
