across the country are trying to put the brakes on the juggernaut of online learning. while politicians, college administrators, and businesses scramble to get on the distance learning bandwagon, the instructors who will have to teach these cyber courses remain skeptical about the value of a virtual degree.wired news goes back to school- - - - - -on various campuses, including university of california at los angeles, university of washington, york university in toronto, and the university of chicago, faculty have banded together to protest plans to invest heavily in online education.last year, nearly 900 professors at the university of washington at seattle signed a petition to washington governor gary locke attacking the initial recommendations of the 2020 commission, which was established to explore the future of digital education.they claimed the commission's initial findings, which pushed for online undergraduate degrees, was motivated by shortsighted cost-cutting strategies that aimed to make a quick buck at the expense of the students.\"they wanted to move away from brick-and-mortar education and toward money-saving strategies like digital education,\" said james gregory, one of the professors who coordinated the revolt.\"but the problem with this educational system is that 18- and 19-year-olds will not have the benefit of an on-campus experience. someone on the commission said 'it will be delivered to their kitchen table.'\"the biggest criticism of online learning is that it ignores the social dimension of learning.\"it eliminates human contact, including contact with professors and other students. the peer community is the most important aspect of learning,\" said gregory.\"we are mainly concerned about the students,\" said mary burgan, general secretary of the american association university professors.the concept of virtual degrees is motivated by \"certification, rather than education,\" she said, churning out skilled workers rather than educated scholars.\"[distance learning advocates] use words like 'educational delivery' and 'educational download' as though education is a pipe pumping knowledge into receptacles. that's complete nonsense,\" said gregory. \"the problem is that they confuse information delivery with education. information delivery is reading an encyclopedia, and that's not learning.\"but most distance learning programs today target working adults, not undergraduates, and focus on professional development courses, which offer certification rather than degrees.the western governor's university, for example, offers competency-based courses rather than classes for credit. the institution plans to grow primarily through agreements with companies looking for corporate training for its employees, said amy carmer, manager of public policy at wgu.but the move to dip into pockets of adult learners, with or without corporate support, worries some in the academy.\"people wish to make money off the backs of adults. it's sheer opportunism,\" says carole fungaroli, an english professor at georgetown university, and author of an upcoming book on adult education.\"adults usually have the money behind them. they don't ask for aid and sometimes have corporate sponsorship. it becomes a way for universities to dip into corporate pocketbooks, and take care of the bottom-line.\"and with prestigious ivy league schools and small private colleges moving in the same direction, academics fear that virtual degrees will become a way to cash in on a big name.\"what online learners will get is an asterisked degree, which is different from the on-campus degree. universities will set up a separate but equal campus for single mothers and working adults, while they still have 'a' degrees for their stars,\" said fungaroli.but john preis, associate dean at columbia university's business school, feels prestige schools will \"protect their name and notoriety at all costs.\"\"the quality will be equal if the university fully stands behind the programs it offers,\" he said.but the field of distance learning will not be dominated by flagship schools.\"a lot of the players are going to be community colleges and state schools\" who are committed to access rather than profit, said clifford lynch, executive director of the coalition for networked information, a consortium that promotes the use of technology in education.most state universities have moved toward expanding distance learning as a means to cut costs. in a climate characterized by growing enrollment and financial constraints, online education is seen as a cheaper and more pragmatic way to offer wider access.\"in a perfect world, it would be great to send everyone off to residential campuses, but it's just not possible for everyone,\" said lynch.but professors like michael berube at university of illinois worry that higher education in the united states may begin to look more like the healthcare system.\"you'll have fabulous facilities for the top 10 percent, shunting the education of poorer folks to lower tiers of the system,\" said berube.gregory shares berube's concern that there is an underlying elitist dimension to the \"greater access argument\" for online education.\"the folks [on locke's commission] never envisioned their kids getting this kind of education.\" in their minds, online education is great for kids who could not otherwise afford to go to school, he said.\"but their kids will be in ivy league campuses.\""}
