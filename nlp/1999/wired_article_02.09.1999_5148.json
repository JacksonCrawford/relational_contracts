(nws) shed 31 cents to $29.13 as rupert murdoch placed his oldest son, lachlan, in charge of the company's us publishing operations. the 27-year-old scion is being groomed to one day replace his old man as head of one of the world's largest media empires.in tech, intel (intc) declined $3.63 to $128.38 after chief financial officer andy bryant said more price cuts probably will be forthcoming as the company slugs it out with advanced micro devices (amd) for dominance of low-end chip sales. for its part, amd was down 25 cents at $16.88."}
