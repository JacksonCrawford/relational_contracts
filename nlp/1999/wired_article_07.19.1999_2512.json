i am very worried that they won't be able to at all.\"\"the next six to 12 months are going to be extremely telling in this whole field,\" he said.now 52, venter's own career included a stint in the public sector at a us federal agency, the us national institutes of health.he went on to found a research institute, the institute for genomic research before joining celera last year.a scientist good at businesssome call him a rarity: a scientist good at business.\"i have a great admiration for him, because i think he is a brilliant scientist who has turned out to be a pretty sharp businessman as well,\" said john sime, chief executive of the bioindustry association in britain.venter said celera's goal is to provide information \"first to pharmaceutical companies and universities, then to physicians and individuals on a very broad scale.\" it sees much of its revenues coming from subscriptions to data bases it is building.venter says his research holds tremendous promise: \"what celera is going to do will probably upset even more people, because i want to empower individuals\" by giving them access to genetic information, he said.huge implicationsapart from the business implications, such information has huge social and legal implications.companies involved in mapping genes are usually perceived as being on the cutting edge of biotech. but venter calls celera \"a new hybrid, a combination between high tech and biotech.\"it uses equipment produced by sister company pe biosystems. celera and pe were recently listed as separate companies by pe corporation, formerly perkin elmer.it also has a deal with compaq computer corp.celera's first project since setting up last year is to decode the fruit fly genome, whose dna sequence resembles that of humans. the effort is a collaboration with research groups within the berkeley drosophila genome project.celera also plans to sequence rice and mouse genomes. with respect to rice, venter said there could be \"substantial announcements\" soon on an agreement with a major partner. it already has agreements with some major pharmaceutical firms.in the meantime, celera has filed a large number of provisional patent applications. venter describes such efforts as \"just part of the information paradigm. it would be nuts to see major discoveries ... and just watch them float by.\"copyright"}
