they were throwing a party. rather, they were throwing shares of a couple of net-related ipos back and forth.ivillage (ivil), the online women's network, skyrocketed 234 percent to $80.13 after debuting with 3.65 million shares initially priced at $24 a piece. and cheap tickets (ctix), a purveyor of discount airline tickets, vaulted 108 percent to $31.25 after arriving with 3.5 million shares starting at $15 each.vlsi technology (vlsi) advanced 56 cents to $19.50 after rejecting an unsolicited $777 million takeover bid by royal philips electronics. but the chipmaker's board said it would entertain higher offers either from philips or other \"interested parties.\"at&t (t), meanwhile, fell $2.63 to $79.50 following a japanese newspaper report that the firm is teaming with british telecommunications to purchase a 30 percent stake in japan telecom, the country's fourth-largest phone company. could be possible, seeing as tokyo has made real strides in deregulating its telecom industry, but no one's as yet on the record confirming that talks are even underway.cox communications (cox) was $1.88 higher at $78.94 as it announced a two-for-one stock split. last month, the cable giant reported a 13 percent hike in quarterly revenue to $486.7 million.general electric (ge) climbed $2 to $112 after lehman brothers raised its price target for america's second most valuable corporation (after microsoft, that is). analyst robert cornell said he expects ge's share price to reach $130 within a year, and should keep logging above-average growth \"as far as the eye can see.\"here's a bunch of news for the kids. we'll start with hot topic (hott), a retailer of t-shirts, accessories, and other teen necessities, accelerating 35 percent to $17.19 after beating estimates with a quarterly profit of 79 cents a share. then there's spelling entertainment group (sp), producer of quality tv fare like melrose place and beverly hills 90210, gaining 33 percent to $9 as viacom entertainment offered $162 million for the 20 percent of the firm it doesn't own.and finally, it's good old mattel (mat), falling 50 cents to $24.56 after paying an undisclosed sum for purple moon, the maker of girls' software that folded its tent last month. barbie thus will be joined by her more computer-savvy counterpart, rockett movado.should be a good fit. \"no, no, barbie. it's only called a mouse....\""}
