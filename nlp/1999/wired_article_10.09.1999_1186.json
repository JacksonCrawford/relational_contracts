do they have a clue about the technology they're beginning to regulate? will they do the right thing when it comes to privacy, free speech, and intellectual property online? welcome to the detritus of my dc notebook. ____gop offline: republican web sites suck. that's according to no less an authority than house republican conference chairman j.c. watts, jr.in a letter sent to other house gop members friday, watts takes his colleagues to task for having infrequently updated and -- let's be honest -- pretty useless sites.\"are floor statements, speeches, letters, and press releases updated daily? do you have an electronic newsletter or email updates for your constituents? does the site include links to important republican and news web sites?\"he cites a study from campaignadvantage, a democratic consulting firm based in bethesda, maryland, that says gop candidates for senate seats are making better use of technology than their rivals, but neither party has much of a clue.internet sex: she's a famous 1970s porn star, a 5-foot-9 brunette, and veteran publisher of high society magazine. pornlegends.com raves that she's a \"legend's legend.\"but gloria leonard also wants to keep the internet free from meddlesome morality mavens. leonard showed up at the national press club on friday for a \"sex on the internet\" panel. also speaking was donna rice hughes, best known for her work last decade as a no excuses jeans model and gary hart's winsome flame.hughes is now a spokeswoman for enough is enough, a virginia anti-porn group that has lobbied for the communications decency act and its successor -- an equally unconstitutional piece of legislation that a federal district court early this year rightfully consigned to the dustbin of history.privacy hypocrite: larry summers is not just us secretary of the treasury -- he's a privacy hypocrite.summers said in a speech on tuesday that americans don't expect \"a bank processing a check to record, store, and evaluate their personal behavior,\" and suggests he'd like to prohibit banks from doing so. fair enough. but the reality is that current law and regulations require banks to extensively monitor customers and turn over that info to the feds.a massive government database administered by the irs' detroit computing center receives and records these reports.and what does the treasury department think of that? here's a hint: this summer it opposed a plan to eliminate the ongoing surveillance.now, there may be some very good reasons for those intrusive and privacy-robbing regulations, but anyone who's supporting them should at least be up front about it. hypocrisy stinks.juvenile injustice: no, it doesn't have anything to do with crime. but the so-called juvenile justice bill that both the senate and house have approved, nevertheless has a lot to do with the net.one section in the senate bill requires all internet service providers to provide free or low-cost filtering software to new residential customers.also: \"the office of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention of the department of justice and the federal trade commission shall jointly conduct surveys of the extent to which internet service providers are providing computer software or systems ... to their subscribers.\"another, unrelated portion makes it a crime to advertise firearms \"by computer,\" while knowing that the sale would be illegal. violations are punished with federal prison sentences from one year to 20 years. ouch.but the part that worries free speech advocates and civil liberties groups is only in the house version of the bill. it requires schools and libraries getting \"e-rate\" cash from the feds to shield sexually explicit material from the eyes of anyone not old enough to vote.of course librarians have thrown a fit, claiming first amendment violations, freedom to access information, and so on.you know what? they're probably right.but they should be blaming themselves. they pressed hard for the multibillion dollar phone tax to fund the federal e-rate program, and their lobbyists should have known that congress simply loves to place conditions on money it collects and then doles out to the states.remember highway funds, speed limits, and drinking ages? one bill proposed in the last congress even said that federally funded networks only could use encryption devices easily snoopable by the feds.by now librarians should recognize reality: you can't trust congress anywhere near the first amendment.notable mentions: states and local governments are in a tizzy over sen. john mccain's (r-ariz) proposal that would restrict internet sales taxes and tariffs. they say they could lose up to one-third of their revenue by 2004 ... rick white, former gop congressman from the seattle suburbs, is running for the board of icann. at&t's marilyn cade on thursday sent out a bulk email message to like-minded folks, saying \"at&t and other commercial companies also support his candidacy, and your help is needed immediately.\" ... the ninth circuit court of appeals has set a date to hear the justice department's appeal in an encryption lawsuit brought by math professor daniel bernstein. the full appeals court will hear arguments on 16 december at 1 p.m. in san francisco ... presidential candidates have raised us$1,236,000 on the internet through the end of last month, according to a study released thursday by politicsonline. democrat bill bradley raised the most through the net: $650,000."}
