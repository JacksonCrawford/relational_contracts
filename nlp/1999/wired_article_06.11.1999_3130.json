'too many clues get left behind,' he said. and he's correct.\"virus writers are learning to fear the consequences of their code. beyond criminal charges, a program that unleashes destruction upon a corporation's computer files can easily become a civil lawsuit.\"a lot of [virus authors] don't have the resources to handle this kind of trial \u2013 so they can really be up a creek,\" said smith.still, whoever wrote winexplorezip may feel safe behind a wall of obtuse instructions that offer few identifying clues. bill orvis, a security specialist for the department of energy's computer incident advisory capability, said he's examined winexplorezip code line by line and he has come up empty-handed.\"there's not too much in it that could point you at who actually did it,\" said orvis. but he agreed that the delphi language connection is a means of narrowing the hunt.paul hoffman, executive director of the internet mail consortium, said that simply tracing the worm's email path to its point of origin \u2013 apparently in israel \u2013 would be a daunting task.\"you would have to find the first set of people who got it and track it back to the individual who sent it to them,\" said hoffman. \"and the sender's address is most likely bogus.\" nothing in the headers of the copy of the virus hoffman received contains anything telling.\"it seems much less likely they'll find the creator in this case.\"meanwhile, orvis said that damage reports by midday friday were remarkable.\"the reports i'm getting is that [damage at] the sites it is hitting [is] severe.\"orvis said winexplorezip is not spreading nearly as quickly as melissa did, but \"when it hits, it hits bad.\"\"it's wiping out so many files on people's systems. and if it does that to a whole office full of computers ... it's going to be some time before they can get everything working again.\"orvis wouldn't identify the companies that had reported to the ciac, or how many.related wired links:time-bomb virus explodes on pcs26.apr.99melissa was but a sniffle22.apr.99'melissa' police work lauded2.apr.99.melissa, spawned by spam30.mar.99fbi warns of melissa virus29.mar.99don't mess with 'melissa'29.mar.99"}
