instead, you have to slog through messages in sequence and scramble to write numbers down correctly. microsoft's 900-mhz cordless phone lets you keep an almost unlimited store of voicemail on your hard drive and uses caller id to show the names and numbers associated with each. the base station connects to a pc, making use of your gui to set up call-screening functions and its spare processing power to do voice recognition. your computer can announce the names of callers or dial people on your contact list automatically at your command. of course, if your pc isn't running, this supercharged dialer turns into a plain ol' cordless number. cordless phone system: $199.95. microsoft: www.microsoft.com/phone/.__ kiddie cars __the latest hot wheels are more than die-cast metal with decals. cyber racers incorporate a readable lcd and an onboard computer, so while you still have to use elbow grease to get rolling, the circuit's engines are always in high gear. build a track across the kitchen floor and the dragster's little brain will give you a start countdown, calculate your reaction time out of the gate, and report top speed. a pit-stop alert tests your choice of the right tool when the car needs servicing. one of its features even trumps the full-size volvo s80: a reset button for when all else fails. hot wheels cyber racers: $13.95 each. mattel: (800) 524 8697.__ screen envy __not only does silicon graphics's flat-panel display turn heads, it also comes relatively cheap for a status symbol. sure, the 1600sw costs more than your average crt monitor, but it's the sharpest lcd available - with a resolution of 1,600 by 1,024. it's also wide enough to show two letter-size pages side by side. the included graphics card from high-end chipsmith number nine carries 32 mbytes of memory and uses a 128-bit bus around the board. while the wide-screen is sure to glorify the cad mock-ups on expensive sgi workstations, mac and pc users can buy it and gloat, too. 1600sw: $2,795. silicon graphics: www.sgi.com/.__ eye in the sky __want to check the snowfall around the old ski shack? using a telephone line and power outlet, fonecam remotely sends digital photos to your computer at home. with a built-in 14.4-baud modem and 4 mbytes of memory, the camera can fire off several photos a minute, and it's a lot less troublesome to rig up than a traditional webcam-pc combination. all you do is install moonlight's software on your home computer or server and - presto! - instant surveillance. fonecam: $399. moonlight: +1 (619) 625 0300, www.fonecam.com/."}
