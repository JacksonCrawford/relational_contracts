(\"the olympic committee asked for precise forecasts,\" recalls treinish, \"but the local weather service office said they couldn't do it.\") its most dramatic test came with the closing ceremony. the ibm team (in collaboration with the national weather service and others) predicted no thunderstorms would soak the celebrants, while other forecasts called for a f\u00eate-flattening downpour. trusting big blue, the organizers went ahead. a storm did arrive, but it never got closer than 10 to 15 miles from the stadium.since deep thunder concentrates on what's happening locally only hours before the weather action happens, it isn't good at making long-range forecasts. for that, meteorologists use more sophisticated atmospheric models - or, like piers corbyn at weather action, sunspots - to foretell weather seasons ahead. but for short-term local forecasts, says treinish, the elaborate 3-d rams models provide \"a greater level of precision and accuracy, compared with what's available for a simulation of the entire country. important features could easily be missed using traditional methods, which simply take too long. in localized forecasts, phenomena are short-lived, but we can refresh with new data every few hours.\"since the atlanta trial, treinish and company have ramped up the system by adding flyover animation and panoramic displays. in may 1997, his team traveled to beijing to help install the only deep thunder system currently running. it monitors the eastern half of china - 2.3 million square miles broken into cells of 38.6 square miles. ibm is now discussing similar projects with several southeast asian governments, which seek shelter from economy-wracking typhoons. \"several nations there rely on other countries' weather services for simulation forecasts,\" treinish says. \"but that means they're stuck with other people's data - and with forecasts that don't focus on their needs.\"the deep thunder setup costs roughly $750,000 - too much for your average yachting enthusiast, but a pittance by corporate standards. potential clients in the us include aviation-related firms and insurance companies, who hope to give agents a jump on settling claims by predicting where natural disasters will strike. and the biggest potential customer, of course, is the us government - federal emergency teams, for example, could save both lives and money with early planning on the deployment of paramedics and material resources, such as blood and medicine.considering the hardware investment, treinish says, it's unlikely the national weather service will employ deep thunder across the country. but ibm has been talking with state and local agencies, for whom the investment makes more sense. if you're lucky enough to be living in a city that buys one of these systems, your local weather forecast might soon sound something like this: \"unless you're going downtown today between 10:20 and noon, leave the umbrella at home. on the south side, make sure to slap on the sun-screen; north siders, swallow some extra zoloft - it's gonna be gray all day. and you west side gardeners, cover your tulips: there's hail coming in at 1:45 this afternoon.\""}
