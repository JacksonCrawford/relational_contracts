it was so rough out there that an internet-related company -- get this -- fell below its issue price on its first trading day.what's the world coming to?after being down more than 100 points, the dow jones industrial average reversed course and rose 69.30 to close at 10955.41. tech stocks were even firmer, with the wired index gaining 6.93 to 642.16, and the nasdaq composite index 49.20 higher at 2534.32. the s&p 500 was up 15.32 at 1347.32.interest rates were very much on people's minds. as bond yields inched higher, thus becoming a more tempting target for liquid funds, the us commerce department reported that factory orders increased by 2 percent in march, well ahead of expectations. this, of course, renewed fears of an overheating economy and the possibility of a rate hike when greenspan & co. gather in a couple of weeks.\"the bond market is getting to a point where yields are 100 basis points above last year,\" said christine callies, chief investment strategist at credit suisse first boston. \"this affects the entire market.\"stocks were getting kicked around, she added, because traders simply lost their stomach for such high valuations, especially among many of the top names in the tech crowd. \"the market's not trying to send any deep message here,\" callies observed. \"this is nothing more than a correction for over-optimism.\"share prices, she said, were due for \"a quick and dirty correction of 10 or 15 percent,\" but \"there's no evidence of a substantial problem.\"aside from the daily bloodlettings, that is.the dow was bolstered by at&t (t), which climbed us$5.38 to $56.94 after walking away the victor in the bidding war for cable operator mediaone group. a last-minute deal will hand rival bidder comcast about 2 million additional customers, while at the same time allowing at&t to emerge as the country's single largest cable concern, if regulators allow.no less interesting, the telco reportedly is chatting up microsoft about a possible collaboration that would place a version of windows in set-top boxes nearly everywhere. again, regulators will take a close look at any such marriage of industry titans, but it's beginning to look like bill gates' early interest in the cable business -- microsoft also owns a big chunk of comcast -- could pay off in spades.mediaone (umg) slipped $1.38 to $76.25 as the dust settled, while comcast (cmcsa) was up 14 percent at $73.31. microsoft (msft) rose 94 cents to $79.national semiconductor (nsm) caught fire after announcing its exit from the pc chip business. \"we will immediately cease slugging it out in the pc processor market, which has been dragging down our financial performance for several quarters,\" said the company's ceo, brian halla. traders applauded the move, boosting nat semi's stock 21 percent to $7.75.of course, the company will take a fourth-quarter charge of as much as $300 million and slash about 550 jobs. but investors are looking further down the road to a greater emphasis on microprocessors for so-called smart appliances. advanced micro devices (amd) benefits from nat semi's departure from the playing field, so its stock rose 69 cents to $17.31. intel (intc) gained $2.38 to $64.a busy day on the ipo front. northpoint communications (npnt), a provider of high-speed net access, surged 68 percent to $40.25 after arriving with 15 million shares initially priced at $24 apiece. but with more internet stocks reaching the market, traders are finally growing choosy about what they want. thus, comps.com (cdot), an online provider of real-estate info, dipped 75 cents below its issue price to $14.25 on its first trading day -- the first company with a dot com in its name to ever suffer such a humiliation.have we really reached the point where a dot com isn't a license to print money? probably not, but comps.com's misstep has surely sent a shiver through other net outfits waiting in the ipo wings.at least they can take heart in silknet software (silk), which more than doubled to $35.13 in its market debut. the company, which makes e-commerce applications, sold 3 million shares starting at $15 each.among slightly more established firms, priceline.com (pcln) gained 13 percent to $151.19 after coming in a penny ahead of estimates with a first-quarter loss of 12 cents a share, excluding charges. the provider of discount airline tickets saw its stock upgraded by bancboston robertson stephens to \"strong buy\" from \"buy.\" search service miningco.com (mine), meanwhile, fell $2.81 to $56 after posting a quarterly loss of 91 cents a share.and what's up with network solutions (nsol)? the web-registration firm dropped $1.31 to $68.19 on word that the us justice department is once again poking into possible antitrust violations. investigators had stopped giving network solutions the once over last year after the company agreed to relinquish its near-monopoly on assigning net addresses. now, apparently, the screws are being turned again to get network solutions to play nice with potential rivals.the company's chairman, michael daniels, called news of the renewed probe \"unfortunate.\" yup.lastly, fox entertainment group (fox) shed 13 cents to $25.88 after meeting the street's expectations with quarterly profit of 1 cent a share. but this was down a whopping 89 percent from a year earlier, so investors were understandably miffed.then again, how often does a cash cow like titanic sail across your bottom line? not even solid winners like the x-files and ally mcbeal could look prosperous compared to a monster like that."}
