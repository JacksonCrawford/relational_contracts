will the case get overturned on appeal? will doj or microsoft try to settle?the one thing no one has a clear bead on \u2013 what happens to microsoft if the case stands and there's no settlement?an opinion sampler:\"i think [bill] gates still thinks he can treat everyone like shit and he'll get his way eventually. i think he just got a big surprise.\" \u2013 james love, director, consumer project on technology.\"these landmark findings-of-fact prove microsoft is one of the most powerful and stifling monopolies of the century, and illegally abused its operating system software in a bid to control the market for internet browsers. its intimidating and abusive tactics have harmed consumers. we're anxious to see the remedies recommended by the court that will ensure that these predatory and monopolistic practices will not recur.\" \u2013 jim barksdale, former ceo, netscape communications\"it was hardly necessary to have a trial. you could have just taken the justice department brief and skipped the trial.... this reads like the decision of a man who came to the trial with an opinion about microsoft.... the final outcome will be reversal on appeal. the way this is written will make it very difficult to have a credible case that will withstand reversal on appeal.\" \u2013 ronald a. cass, dean of boston university law school, part-time consultant for microsoft\"as attention turns to potential remedies, sun believes that: microsoft should be prohibited from buying the distribution channels of the future (e.g. cable and wireless) and from buying rather than inventing technologies. microsoft's unfettered use of a cash hoard created out of monopoly profits is a competition killer; the government needs to foster competition in the software industry by assuring that the technical interfaces of microsoft's monopoly products are open; microsoft must be forbidden from entering into exclusive or preclusive agreements; microsoft must be required to make their pricing policies non-discriminatory and public.\" \u2013 sun microsystems\"these findings don't come as any surprise, but this was the easy part. it still leads to the final question, what do you do with it?\" \u2013 mark ostrau, partner and chair of licensing and commerce at silicon valley law firm fenwick & west\"i think this ups the odds that the doj will settle. before this, the justice department would have a real difficult time settling, because they would have been accused of selling out \u2013 of lacking confidence in their case. this gives them a much stronger position politically, and a stronger position to deal [from], because they can reject a deal they don't like.\" \u2013 mark ostrau\"i'm troubled judge jackson's decision may signal the high-tech industry is open to regulation from the courts. the high-tech industry is responsible for producing 30 percent of our economic growth. the high-tech industry should not be burdened by excessive government regulations. that would be a disaster for our economy and millions of working americans.\" \u2013 us representative tom bliley (r-va)\"the essence of this finding is the declaration that extraordinary success in business is dangerous and must be stopped. it is a notice to all the creators and achievers in this country that condemnation and punishment will be their reward for striving to succeed.\" \u2013 robert w. tracinski, chairman, center for the moral defense of capitalism\"these findings are just one more phase in a lengthy trial that should have never gotten this far. the judge's findings must now be applied to existing antitrust law, which is and always has been squarely on microsoft's side. i tell my students it's not about winning the skirmishes, but winning the war.\" \u2013 paul rothstein, professor at georgetown university law center, microsoft legal consultant\"these findings, and in fact the government's entire case, is a disturbing effort to seize federal regulatory authority over a successful and competitive company under the guise of antitrust enforcement. consumers should be making decisions about which companies and technologies succeed and fail, not government lawyers and judges.\" \u2013 haley barbour, former chair of the national republican committee\"it certainly seems like an early christmas gift for microsoft's competitors, but i think they should hold onto their receipts.... the majority of the it industry and the majority of consumers don't believe in this case.\" \u2013 jonathan zuck, president of act, (association for competitive technology)"}
