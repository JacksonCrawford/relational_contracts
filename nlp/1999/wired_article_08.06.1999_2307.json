the web merchant still hasn't figured out how to turn a profit when it sells a book or a cd. and tv sets, stereos, dvd players, and other consumer electronic goods -\u00ad with their highly complex distribution systems and dante-esque customer service problems (*you* try programming a vcr) -\u00ad make paperbacks and pop songs look like child's play.amazon is already raising questions among industry insiders about its latest venture.for example, consumer electronics -- \"ce\" in industry jargon -- manufacturers often have exclusive deals with certain brick-and-mortar stores to sell their wares in certain regions. when retailers sell outside these boundaries, they put warranties in jeopardy and themselves in hot water with suppliers.ce-giant sony is charging amazon with doing just that. the e-retailer has dozens of sony products for sale. the problem is, amazon isn't authorized to sell them.\"we have no deals currently with electronic commerce companies. they [amazon] are not purchasing products direct from sony. we don't know how they're getting our products,\" says mack araki, director of corporate communication for sony electronics.instead, amazon is either making unsanctioned purchases from third-party distributors -- a legal way of doing business manufacturers can't do much about -- or is accepting \"trans-shipments.\" that's a quasi-questionable practice in which, for example, acme electronics in provo, utah orders 500 camcorders for its store, then sells 200 to amazon.\"it's a common practice in the industry and it is frowned upon,\" says steve smith, editor in chief of industry journal twice. \"the manufacturer might not accept the warranty \u00ad- that's done on a company-by-company basis.\" these are minor transgressions in the ce world. of greater concern is that amazon will undercut real-world stores -\u00ad selling at or below cost, like buy.com and other sites \u00ad- or that the merchant will start dealing in black- or gray-market goods. some competitors are accusing amazon of the latter.\"i've heard reports of amazon goods with the serial numbers stripped,\" says darryl peck, ceo of cyberian outpost, which recently announced its intention to sell consumer electronics online.\"that's not true at all,\" said christopher payne, amazon's general manager for consumer electronics. \"we stand behind all of our products.\"but payne refused to disclose how amazon gets its goods.to avoid these sourcing problems, many other online ce sellers are partnering with \u00ad- or are growing out of -- real-world electronics stores. electronics.net, for example, is a joint venture between cybershop.com and new york regional chain tops appliance city.industry behemoth circuit city now has a web storefront. cyberian outpost is teaming up with new england-based retailer tweeter. \"our warehouse will just be another warehouse in the tweeter system,\" darryl peck said.but brick-and-mortar shops' often-restrictive vendor contracts make it extremely difficult for a single merchant to offer a complete selection. so e-town, the 40-person, 3-year-old consumer electronics destination founded by former gadget journalists, relies on a number of retailers to fill orders, including spokane, washington mail-order shop one call and chicago merchant united audio.in the new version of the site, debuting this week, e-town visitors select a product and the store from which they'll buy it. e-town gets a commission for brokering the sale.amazon takes a more streamlined approach. every ce product is shipped first to its warehouse. there's a $99 flat fee to ship and unpack large items. the company will answer basic troubleshooting questions, but, after that, customers have to contact the ce maker directly.\"they're not planning on taking more than 'how do i plug the vcr in?' calls. but they'll get them anyway. and people are going to be frustrated if they can't get an answer. plus, there's no place to take products for service and repair,\" forrester's seema williams said."}
