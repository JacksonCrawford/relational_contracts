(nokia will port the palm os to the arm processor, the chip widely used in european cell phones, communicators, and handhelds, it was announced last week.)kessler replied that most of the world's mobile phones are based on the arm chip.bercow added: \"if you want to play in the [mobile phone] space, if you want to drive the convergence of voice and data, the decision's made.\"later, when the arm issue came up again, bercow said palm is building kernel and processor independence into the palm os, allowing it to run on a range of different processors and devices. a move, kessler said, that would boost licensing of the palm os to hardware manufacturers.asked if palm was going to beef up the processing power of its devices, connell said it wasn't a priority compared to boosting wireless performance or adding usb compatibility.\"there are not too many things pushing the limits of the processor right now,\" he said.wn: why is there a focus on the enterprise this year?kessler said palms are flooding into companies like never before. instead of employees taking their palm to work, companies are starting to buy the devices to give to employees as a work tool.\"ceos are getting it,\" kessler said. \"they understand ... that these products can change the world.\"kessler noted that almost two-thirds of palm's 23,000 software developers are now focusing on the enterprise market, a shift that prompted palm to release this week its new hotsync server and ethernet cradle, and launch corporate service and support programs.when consumers cropped up again, kessler said the consumer market would be discussed more on thursday.\"today we're talking a lot about the enterprise because it's enterprise tuesday,\" he said. \"we're going to talk big-time about consumers on thursday with jim 'i'm-big-because-i-testified-before-the-federal-government' barksdale.\"wn: when will palm support bluetooth (the emerging standard for wireless voice and data networking.)?bercow said the nokia deal will give him access to the company's bluetooth technology. connell said he will release a bluetooth-compatible palm as soon as he gets the software from bercow.wn: will palm continue to support the mac?connelly said there were a lot of mac enthusiasts at palm and the company would continue to improve its mac offerings, as evidenced by the recent release of new mac software.wn: when will palm support syncing by infrared and usb?connolly said infrared support varied widely among laptop manufacturers and it was really up to them to get their act together. infrared syncing worked fine on ibm's thinkpads. as for usb, most palm users are still on windows 95, he said, which has limited usb capabilities. the company recently shipped its usb adapter kit for windows 98 and the mac, he noted.wn: is handspring (which makes a low-cost palm clone) a threat?kessler said contrary to popular conception handspring doesn't threaten palm's hardware business. just the opposite, he thinks it will ultimately benefit it by helping to expand the overall market for handheld devices.\"it's not one big generic market,\" he said. \"our partners will do the right thing for different segments of the market.\"later, he put it this way: \"it's specifically because i can't be all things to all people that i'm in the licensing business.\"wn: when will the palm vii add pager-like capabilities like notifying users when a message comes in?kessler said it was early days yet and palm was listening to requests like this.wn: will the palm vii support wap wireless browsing standard as well as web clipping?connell said wap was better suited to devices with smaller screens than the palm. bercow added that palm was committed to continue developing web clipping, especially as wireless bandwidth increases."}
