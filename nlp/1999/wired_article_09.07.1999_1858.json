indeed, after 20 years of emphasizing computer arts, organizers of the festival boldly decided to branch out into the area of life science.see also: ars electronica turns 20- - - - - -only in europe would an arts festival dive right into the heart of such thorny issues as the propriety of patenting genes or the inevitability of future parents shopping for offspring like consumers at a coke vending machine (one of the art projects on display).and only in europe would the whole exhilarating, contentious mess come off so well. post-symposium conversations buzzed with the energy and excitement of new ideas, and old ideas freshly updated.even under the weight of such dire topics as the extinction of the species, perspective and humor remained part of the mix as speakers addressed the ars electronica 99 theme, life sciences.europe may trail the united states in many aspects of the technological revolution, especially access to the internet. but europe has considerably more experience with epic historical changes. and that could make it the world leader in the biotechnology revolution.\"what most impresses me is the understanding here that novelty is not necessarily progress,\" said lori andrews, a cloning expert who was one of the star speakers.andrews, a professor at chicago-kent college of law who has worked on the human genome project, has a book out this year, the clone age: adventures in the new world of reproductive technology.\"in the united states, we have the idea that the market is the best distributor of a commodity, even values, so we can't have really rich conversations about values,\" andrews said. \"it's different in europe. in part it's a difference in how quality of life is defined. it may not be defined in europe as having more toys.\"sparks have flown at previous ars electronica festivals in linz, a picturesque little burg on the danube river. last year, the theme was infowar, and there was just that.and the split between biotechnology enthusiasts and their opponents made for sizzling confrontations at this year's conference -- of ideas and among individuals.in a lecture sunday, dean hamer, a national institute of health gene specialist, raised troubling issues about a world in which psychiatrists routinely map dna for inclinations for depression or other treatable conditions. \"within a few years, i suggest that the doctor will take a little blood, or maybe a nose hair, and come back with a dna analysis,\" he said. \"if your doctor can get this information, what's to stop your insurance company from getting this information? or your potential employer?\"hamer was in the crowd later for jeremy rifkin's crowd-pleasing speech, which offered a vision of why people need to resist the march forward in the application of biotechnology.described by wired magazine last year as \"the global village's town crier,\" rifkin reiterated many of the arguments presented in his 14th book, the biotech century: harnessing the gene and remaking the world.according to rifkin, the issue of genetic rights will loom over the biotech century like civil and human rights did in the 20th century.rifkin talked about genes as the crucial natural resource of the 21st century. he assured the young people in the crowd that they would live to see \"gene wars.\" he talked about the possibility of extinction of our species if genetic engineering weakens the gene pool. and he warned against turning genetic engineering into an accepted tool of parenthood.it was all too much for hamer, who used the question-and-answer session after rifkin's talk to grab a mike and, voice trembling somewhat, announce: \"i was surprised to find that you are really a closet eugenicist. what gives you the right to say whether i have the right to have a child (free of certain genetically programmed illnesses)?\"rifkin and hamer went at each other after that, trading cutting remarks. rifkin blasted the us scientific establishment for conflict of interest, given the many scientists who sit on corporate boards. he called on hamer to lead the charge against such conflict of interest, vowing to write him a long letter.\"i'll await the letter,\" hamer said, sounding conciliatory.\"and i guarantee you won't follow up on it,\" rifkin said, turning away in a huff. as lori andrews, the one panelist who sat front and center for every talk, put it later: \"it got kind of brutal.\"over against the wall, honor harger of australia was taking in the whole thing and giggling with delight. she came to linz as part of an interactive art project and found the whole biotechnology debate startling new ground.\"it has been a real education for me when you see who the major players are and how they feel about each other,\" she said. \"i just find this really fascinating. it's exciting, and unusual, to see such a high-level exchange of views.\"that was what the event was all about. also during rifkin's time with the mike, someone in the crowd asked for a representative from ars electronica sponsor novartis, a pharmaceutical company, to comment on rifkin's charges of the havoc genetically altered crops can wreak.martin halama, a spokesman for novartis austria, ended up leaning against a wall uneasily, mike in hand.\"new technologies create opportunities, but there are also concerns and it is wise to take these concerns seriously. i don't know if you (in the crowd) are scientists or normal people. i am not a scientist, i am a communicator,\" halama said.\"and not a very good one\" commented someone in the crowd.passions run deep on such issues, which was where the influence of artists came into play.even with tense standoffs such as rifkin's and hamer's, the mood in the auditorium was not oppressive. having artists around can do that for a gathering. they were not just listening, they were turning ideas over in their heads, and maybe planting the seeds for coming projects.\"it has been great,\" said margarita zinets, a video artist who came from kiev, ukraine, for the event.\"i like that artists and scientists are here together to try to find solutions together. i am very interested in such types of communication. i wouldn't say it works for sure, but i think there will be some convergence from the event.\"from my point of view as an artist, some themes were discussed here that will be the basis for new works of art. i think this shows that art can balance science. art has a heart, and when you see a project you know right away if you like it, because you feel it by your intuition.\""}
