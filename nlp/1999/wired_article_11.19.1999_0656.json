(they probably don't have the authority to do it under current law, but paul's thinking seems to be better-safe-than-sorry.)but the richmond fed's top spokeswoman says that goodfriend had been misunderstood.\"it was one of several possibilities discussed in the paper specifically for use only during hypothetical conditions of generally stable or falling prices, declining or stagnant economic growth, and nominal short-term interest rates at or very close to zero,\" marsha shuler, vice president for public affairs, told wired news in a letter.\"mr. goodfriend's purpose in discussing the tax, which has been a topic examined by academic economists for more than 50 years, was to explore mechanisms by which nominal short-term interest rates could be reduced below zero as a means of stimulating economic growth in such an environment....\"before a carry tax could be levied, it would, of course, have to be approved by a majority of both chambers of congress and signed by the president. no one in the federal reserve system is drafting such a legislative proposal....\"the article posted by wirednews should have made that clear. moreover, it should have made clear the conditions under which mr. goodfriend's paper contemplated the use of a carry tax.\"not so fast: last week we reported that the internet's standards-setting body has deep-sixed the idea of building an easy wiretap access for the feds. after all, the show of hands inside the auditorium where the internet engineering task force was meeting was pretty clear, not to mention overwhelming.not so fast, says ietf chairman fred baker, a cisco engineer.he says the debate over wiretapping inside ietf is not over. \"i cannot say that the sense of the room is anywhere near the final answer, although it is surely indicative of the direction we are likely to go,\" baker wrote in an email message.\"we use straw polls to help determine whether a consensus has been reached, but we work on the basis of consensus. yes, in a straw poll, more than 50% of the room said they didn't want the ietf standardizing protocols explicitly designed for wiretap. but there was in no sense a consensus, not even a very rough consensus,\" he said.was this a result of government pressure or simply adherence to ietf's deliberative process? most people seemed willing to give the group the benefit of the doubt, but some were more suspicious. \"it would seem we may have serious politics going on.... something is not right here,\" wrote privacy advocate thomas junker in a post to the ietf mailing list.hitler, stalin, and...? it's no secret that news organizations put polls on their web sites to draw traffic. (typical questions -- guns: good or bad? abortion: good or bad?)but sometimes the polls themselves can be newsworthy.the new york post's online poll conducted last month asked visitors to list the person in the last millennium responsible for the most deviltry. the top 5 include the usual suspects: hitler, stalin, mengele, pol pot, and would normally be noteworthy only for the sheer simplemindedness of the site's visitors. (why not genghis kahn?)but bill and hillary clinton as the millennium's most evil people?according to newyorkpost.com:not bad for two write-ins."}
