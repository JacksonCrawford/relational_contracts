(before cohen spoke, parry opened his own speech with the line, \"i want to give you some sense of why the economic picture is pretty bright.\")cohen's speech was carried live by the cable tv finance channels and numerous wire services. her comments sent legions of reporters running to call their editors.the dow spiked.but cohen's comments did more than move markets, they made modern art.there are dozens of 12-foot windows overlooking downtown san jose in the halls of the fairmont hotel outside the main banquet room. following cohen's speach, every last one framed a person speaking into a cell phone, each one frozen in a different posture, silhouetted against the bright white-gray valley fog outside.in the series of speeches that followed, execs explored themes and variations on the familiar riff about the internet: \"those that embrace new ideas will reap enormous rewards, those that don't....\"other noteworthy moments:larry ellison: his remarks got off to an odd start when a breathless blonde emcee with sunglasses perched on her head introduced him as \"sailor, pilot, ceo, philanthropist: america's adventurer, larry ellison.\" well, he was the only man in the audience of several hundred with a full beard.in any event, ellison covered familiar turf when he thrashed microsoft's vision of a pc-centric future, suggesting instead that heavy servers powered with robust oracle databases will be the center of gravity in the new internet universe. simple net-connected devices with a browser will replace the pc.\"the personal computer will become a peripheral product to the internet, and regardless of the outcome of the antitrust trial in washington, the microsoft monopoly will be broken.\"ellison's other comment of note, designed to illustrate the market for virtual universities built on us curriculum, was an eyebrow raiser. \"by the year 2000, there'll be more english speakers in china than there are in the united states.\"scott mcnealy: sun's boss claimed he swore off microsoft bashing on new year's but broke his resolution when he said he isn't nearly as worried about the y2k bug as he is about the w2k bug (for windows 2000).in the main part, mcnealy echoed the prevailing theme that things are going great in the valley (\"this makes the gold rush look kind of wimpy\") and so focused on steps that business and the government should take to keep from killing the \"goose that laid the golden egg.\"some of the more interesting suggestions tucked in with a familiar litany of big business, less government, lower taxes, more encryption fare: someone, he said, had better come up with some good prophylactic legislation to keep y2k lawsuits from getting out of hand next year.\"if we have a big snow storm next january, people are going to assume it's y2k, and they're gonna sue. we'll be digging out of a legal morass of y2k forever.\"that would be a shame, he said, because the united states has done a pretty good job of preparing for the millennial rollover. asia, on the other hand, could present some thorny problems. asian companies hard hit by the lingering economic slump have scarcely addressed y2k, and that could ultimately affect the many silicon valley computer firms that depend on asia for parts."}
