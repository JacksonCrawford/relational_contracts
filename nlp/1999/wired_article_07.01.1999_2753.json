his voicemail box is regularly filled to capacity with invitations to conferences, lunches, and dinners. and he lives his life at mogul speed. in the past month, he's hosted silicon alley '99, his annual 21/2-day, 2,000-guest new media hobnob; flown to austin for south by southwest, another media megaconference; and jetted back to new york to close an issue of his magazine and tend to his conference-production company, rising tide studios. tomorrow he's off to los angeles to look for conference space for his new west coast publishing venture, digital coast reporter - and, of course, to attend an oscar party.calacanis has a simple explanation for why he's so sought-after. \"i have some star-making power, and it's a big issue how i wield it,\" he says, as if citing a mundane but irrevocable truth. \"in this little pond i'm one of the bigger fish.\"before he became the working-class esther dyson, calacanis was at the other end of the food chain, somewhere between protozoan and guppy, working as a systems schlub at sony music. from there he found his way into the dysfunctional subculture of silicon alley and became a zealot for the idea that content - once the most maligned concept in the economics of the internet - would matter. and if content came to be in demand, he realized, then a number of the slacker web designers in the alley stood to get extremely rich.calacanis used his manic energy - he sleeps maybe five hours a night, has run the new york marathon 11 years in a row, has a fourth-degree black belt in tae kwon do, and doesn't drink alcohol or caffeine - to meet damn near every one of those moguls-to-be. and he started a magazine, the silicon alley reporter - first a shoddy little photocopied newsletter, now a moderately less shoddy glossy with a daily email component and a lucrative conference business - to chronicle and glorify their rise.\"jason created silicon alley as a concept,\" says jeff dachis, president and ceo of razorfish, an alley firm that went public in april.in recent months, with the stratospherically successful public offerings of silicon alley and digital coast companies like earthweb, doubleclick, ivillage, and theglobe.com, and with the $3.5 billion sale of geocities, a lot of those aspiring moguls have become actual moguls.calacanis, for all his boosterism, isn't one of them, and for now his net worth is more about cachet than cash flow. there are perpetual rumors that media companies like ziff-davis have offered a few million dollars for his magazine - chump change, by alley standards. as he anticipates some great future payoff, calacanis says he's not selling and that he's turned down \"tons of consulting money\" and lucrative equity deals in order to chart his own course.wealth aside, everyone in the alley wants to know who calacanis knows, and vcs and money-starved startup executives alike use him as a human search engine for lucrative deals. it's not just that he's a magazine editor. the silicon alley reporter has become to calacanis what the pole is to a stripper - a means of orienting the show. people come to jason calacanis because he's a connector.\"talking with jason is like talking to a focus group,\" says jerry colonna, a venture capitalist whose flatiron partners has bankrolled successful alley startups like starmedia and thestreet.com and who frequently \"dialogues\" with calacanis about alley companies in hopes of gleaning some useful information. \"i'm not going to ask him about the margins of a company, but i would ask him what's hot.\"all this attention, all this networking, has left calacanis feeling a little, well, grandiose. \"he will in all seriousness compare himself to media moguls, and you laugh and say, 'you got a long way to go before you're barry diller,'\" says colonna. \"if you put na\u00efvet\u00e9 and chutzpah together, that's jason. people tend to love him or hate him.\"after a half-hour of ping-pong, exhaustion and the hypnotic effects of the long volleying session allow calacanis to muse calmly about his status as a new media pop star. \"i have a public persona,\" he says. \"people who've never met me have an opinion about me: 'he's good,' 'he's great,' 'he's terrible.' i can't tell you how many girls have hit on me because they want to meet some ceo.\" he lays his paddle on the table. another irrevocable truth: \"this industry wasn't taken seriously three years ago, and i wasn't taken seriously,\" he says. \"now this industry is taken very seriously, and i'm taken seriously.\"__ \"if you put na\u00efvet\u00e9 and chutzpah together, that's jason. but he has a long way to go before he's barry diller.\" __enough chatter - calacanis has an empire to run. he hops a cab across town to the silicon alley reporter's union square offices. the place is a mess. fourteen employees sit around a single, central conglomeration of desks; calacanis' desk faces them, like a teacher's. back issues are lying around like spent betting tickets; the floor is booby-trapped by a nest of blue ethernet cables and extension cords. it's not yet 10 a.m., and already calacanis has 174 emails in his in-box. he answers a few of the important ones, makes a couple of calls, checks the stock price of ivillage, which debuted that day, and in a matter of minutes he's headed out to his de facto conference room - the starbucks across the street - to meet a local newspaper reporter.over a steamed milk with almond syrup, calacanis delivers his favorite sermon, which might be called \"the parable of the television.\" it goes like this: in the early days of each new medium, the first wave of prosperity washes over the hardware makers - rca way back when, then computer makers ibm and apple, and, in the age of the internet, cisco et al. eventually the hardware becomes a cheap commodity, and blessed are the content creators - nbc in the old days, silicon alley firms today, and, he predicts, la-based web-video producers in the near future. at this point in the speech, which i end up hearing four times in two days, calacanis takes a gratuitous swipe at silicon valley by pointing out that new york will always be the capital of media no matter how many smarty-pants computer scientists can cram themselves into the san francisco bay area.part of calacanis' shtick has been to berate a short but well-defined list of people he has designated as new media poseurs, and his attacks on them - in editorials and in frequent postings to industry listservs - toe the line between precociousness and downright arrogance. when rick siegel, founder and ceo of online tv, a silicon alley webcasting company, criticized the valuation of broadcast.com on a popular webcasting listserv, calacanis responded that siegel was a \"total idiot.\"\"you're [sic] business is so lame,\" calacanis wrote, \"your sites are so amateurish, that you criticizing broadcast.com, or yahoo!, shows only one thing: just how delusional you are. you are a pariah on the industry only outdone [by burn rate author] michael wolff.\"siegel responds that calacanis is \"an obnoxious kid who doesn't know how to use his power. the people in new york are always happy when i slam him, because they're too afraid. they think he's mr. all-powerful.\"david bohnett, founder of la-based geocities, says, \"for better or worse, calacanis will speak his mind.\"calacanis' plain-spoken bravado - or petulance, depending on one's perspective - has gotten him noticed. in his short time at the helm of the reporter, calacanis has become the younger version of columnists and conference mavens like bob metcalfe and jim cramer, and has won deference from the tech world's elder pundits. john brockman, new york literary agent and ringmaster to the techie stars, says of calacanis, \"he's a young guy who came out of nowhere and lapped everyone. he's very important at 28; by 30 he'll be dangerous.\"typically, calacanis ends his sermon about tv with a line you can take with you: \"content is going to be rewarded, and that's a blessing for new york city.\" by now, the reporter's tape is full, and calacanis races back across the street to his office for a frantic round of phone calls; he needs some guests for his afternoon web television show, and quick.for lunch, calacanis heads to a nearby restaurant - the one he bought $12,000 worth of sushi from for silicon alley '99 - and when he walks in, he's greeted like a messiah. the owners and waiters bow repeatedly and meekly lead him to his table. he approves.__ everyone wants to know who he knows. vcs and money-starved executives use calacanis as a human search engine. __calacanis' friend jaime levy, the ceo of a 10-person alley animation firm called electronic hollywood, thinks her pal could go even further \"if he'd just quit talking about himself.\" that seems unlikely. with barely a prompt, calacanis is deep into the tale of how, growing up in bay ridge, he was on the fast track to being a nobody. his father ran a restaurant-bar called beards and, after that closed, one dubbed beards cafe; calacanis' earliest business transactions entailed depositing the nightly take at the bank on the way to school. as a teen, he was a hard-drinking ne'er-do-well. at 15 he faced expulsion from the local catholic high school, when a teacher intervened and sought a reprieve on the condition that the kid take up martial arts. calacanis quit drinking and cursing and managed not to flunk out.\"it saved my life,\" he says. \"i'm an extreme person. if i did drugs or gambling or alcohol i'd be very dangerous.\"calacanis got his black belt in three years. he teaches tae kwon do twice a week in his loft, and for entertainment at conferences he sometimes chops boards in half with his bare hands. and he still lives a life of samurai-like discipline; his schedule is rigorously planned, and he spends most of his weekend nights in his loft watching movies on his dvd.\"maybe someday i'll lighten up,\" he says unconvincingly.even though he doesn't drink, calacanis learned from his restaurateur father that entertaining means having plenty of booze, so his conferences and loft parties are always well lubricated. he says his father \"was a great host, but he wasn't a great businessman.\" just before calacanis was accepted at fordham university, beards cafe went bust, and he was forced to come up with his own tuition.calacanis majored in psychology, and he worked as a network installer for a local computer company. then he got a job as a systems guy at sony music and soon hit the silicon alley party circuit - sober, of course. he was a regular at cybersuds, the new york new media association's roaming monthly cocktail hour, and at the happening bashes thrown by sonicnet, pseudo.com, and thinking pictures. at that time, there was little sense that the industry would make a lot of people rich; the emerging cyber subculture was populated \"by a lot of losers,\" says calacanis. he didn't feel so great about himself either.\"i don't know all the references, and i don't get all the jokes,\" he says. \"i'm not the literati guy who quotes mcluhan. i'm kind of, like, the average guy.\" when he was feeling down, calacanis would repeat to himself what was then a somewhat radical notion: \"the internet is more about the kid from brooklyn than the kid from mit.\"egalitarian aphorisms notwithstanding, calacanis was still a low-level systems guy at sony. but he was savvy enough to know that the surefire way to get the attention of the emerging silicon alley clique was to write about it. david hershkovits, coeditor and publisher of paper magazine, asked him to write a gossip column about silicon alley, one driven by the simple premise that, as hershkovits said, \"people are always curious to read about themselves.\" under the byline the cybersurfer, calacanis got noticed with a winchellesque scoop: a well-known alley executive learned his girlfriend was having a lesbian affair when he developed a roll of film and found photographs of the women in naughty tableaux. the alley loved it.calacanis took a freelance job programming a virtual environment for america online, for which he claims the company eventually paid a lump sum of $110,000. with that money in hand, he quit sony, ditched his column, and started his magazine. calacanis modeled the publication after trades like the hollywood reporter, and his first issue, though photocopied and riddled with spelling mistakes and typographical errors, carried - beneath the inciting headline microsoft alienates alley - a substantial scoop he came up with about redmond's attitude toward content producers. in october 1996, he dropped copies of the issue off at various alley firms, and the story had legs - it so miffed microsoft that its employees were instructed not to speak with calacanis, and a few weeks later, the new york times cribbed his information for its own version of the story.calacanis built his magazine by doing a lot of business at what pseudo.com's josh harris calls the \"alley bank,\" a place where, he says, \"good people know how to keep their accounts current.\" harris adds that the atmosphere in the alley is \"pretty quid pro quo-y,\" and, indeed, calacanis makes frequent deposits and withdrawals. he sold ads to local firms and, in short order, wrote glowing profiles of the companies and their executives, who were all too happy to go along with the arrangement. after all, no one else was putting them on a magazine cover.\"i thank jason for the kind of coverage we get,\" says razorfish's jeff dachis, the subject of two flattering features. \"i'm also an advertiser. you make the connection.\"reporter staff complain that calacanis spikes negative stories about his cronies, and his critics say the magazine is no more than a promotional brochure for people he likes. the criticism doesn't really bother him.__ \"i thank jason for the kind of coverage we get,\" says razorfish's jeff dachis. \"i'm also an advertiser. you make the connection.\" __\"people say i'm too in the industry to report on it,\" calacanis says. \"i guess that's true.\"calacanis' editorial coup was to recycle the old publishing trope - the list - to great effect. he began publishing an annual \"silicon alley 100\" issue that gleefully and shamelessly turned the tables on the alley clique. it didn't matter that there were not yet 100 people in silicon alley worth listing; the point was that calacanis, once an outsider to the clique, was now not only defining it but also ranking the importance of its members.for a year and a half, calacanis eschewed a salary, living instead on his aol money, and grew the magazine. he started a daily email update on the alley that now has 20,000 subscribers. and his conferences, which once attracted wannabes and no-names, are now attended by people like excite ceo george bell, rapper chuck d, and alley execs who pay $750 for 21/2 days of calacanish colloquia. in january 1998, he took on an investor - gordon gould, a soft-spoken 29-year-old descendant of robber baron jay gould; now calacanis had capital.from his perch at the reporter, calacanis pursued his real talents, schmoozing and connecting people. he introduced jim caccavo, ceo of tickets.com, to geocities founder david bohnett, and they soon cooked up a deal. josh harris from pseudo.com answered a calacanis call and met bo peabody, ceo of tripod, and now the two companies do business together. at one point calacanis even hired the wife of fred wilson, a general partner at flatiron partners, as an advertising director. calacanis speaks of his social life as a sort of metaphysical spreadsheet; when he introduces people who then do business, he says, \"it's added value to the relationship.\"in the afternoon, calacanis passes through the office before rushing downtown to the offices of pseudo.com, where he shoots his live weekly web-video talk show - called, predictably, the silicon alley reporter. for an hour calacanis and three alley denizens discuss burning issues like whether to list one's cell phone as one's home number and how long it will be before our clothes are embedded with computer chips.afterward, calacanis is trekking up broadway with one of his guests, adeo ressi, a tall, affable 27-year-old alley geek and ceo of methodfive.com. ressi has a proposal: why not start up a silicon alley foundation to give money to poor kids? \"i'll put up the first million,\" ressi says enthusiastically. calacanis mumbles something noncommittal, and the two say their good-byes. but calacanis is a little perturbed. the fact is, for all his new media cheerleading, jason calacanis doesn't have a million dollars.this is the peculiar predicament of many in the silicon alley social set: some people have become really rich, while their friends have not, and no one can explain why it happens to some and not to others.\"it's totally heinous,\" says calacanis' friend jaime levy, another nonmillionaire. \"some of my friends are bazillionaires, and others think they should have gotten stock and didn't and are just pissed.\"the phenomenon begets a complicated emotion in calacanis; he's a booster of the alley but feels nostalgic for the days when everyone was struggling. he speaks longingly of hanging out with friends \"before they were ceos,\" when they'd go to an alley spot called live bait for after-work cocktails. \"when the check would come we'd say, 'hey, i had the two iced teas,'\" he says. \"now the check won't even make it to the table.\"calacanis' other complaint is that all the serious people have been frozen into complacency by ipo madness. he says the alley is now \"in a general state of blah,\" and he blames the \"3 to 5 million daytraders at home in their underwear\" for turning the economics of the alley into \"a ponzi scheme.\"\"the only thing that matters now is that you have an ipo and an exit strategy,\" he says. \"i haven't said 'wow' in a long time.\"when calacanis gets down on the world he helped create, he takes solace in other passions: the new york knicks (he has season tickets), bob dylan, his unfinished novel (a \"techno-thriller\"), and, of course, karate. it's now 8:30 in the evening, and his loft is slowly filling with barefoot, white-clad tae kwon do warriors - 35 in all, including his 50-year-old mom, a couple of silicon alley reporter employees, and even some old sony colleagues calacanis turned on to martial arts. the only sounds are emphatic grunts and the thick cotton uniforms snapping like flogging sails, as the students whirl around and chop the air to bits.pretty soon, calacanis will be in front of the crowd, hacking apart whole armies of invisible assailants - and maybe a board or two. he cinches his black belt around his waist and almost instantly looks calmer. he presents a fine portrait of a young man coping with the responsibility of knowing everyone, and he pauses for a moment to reflect on - what else? - himself. \"i was a sorry kid,\" calacanis says, \"and now people look at me like i'm a pundit. people have watched that happen, and some of them are very happy for me.\""}
