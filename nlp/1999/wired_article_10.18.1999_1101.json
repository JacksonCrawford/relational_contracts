[but] conditioning people's access on their ability to pay [for music] is equally as abhorrent,\" griffin said.griffin advocated making music \"feel free\" through some variation on a subscription model. the mp3 compression format is currently the standard for sending audio files over the internet. although easy to use, the file format also facilitates widespread piracy, which is why the recording industry is busy developing its own specification for format with added security.griffin reached back into history to support his point. when the steam engine was first developed, he said, \"the output of cotton rose ... [but] the price plummeted. that is clearly this situation we're in,\" griffin said.\"it is an opportunity to grow the size of the [audience] dramatically,\" a la the broadcast television model, where a seinfeld show feels free but is really paid for through advertising sponsorship.there was also obligatory group-bashing of the recording industry association of america and its secure digital music initiative, a move to create a technology standard for securing music online. \"sdmi was an attempt to take an existing business model and build traffic around it,\" said ken hertz, a music attorney for the likes of alanis morissette and will smith. \"that never works.\"a lone riaa representative was on a panel to defend the industry. \"this is about change ... trying to understand change. sdmi is the first effort toward that,\" said jim fleming, riaa's director of technology.but brian zisk, founder of green witch internet radio, said, \"if you can hear audio, you can make a copy. by the laws of physics, [music] cannot be made uncopyable.\"\"we aren't spending millions to lock down music,\" countered the fleming. \"we're creating the infrastructure for e-commerce.\"but most panelists conceded that the net is introducing new competition to the traditional record business.\"are we dinosaurs?\" asked andrew keen, founder and ceo of audiocafe.com. \"are we going to be swept away by artist media barons?\"traditional artist-rights organizations like ascap and bmi may go the way of the dinosaur because of new digital rights management companies, said reciprocal ceo paul bandrowski.if technology companies can ensure that all artists involved in composition get their rightful buck, \"than what do we need those organizations for?\" he asked.of course, reciprocal happens to make such technology.companies that serve as \"tastemakers\" \u2013 some kind of filter for the flood of the music \u2013 will be valuable in five years, panelists decided. because with the advent of big bandwidth for faster downloading and streaming, \"as the pipe expands, it fills up with crap,\" hertz said.the value of personal data and personalization technology came up several times as a way to get more money out of moving the music business online.but keen asked if that was a little too orwellian. \"technology [could] undermine our individuality\" by telling us what we like, he said.a couple of speakers predicted tivo and replay \u2013 smart vcrs that can be programmed to pull shows by a genre, actor, and other indexes, and store for the user \u2013 will also handle audio.a device that could make streaming music into something permanent is symbolic of how the net is changing music. \"how to pay artists\" in this new digital terrain is a pretty worn-out topic at these conferences, even though solutions remain unclear.but jon kertzer, director of multimedia at paul allen's experience music project, asked the audience to be a little less us-centric. there is not really a good system in place for making sure artists \u2013 especially in third world nations \u2013 get paid directly when their music is recorded and used commercially, he said.\"let's remember there are creative artists around the world,\" he said."}
