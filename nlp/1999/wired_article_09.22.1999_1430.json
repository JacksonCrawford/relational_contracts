- - - -\"severe long- and short-term disruptions to supply chains are likely to occur\" as a result of y2k-related system failures, the panel said in its 288-page final report.\"such disruptions may cause a low-to-moderate downturn in the economy, particularly in industries that depend on foreign suppliers,\" it said. the us economy, a locomotive for the world, has been expanding since march 1991.the committee listed its greatest concerns as china, russia, and italy, plus a handful of us oil suppliers: venezuela, nigeria, saudi arabia, colombia, and kuwait.\"several important us trading partners are severely behind in addressing the y2k problem ... and are not likely to avoid significant disruptions,\" the report said.other countries' y2k-related problems may wash up on us shores \"in the form of recession, lost jobs, or requests for international assistance,\" it said.at issue is the coding glitch that could cause computers to mistake 2000 for 1900 starting on 1 january. unless fixed, this could play havoc with everything from cash machines to telephones to power grids.committee chairman robert bennett, a utah republican, said through a spokesman that he foresaw a \"strong possibility for a slight economic downturn\" worldwide and a \"slight possibility\" of a global recession due to y2k-related disruptions.but john koskinen, president clinton's chief adviser on y2k, said he did not expect the bug to have a \"significant\" impact on the us economy, citing what he called a consensus of forecasters.at worst, y2k-related tangles might shave one- or two-tenths of a percentage point off us economic growth in the first quarter of 2000, koskinen said.the committee, which has held about 30 hearings and heard testimony from more than 150 witnesses, said it had lingering fears about health care, small business, and local government preparedness.in addition, it said local and regional power failures remained a \"distinct possibility\" in some parts of the united states. both koskinen and the chief trade group for electricity suppliers disputed this assessment.all available data suggest any y2k-related failures \"will be highly localized and of short duration,\" said john castagna of the edison electric institute, which represents most major electricity suppliers.the panel also voiced fears about possible \"trap doors\" that could have been crafted secretly into the millions of lines of us computer codes overhauled overseas.it said the drive to fix the code might have opened the door to \"serious long-term risks to the nation's security and information superiority.\"if a \"trap door\" were inserted into key network software, for instance, an adversary could gain access for years without anyone being the wiser, the panel said.\"it is this long-term unnoticeable access that enables key information to be lifted without a trace,\" the report said.the panel said it was unable to determine the scope of likely y2k disruptions.\"nonetheless, disruptions will occur [in the united states] and in some cases those disruptions will be significant,\" it said. \"the international situation will certainly be more tumultuous.\"the panel cited italy as a particular concern, partly because of the throngs expected to converge on the vatican to mark the 2,000th anniversary of the birth of christ.specific areas of worry are water, electric utilities, transportation, airports, and, most of all, y2k preparation of hospital equipment, the report said.the panel faulted an initial series of state department country-by-country y2k summaries as \"rather general, with little to distinguish one country from another.\"the state department summaries were released on 14 september after two sets of government-to-government consultations.the panel said all available assessments indicated a relatively high probability of y2k-related failures in key sectors in former soviet bloc countries. most at risk were telecommunications, transportation, and energy sectors.russia, it said, is likely to experience a month of disruptions in financial markets, two months for utilities and health care, and up to three months of turmoil in transport and communications.china, too, appears to be very poorly prepared, the panel said.\"because of improper planning, insufficient resources and a very late start ... the committee believes that a substantial portion of chinese companies and the government will experience several failures,\" it said.china may also be haunted because as much as 95 percent of its software \"is thought to be pirated,\" the committee said. \"this could prevent chinese companies from receiving technical support from suppliers.\"copyright"}
