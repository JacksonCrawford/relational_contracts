(yup, i measured it.) they were even better on the subway, the noise of which is louder and at a higher frequency. bonus: no sound leaks from these 'phones, since they play deep in the ear canal.there are drawbacks, however. having these things in your ears takes some getting used to; the cord literally conducts audible vibrations to your ears like the string in a tin-can telephone, so it's best to use the supplied inline shirt clip to slacken the connections to each ear. and at $330, er-4s earphones are damn costly by most people's standards. but what other options have you got? there's nothing like starting the workday when the only horns you hear are from the boston symphony - not an orchestra of pissed-off cabbies.er-4s earphones: $330. etymotic research: street credbrother's keepercryptic adventureshave it your wayshout it outkiller opbatman's second lifereality checkrobo scopemusicjust outta betareadmepersonalized checkingdeep knowledge'phone of silencewatts for dinnerthe public face of linuxcontributors"}
