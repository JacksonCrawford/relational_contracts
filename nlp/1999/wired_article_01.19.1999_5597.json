andrikopoulos said it's still too early to test the prevailing winds, but he wouldn't be surprised to see offers from time warner or news corp. he's also looking ahead to disney eventually taking a controlling stake in infoseek.snap unveiled an accord with gte and bell atlantic for the two telcos to offer a high-speed version of its own portal for users with bandwidth to spare. snap's majority owner, cnet (cnet), jumped 37 percent to $99.75. cnet also owns news.com, which competes with wired news.yahoo (yhoo) advanced $6 to $323, and infoseek (seek) was $5.69 higher at $77.06. but marketwatch.com (mktw), which skyrocketed more than 470 percent on its first trading day last friday, fell $1.13 to $96.38.ebay (ebay) was up $6.50 at $229.88. but one of the growing army of rival auction houses, onsale (onsl), lost $8.19 to $50.25 after warning that its fourth-quarter loss may be as high as 17 cents a share. this would only be about a penny more than anticipated by the street, but would nevertheless be perceived as a setback in light of all the attention online auctioneers have received of late.cdnow (cdnw) gained $1.44 to $21.81 after saying its fourth-quarter sales likely will total more than $20 million -- a sizable increase over the $7.9 million seen a year earlier and the almost $14 million logged in the third quarter. the online music retailer is now in the process of merging with rival n2k.microsoft (msft) will post its own quarterly earnings after the closing bell. analysts were \"officially\" looking for the software giant to come through with profit of 59 cents a share, but the unofficial number was at least a few cents higher. microsoft climbed $5.88 to $155.63.international business machines (ibm) rose $6.56 to $191.50 as morgan stanley dean witter reiterated a \"strong buy\" rating for the company's stock. intel (intc) advanced $4 to $139.38, and cisco systems (csco) was $4.69 higher at $106.38.charles schwab (sch) gained $1 to $60.75 after reporting record quarterly profit of 26 cents a share. much of that take came from about 93,000 online trades each and every day, accounting for 61 percent of schwab's trading total.elsewhere in finance, chase manhattan bank (cmb), jp morgan (jpm), merrill lynch (mer), painewebber (pwj) and bear stearns (bsc) each reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, but their stocks were mixed amid uncertain outlooks for overseas economies. bankamerica (bac), meanwhile, fell 56 cents to $64 after its profit came in a couple of pennies shy of the anticipated mark.airtouch communications (ati) rose 11 percent to $92.88 as the ink dried on its $56 billion purchase by britain's vodafone group (vod), which was up $8.50 at $184.50. bell atlantic (bel), the spurned suitor in this particular triangle, managed to walk away with a $4.75 hike in its share price, to $57.88.lastly, is the future of gaming on the net? sony (sne) appears to think so, spinning off a game-design unit into a separate business. the company, redeye interactive, will unveil its first pay-by-subscription online game, everquest, in march.or is this just a sneaky way of getting set to cash in on the boom for internet stocks? whatever else, sony's shares closed $1 higher at $70.06."}
