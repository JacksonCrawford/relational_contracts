is not an earthquake. it's the sound of carefully engineered offensive and defensive linemen moving down the field. by polly sprenger.", "author": "polly sprenger", "category": "science", "type":

bay's defensive line, which averaged a stout 249. it's a little different in 1999. after a year that saw mark mcgwire's mammoth biceps making headlines on a daily basis, super bowl xxxiii will feature a number of offensive and defensive linemen on the bloated side of 300.evolution happens, but in 33 years, the brawn on the line has eclipsed anything darwin envisioned. but experts say it wasn't magic. our beefy bulldozers upped their mass with sports technology, diet, a few unmentionable steroids, and good old-fashioned clean living.norman baker, head of the north american association of sports historians, says football -- more than any other sport -- reflects the improvement in the nation's overall health.\"kids are healthier as a whole because of better nutrition and health care,\" baker said. \"there's a whole lot of reasons why size of athletes in general has increased, but football is a particularly intensive example.\"that's because in football, a rule change to make the game more exciting gave birth to a new breed of linemen.in 1978, the nfl started allowing offensive linemen to extend their elbows beyond the span of the their shoulders, and permitted them to use their hands to block. although the rules were still strict about how they could use their extended arms and hands, it meant linemen could use more brawn and needed less maneuverability against the defensive line.\"up until then, offensive linemen, when pass blocking, had to be very agile and quick on their feet, which limited their size,\" said ralph hickok, webmaster of a sports history site. \"with perhaps a couple of exceptions, the 300-pounders of today simply would not be effective pass blockers under the pre-1978 rules.\"once brawn became desirable, technology and sports science quickly went to work to add weight to the line.\"the care and breeding of football players and other athletes has become an industry,\" said richard crepeau, a sports historian at university of central florida. \"in that first year in college, strength coaches, weight trainers, dieticians, and a number of people armed with the latest knowledge from the science of kineseology -- which barely existed at the time of super bowl i -- and physiology go to work on the human machine.\"crepeau said coaches eagerly await batches of new recruits to see what they can build out of the raw materials.\"with all this science, technology, and pharmacology directed at these young men it would be a great shock and disappointment if they were not much bigger,\" crepeau said.now every team has a strength coach, and most have a dietician who monitors the body fat of every player, knowing exactly what combination of proteins and carbohydrates will produce 300 pounds of nearly solid muscle for each body type.in the old days, beefing up a new recruit meant force-feeding him milkshakes and steak dinners, said jon rochmis, who covered the san francisco 49ers for the oakland tribune from 1985 to 1990. but when the '80s arrived, so did something that meant linemen could keep their size and strength, while regaining some of their pre-1978 nimbleness: steroids.\"i've seen estimates, based on anecdotal evidence, that 80 to 90 percent of nfl linemen were using steroids during the 1980s,\" hickok said.the league conducted drug tests, but they weren't exactly random, rochmis said. since the nfl was usually looking for cocaine and other narcotics, and players often had advance warning of a test, it was easy to mask the presence of steroids.the saying around the league was: you aren't an idiot for taking steroids. you're just an idiot if you get caught.during most of the 1980s, the trend toward bigger bodies on both sides of the line increased.\"the success of the washington redskins under joe gibbs was certainly a major impetus toward bigger lines, on both sides of the ball,\" hickok said. \"the guard and tackles on that unit averaged 290 pounds and included the nfl's first 300-pound offensive lineman, tackle joe jacoby.\"winning three super bowls under gibbs, the redskins demonstrated that gigantic offensive linemen could not only do a good job of pass protection, but they could also take over a game by simply wearing down smaller defensive linemen through repeated pounding.\"gibbs' offensive line of the '80s, nicknamed the hogs, meant other teams had to beef up just to avoid being trampled.but their legacy isn't fully played out. nfl watchers expect linemen to get bigger before they get smaller. in super bowl xxxxiii, we could be watching 500 pounders pulverize each other."}
