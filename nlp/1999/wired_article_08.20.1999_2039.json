news. the mercury news \u2013 which temporarily suspended nolan, cancelled her column, and transferred her to another bureau \u2013 has declined to publish nolan's or any other letter pertaining to the stock trading controversy.also:reporter's change in fortunenet press takes stock of ethicsto the editor: i'd like to respond to two stories and one editor's column that have been written about me in the san jose mercury news. i think the two stories, accounts of my purchase of some \"friends and family\" stock written by reporter brandon bailey, and executive editor david yarnold's column, \"why we take conflicts of interest seriously\" fail to meet the mercury news' standards of fairness and accuracy.all three articles leave out key facts, which would be detrimental to the mercury news. the result is a series of stories that give an unfair and slanted version of my actions that serve the merc and its desire to portray itself as a bastion of moral integrity while diminishing my personal and profession reputation.although the merc would have its readers believe that i have somehow strayed from the path of ethical, professional, and responsible journalistic behavior, that's simply not the case. instead, it's the mercury's management's failure to have an ethics policy in place, its failure to have a mechanism in place to answer and cope with ethical concerns raised by reporters, and the paper's refusal to take responsibility for its oversights that are at fault here.i did exactly what reporters are supposed to do when they're faced with the potential for conflicts of interest or other misunderstandings. i talked to my editor. i told him about the offer to purchase the stock. i told him about my friendship with the company's ceo. i saw no ethical dilemma since i wasn't going to write about the company \u2013 the ceo and i were friends \u2013 and hadn't written about the company. i needed to know if the merc had any concerns. he said he'd get back to me if there was a problem.i have worked with former assistant business editor, now city editor, bert robinson successfully \u2013 breaking four national and a host of local stories \u2013 over the past two years, building up a close rapport and sense of trust. he is as opinionated, outspoken, and fair-minded as any editor i have ever had. i like him very much. because of our unusual rapport \u2013 one that was vital to the success of my column \u2013 we have operated on the understanding that when i tell him of a concern or dilemma, he tells me as quickly as possible what to do. if there's no problem, i don't hear from him. if there is, i do. it's bert's job to go find out what the problems are and contact me if there is one.but in order for the merc to blame me for all the bad things that have happened to its reputation over the past few days, the newspaper is now saying my trust was misplaced. they want readers and others outside the paper to believe that my conversations about my stock purchase weren't substantial, that i just happened to mention the trade in a brief, rushed hallway conversation with bert. the merc is now saying that it is entirely my responsibility to make sure that my editor (as well as my editor's editor) were doing their jobs. that's ridiculous and it's bad news for anyone doing business with the mercury news. because if reporters can't trust editors to help them, they're defenseless. so are the people they cover.as the merc now articulates its policies, nothing is approved until the paper has used 20-20 hindsight to evaluate its impact on the paper's reputation and good name. this is simply wrong. if reporters can't trust and rely on editors, then why should sources trust and rely on reporters?what happened to me illustrates just how profound the failure of leadership and management at the merc is. and we all agree on what happened.so, if the mercury news had an ethics policy in place, how come none of these managers \u2013 the people mr. yarnold counts on to uphold and demonstrate the \"principles that we all learn in journalism 101\" \u2013 mentioned it to me? the document in place when i was \"discovered\" to have bought my stock - \"san jose mercury news: a statement of principles\" \u2013 was written in 1984, gathering dust on a shelf in a remote office and wasn't distributed to me or others on the staff when we joined the paper. and whatever ethics policies the paper claims are in place, the merc hasn't applied them. mr. yarnold acknowledged as much in his 28 july letter to the staff. \"if you think you're not in compliance or if you have any questions, please discuss your concerns with your department head of assistant managing editor,\" he wrote.that's why the merc has backed away from its original accusations against me, the ones based on specific violations of a policy that no one read until 15 july, 1999. now, i'm accused of violating \"basic journalistic ethics.\" even in retreat, the paper is struggling to defend itself. mr. yarnold's idea that journalism is made up of beliefs so profound they can be agreed on without discussion has come under fire from experienced editors at organizations he regards as competitors, like thestreet.com and cbs marketwatch. both these organizations have firm, articulated, ethics policies and their editors have publicly and harshly criticized the mercury's management for its handling of my situation.those criticisms illustrate why the merc should have had a system in place for reporters and editors to deal with ethical questions. when i went looking for a conversation about my stock purchase, no one was interested \u2013 probably because they didn't know how \u2013 in having that conversation.but things changed as soon as the journal piece appeared and the merc did what lots of organizations do when they're criticized, it shifted the blame away from the organization to me, one employee, using its full power as a daily newspaper to decry my behavior and ethics. that's because the merc mistakes scrutiny for condemnation. and while i'm not crazy about the description of my stock purchase that appeared in the wall street journal \u2013 there are several mistakes \u2013 it comes with the territory. rather than fight off people who question what we do, i think the merc should treat outside criticism and attention as what it is: one of the most flattering of backhanded compliments.there are a few other points i'd like to make.as a columnist \u2013 as a gossip columnist who covers both business and social events \u2013 i have a wide latitude on what to cover. as i have said repeatedly, i have not ever covered autoweb because its ceo was a good, long-time friend. i do not write about my friends. writing about people you like is hard. to write about them or their companies is, in my mind, a disservice to readers \u2013 who may not like the person about whom you're writing, maybe even unintentionally defending.it's also worth noting that in its struggle to keep its ethical reputation clean, the mercury news, specifically, mr. yarnold is making some profound changes in how we conduct ourselves. as i've said, he's saying that reporters cannot trust their editor's judgment. he is also interfering in the delicately negotiated relationships that reporters have with their sources.mr. yarnold and the merc would like its readers to believe that my friend, the autoweb.com ceo, is a source \u2013 someone whom i rely on for information \u2013 not a friend. that's inaccurate but it's being done so mercury news editors can say i've violated that part of the \"statement of principles\" that says reporters shouldn't enter into business arrangements with sources.in his attempt to shift blame from his newspaper to me, mr. yarnold himself violates one of those \"time-honored principles\" he wrote about a few weeks ago. since he's said the autoweb ceo is a source, many readers of my column might believe him, particularly since much of my column \u2013 indeed most of the good parts of my column \u2013 has relied heavily on unnamed sources, people to whom i have promised anonymity. i intend to keep my promise to those people. but, to serve his own interests, mr. yarnold has publicly \u2013 and incorrectly \u2013 insisted that my friend is one of my sources. it's not true, and, of all the things that have occurred since this whole episode began, nothing disturbs and distresses me more than to see an editor take it upon himself to name someone he thinks is a reporter's source \u2013 in print \u2013 without consulting the reporter.lastly, i'd like to point out that when it comes to having the moral high ground on ethics, the mercury news and its parent company knight ridder are living in a very big glass house. while the ethics policy applies to editors, no one \u2013 apart from the newspaper guild \u2013 has asked about their investments. and what about other members of management and the company's corporate executives, now local residents?knight-ridder, the newspapers' parent company, has made lots of investments up and down silicon valley. it has a stake in america online, a relic of its very profitable investment in netscape communications. it was an investor in pointcast, the much-publicized \"push\" service that faltered two years ago. not until 28 july did the paper's business section decide to regularly tell people when it writes stories about companies where kr has investments. but the company has an active silicon valley venture fund and venture funds often like to keep their deals private. how will kr's investment activities be covered? is the paper also saying that its corporate parent can invest \u2013 and, one assumes, take advantage of the knowledge that comes from running a local newspaper \u2013 but that individual reporters are barred from the same kind of activity?this has been a particularly difficult month for me. in the course of my more than 15 years as a reporter, i have landed more than my share of punches. and i can take a few. but these last few blows feel like rabbit punches; the hits are from behind and below.chris nolan, san
