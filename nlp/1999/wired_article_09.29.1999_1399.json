[louie] is someone from the product side, not the investment side,\" he said.andrew anker, a partner with august capital, described the project as interesting but misdirected.\"there is a huge glut of money out there,\" anker said. \"and there are a lot of ideas out there. the question is more, 'what does the marketplace want?'\"\"say the cia said that wrist phones are critical for our agents and we will buy 10,000 of them. as long as there is a consumer market for it, a bunch of entrepreneurs will go down to sand hill road and seek financing to get it.\""}
