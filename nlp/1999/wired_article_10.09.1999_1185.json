(keaton has edited two photo books and published one of her own.)\"i never bother the stars, though, so i almost walked away. then i just walked up and asked her if she'd be interested in working on this. a few days later she was here at the library pulling photos out of boxes.\"it took two years worth of sorting through the herald collection of more than 2 million photos to find the ones shown. keaton has also compiled the images into a book, also titled \"local news\" to be published by d.a.p. books.interestingly, many of the photos show evidence of early retouching techniques: a tear added here, eyes darkened there, a scar traced to make it jump from the image. entire people are even airbrushed out of some of the photos. it appears the debate over photo manipulation predates photoshop by decades.in addition to the large exhibit in the upstairs gallery there are two smaller exhibits showing downstairs titled, \"extra! more local news!\" curated by los angeles magazine photo editor lisa thackaberry and los angeles times deputy arts editor susan brenneman.\"extra\" draws from the later years of the herald collection and provides early context of behind the scenes herald express shots. some of the images, such as a devastated downtown los angeles after the los angeles river flood and hillsides covered in smoking oil derricks, remind us of the impermanence of much of our creation. other pictures illustrate the california dream: a working man leaving his wife and kids at a nice bungalow while he goes off to work, surfers waiting for the perfect wave at malibu.the los angeles library has put much of its historical photo collection online including portions of the herald collection.\"we have manson online. we have bugsy siegel online,\" said cole. she said the library tries to post the most popular photos. after the \"local news\" exhibit is taken down it, too, will live on the library's site."}
