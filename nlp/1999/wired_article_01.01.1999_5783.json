remember that most y2k issues were known to developers even as they wrote their flawed code. bright spot: given the stiff consulting rates charged in the 1990s by masters of obsolete programming languages, college kids in 9998 will find an easy way to hustle up tuition - by learning the 8,000-year-old secrets of cobol.must readode to riskimac attackclean slate?jargon watchthe life of the partyburn rate olympics: 1998's iposwho will rock 1999home depot sleeps inboffo box officejoysticking it to the academysneaking past windowshype listgirls! girls! links!face valueinside the first \"internet war\"built for speedpeoplebeen there, done thatthe bugs in your futureare you on the leper list?pandora's boom boxtomorrow todaydead-talent agencyfuture projectionsthe california spammer hammertired/wiredtips from an ex-spam kingraw data"}
