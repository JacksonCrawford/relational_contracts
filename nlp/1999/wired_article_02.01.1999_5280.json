getting a hip replacement that fits is essential. with medmodeler by stratasys, a computer takes cat-scan or x-ray images or mris, converts them into cad format, and then cuts thin plastic sheets, which are stacked to create a custom-made 3-d mock-up of the new hip.www.stratasys.comdress rehearsalendoscopy lets doctors view hard-to-reach places in the body (colon, lungs, stomach). but even the tiniest camera can be blocked by a sharp curve in a passageway. siemens medical systems's 3d virtuoso software pieces together a series of 2-d images to create virtual fly-through tours of a patient's innards.sms.siemens.comwomb with a viewsonosite's 6-pound handheld ultrasound machine lets emts scan a pregnant woman at the scene of an accident for injury to the fetus. since ultrasound images are inscrutable to the untrained eye, sonosite will couple the device with a satellite link to send images to in-hospital ob/gyns for analysis.www.sonosite.comthe last shotaviron's flumist, a nasal spray that delivers a flu vaccine to the upper respiratory tract, spares squeamish patients the needle. another device, being developed by sontra for diabetics, uses 20-khz sound waves to monitor blood-sugar levels without drawing blood.www.aviron.com;
