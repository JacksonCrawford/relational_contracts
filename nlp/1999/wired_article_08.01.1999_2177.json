he is busy writing a book: \"with few interruptions, i hope, for the rest of the year, and my point is that this isn't a colorful, two-person activity.\"yet, if i insist, i can see him at his place in the country. \"you are welcome to ... come visit briefly,\" he writes. the words don't quite convey the sound of a door slamming. yes, it looks closed. but i sense gleick on the other side, his hand on the knob, waiting to see if i will go away.i drive out for the first time in august 1998. gleick and his wife, cynthia crossen, are living full-time in the country now, about an hour north of new york city. the road up to their home is long, winding, and rich with the smell of late-summer leaves. \"climb boldly to the top,\" gleick had instructed. \"stay wide on the turns.\"the house is a stunning frank lloyd wright-inspired sprawl of granite and cedar, perched high above the river in putnam county, a woodsy domain on the hudson's east bank. landscapers are laying sod when i pull up, and gleick's black lab, astro, rises from the lawn. a young swedish woman named frida, an occupational-therapy student who's helping gleick recuperate, pulls open a newly varnished wood-and-glass door.gleick stands in the living room, leaning on crutches. in a picture on his web site you see a strikingly handsome man in his mid-forties, his light brown hair slightly unkempt, his ruggedly planed face brought to life by eyes filled with inquiry. in person his face is softer. he is 6 feet tall and wears a faded brown polo shirt, cotton shorts, and boots. the shorts reveal a prosthetic left leg and a heavily scarred right leg.__ after the accident, the new york media world buzzed: was flying a kit-built plane really the wisest father-son hobby? __gleick limps slowly out to a deck and settles into a lounge chair. he doesn't quite get why i'm here, he begins, why he merits attention \"at this point in time.\"the minor-key grouchiness is no surprise. among colleagues, gleick is widely respected but not exactly beloved. people describe him as everything from \"curt\" to \"machiavellian,\" noting that he can be gruff with people who aren't up to speed intellectually. it's a reputation he's willing to play with. at one point, we talk about freeman dyson, a brilliant physicist whom gleick has written about.\"he seems like a truly sweet person,\" i say.\"he is a sweet person,\" says gleick, smiling at the thought.\"well, heck. you're sweet, too.\"\"no, i'm not,\" he says. \"i'm a complete asshole.\"crossen joins us later for lunch. a longtime wall street journal writer and editor, she is spirited and friendly, telling me how she met gleick his first year out of harvard, in 1977, when he was managing editor at a short-lived alternative newspaper in minneapolis and crossen was a young staffer on her first job. \"i slept with the boss,\" she laughs, fetching food from the refrigerator.with crossen around, gleick relaxes - sort of. at one point, as they swap memories and compliments, he mentions crossen's 1995 book, tainted truth, an examination of how statistics can be used to distort reality.\"this is an excellent book,\" he says, suddenly revved up, declaring that it should be read by every editor in the country. \"it got favorable reviews everyplace except the new york times book review, which assigned it to some stupid moron of a ...\" he stops himself. \"i'm not supposed to criticize anybody.\"crossen stands to leave, her back to a wall of family photographs - parents at a celebratory gathering, jim carrying a child in a backpack. she begins talking about gleick's early days as a staffer at the new york times, when he was writing brief items called \"follow up on the news.\"\"they don't do that section anymore,\" she says, speaking quickly. \"the one i remember was about the people who had been on a northwest flight - one of those deals where a plane dropped 20,000 feet. and they all think they're going to die, and it rights itself and so nobody even gets injured. but it was like 10 seconds of unbelievable terror, and these people said it changed their lives.\"\"i don't remember that one,\" says gleick. \"must have blocked it out. want to go up and see my office?\"on the morning of december 20, 1997, gleick was piloting an experimental airplane when it crashed 60 feet short of the runway at greenwood lake airport in west milford, new jersey. the couple's adopted son, harry, a lively and adventurous 8-year-old who often flew with his father, died shortly after impact. gleick was trapped inside the mangled aircraft for half an hour; as rescue workers started pulling him from the wreckage, he asked about harry and then passed out. gleick lost a leg, nearly lost both, and spent five months in new york university's rusk institute of rehabilitation medicine.gleick had started flying back in the late '80s, when he was a copy editor at the times. working the weekend shift, he had an out-of-sync schedule that allowed him to take midweek lessons. aviation appealed to both the adventurous and technogeek sides of his personality.\"flying was great,\" he says. \"you have to think fast. you have to develop intuition about the physics of air moving quickly over a surface. and i can say, much to my sorrow, that you're using your hands and feet on the controls of this thing, and you feel it. then there's all this other stuff you have to learn, the radio stuff and the navigational stuff.\"gleick had \"this crazy idea to buy a secondhand, home-built airplane,\" so in august 1997 he purchased an 11-year-old long-ez, a $35,000 aircraft put together from a kit. the plane has a composite fiberglass/foam body, a canard wing configuration (with small wings in front and larger lift-producing wings in back), and a rear-mounted engine. the federal aviation administration classifies the long-ez as \"experimental\" - meaning, among other things, that the faa has limited regulatory control over it - but the craft has a reputation for reliability and is often used to gather data for government research.of course, reliability is a relative term with these planes. according to the experimental aircraft association, .76 percent of all amateur-built planes are involved in an accident at some point - everything from a wing catching on a hangar door to a fatality. that's higher than the rate for small private planes and higher still than the rate for commercial airliners.the faa does not oversee the design of experimental planes, but it does inspect every stage of their construction and certifies them for airworthiness. still, these are tricky aircraft. gleick's plane was the same make as the one john denver died in, and like all experimental pilots, gleick was required to affix a placard on his plane that read: passenger warning: this aircraft is amateur built and does not comply with federal safety regulations for aircraft.the cause of the accident is still a mystery. the final report of the national transportation safety board is due this summer, and at press time both mechanical and pilot error remained possibilities. gleick could be exonerated, or, though it's unlikely, he might face criminal charges if it's determined that an act of gross negligence caused the accident.after the crash, some people in the close-knit world of new york media saw no need to wait on reports. the very nature of the episode seemed blameworthy enough, and a fundamental question became the buzz du jour: was flying around in a kit-built plane really the wisest father-son hobby?at harry's memorial service, with gleick still in the hospital attached to a morphine iv, crossen chose to address that head-on, recalling how harry loved to fly, how meticulous jim had been about maintenance, and how, in her mind, risk-taking was integral to enjoying life. as for this risk, she said she and jim \"would live with the consequences of that decision for the rest of our lives.\"for his part, gleick mixed grief and recovery - he literally had to learn to walk again - with a rapid return to work. shortly after the accident, jack rosenthal, then editor in chief of the new york times magazine and perhaps gleick's biggest fan there, phoned crossen to offer his sympathy. she suggested he send gleick an email; in the ensuing weeks and months, gleick communicated electronically with rosenthal, who figured that \"work could be a big part of bringing jim back.\"\"spend five months in a hospital and you find out who your friends are,\" says gleick, recalling people who reached out to him during those dark days. rosenthal made regular visits, and in february 1998 he suggested it was time for gleick to resume his popular monthly technology column, \"fast forward.\" from his hospital room, gleick produced a piece on digital storage, which appeared in april.sometimes he talked to rosenthal about losing concentration, saying that he had \"spent the whole day thinking about harry.\" he also found that a 5- or 10-minute walk produced nearly unbearable pain. still, he welcomed the chance to work.gleick never returned to the family's permanent home in brooklyn heights, where he had written his first two books and, with harry on his lap, played hours of computer games like doom and total annihilation.\"i didn't think i could do it,\" he says of his decision not to go back. instead, gleick and crossen moved into the weekend retreat they were already building in putnam county.\"this wouldn't have been a place to live full-time,\" he says, his voice starting to crack. \"our house is great if you want to be alone in the woods. it's lousy if you're a 9-year-old. go play with your friends? forget about it. whereas brooklyn heights was just a great place for a young boy. he could run out and go visit his pals next door.\"in the months after my first visit, gleick endures a twice-weekly physical therapy regimen and untold hours on the treadmill; he plays bridge online and in an occasional tournament with a few close friends. in the parking lot of a nearby shopping center, he learns to drive his new dark-green lexus gs-400, which has built-in gps, and discovers the cultural limitations of an adult living in the woods. \"the movies i'm reading about in the new york times are not available at the local malls,\" he gripes.in november i pay another visit. the hudson valley is a quilt of orange, red, and yellow; maple, oak, and sycamore leaves shimmer in the brilliant autumn sunshine. this time gleick is in khakis. \"i thought we'd go for a drive,\" he says, smiling.as we amble down to the car, i see that though gleick still limps, his walking is much improved. his new prosthesis has a hydraulic knee that gives him better mobility. his spirits are better, too. his book is almost finished and his doctors have told him that, eventually, he could be walking with only a minor limp, though no one knows for sure.we drive along the hudson in the new car, with gleick showing off its dashboard gps. the screen displays a blinking light to indicate where gleick should turn to stay on the course he's punched in. he ignores it and talks about the book, which originally was crossen's idea.\"i'm trying to look at many, many things in modern life that i believe are going faster, and i'm trying to look at why they're going faster and what effect they have on us,\" he says. \"we all know about fedex and instant pudding, but it doesn't mean we've looked at all the consequences of our desire for speed.\"as a boy and a young man, gleick was certainly in a rush, approaching life with relentless applications of energy and curiosity. his father was a prosperous lawyer in manhattan; his mother was a newsletter editor who, among other things, campaigned for eugene mccarthy and wrote a children's book explaining the concept of time. it was obvious early on that jim was unusually intelligent. his younger sister, betsy gleick, a time writer based in london, recalls how family lore had it that he was reading at age 2 or 3. \"the talk was always about how brilliant he was,\" she says, \"how brilliant and incredibly focused.\"gleick attended riverdale country school, where jfk once studied, and excelled in mathematics and science. but at harvard in 1972, he realized he didn't have what it takes to be a first-rate mathematician. (he sat in on an advanced math class and felt \"clueless.\") so he majored in english and linguistics and shopped for a passion. he found a home at the harvard crimson and decided to pursue journalism. one memorable contribution: a scathing review of a lecture series by leonard bernstein connecting music to linguistics. gleick dinged the lectures as \"intellectually shabby.\"gleick joined the times after his stint at the failed alternative newspaper in minneapolis, worked his way up for a few years, and was eventually named assistant metro editor. he maintained an abiding interest in science, and his first contribution to the times magazine, in 1983, was a cover story on douglas hofstadter, the mathematician-linguist who'd written the book g\u00f6del, escher, bach. soon enough, gleick found a place in the pages of the weekly science times section, where he honed his ability to convert complex swaths of science and technology into readable narratives.gleick detected a common theme running through many of his subjects: a search for patterns in seemingly random events and structures that was at the theoretical core of chaos theory. the more he learned about chaos, the more interested he became. \"the basic lessons of science were not necessarily connected to stuff that we care about, but it struck me that that wasn't true of chaos,\" he says. \"chaos was a science that was uniting all kinds of disciplines.\"he wrote a magazine article about scientists studying the nonlinear behavior of systems - people like edward lorenz, who determined by accident that minuscule inputs could have huge, complex outputs, far from the source. book publishers came calling, and gleick took a four-month leave of absence to report chaos: making a new science. he wrote mornings, evenings, and weekends for two years. published in 1987, chaos exploded onto best-seller lists and touched off a minor conflagration among chaos scientists, who had mixed reactions to their new high profile.\"gleick's book changed the whole field,\" says j. doyne farmer, who as a member of the \"chaos cabal\" at uc santa cruz was one of the book's stars. \"people started to take themselves too seriously. those who were left out got pissed off at those who weren't. things got ugly.\"murray gell-mann, a nobel prize-winning physicist who taught chaos at caltech in the '80s, complains that gleick's book \"exaggerated the importance\" of the subject. gell-mann was mentioned in the book, but he has a dim view of journalists who popularize scientific research, taking pains to point out that the french word for \"to popularize\" is vulgariser.\"i think it's best when scientists do their own work, as i did in my own book, the quark and the jaguar,\" he says. \"it used to be the standard thing for scientists to write their own books. if i'm not mistaken, it became unfashionable for many years and now it has come back in fashion. i like that.\"chaos earned gleick a seven-figure, two-book advance and his freedom as a writer. his next project took on the complex, entertaining life of richard feynman, the manhattan project veteran, legendary caltech faculty member, and nobel prize winner who essentially rewrote the understanding of quantum electrodynamics. gleick's 1992 book, genius: the life and science of richard feynman, was another hit.barely taking a breather during the months of marathon writing sessions on genius, gleick also found time to become one of the earliest internet pioneers. he liked to break up his day by indulging in videogames and online bridge. one problem with virtual bridge, circa 1992, was the exasperating state of net access - you got a unix shell account, and you had to type in tangles of arcane commands to get on the net. gleick figured he could do better. he approached uday ivatury, a programmer he knew from the manhattan bridge club, about the prospects of joining forces in a business. ivatury had never read gleick's books (he still hasn't), but he liked gleick's mind and agreed to a partnership.in november 1993, after months of intense work, gleick and ivatury launched the pipeline. its major advance was a graphical user-friendliness that to some extent anticipated what was coming on the world wide web. it was an immediate success. the customer base doubled in each of the first six months, and the company licensed its core software to independent and corporate service providers. fourteen months after the launch, the pipeline was purchased by psinet, the herndon, virginia-based isp; psinet bought it for $10 million in stock, a small fortune that multiplied when psinet went public a few months later. gleick got a bit more than half the payoff; his share value increased to about $15 million at the ipo and later rose as high as $28 million.after the big windfall, gleick returned to writing, in a new column for the times magazine suggested by rosenthal. during its four-year run, \"fast forward\" critically evaluated the limitations and frustrations of technology, and the scramble to define its future. one of gleick's favorite themes was that technology charts its own course - the net being the prime example.gleick made a few bum calls from his pulpit, as when he called aol a dinosaur in 1994. (\"i must concede that, for a dinosaur, steve case has done very well,\" he says now.) more often, he was on target, as with his column on push, the darling technology (and wired cover subject) of late 1996 and early 1997. \"the promotion of push is the silliest piece of puffery to waft along in several seasons,\" gleick wrote in march 1997, calling its failure \"preordained.\"but perhaps his most important piece in this period was a 1995 cover story called \"making microsoft safe for capitalism.\" the us justice department had already brought and settled its initial antitrust action against microsoft, but gleick was among the first big-name journalists to perceive that the antitrust issue was still unresolved, and that it was getting more serious with each passing day. \"[microsoft] does possess and covet monopolies, despite vehement denials from its lawyers,\" gleick wrote. its goal: to determine \"the standards and architectures that control the design of modern software.\"microsoft was upset by the piece, and the company's pr bigfoot, pam edstrom of waggener edstrom, quickly started calling reporters - the times' john markoff among them - to suggest that gleick had a blatant conflict of interest. after all, he still owned a lucrative stake in psinet, a direct competitor of uunet, a network firm in which microsoft then had a 13 percent interest.edstrom denies that there was an organized campaign to swat gleick, but gleick says bill gates himself unapologetically confirmed the story. \"a year later, at a face-to-face meeting at a stewart alsop conference, i confronted him,\" says gleick. \"i said, 'how come your pr people did this whispering campaign about me?' he said there was no whispering campaign. he said, 'there was something about you we thought people should know.'\" gates also said, according to gleick, \"i could show you the list\" of reporters who were contacted.__ forget false nostalgia for the slow life, says gleick, but expect to have \"trouble coping with the consequences.\" __\"he wasn't even ashamed of it,\" says gleick. \"it is not the way things are now, where he's trying to emphasize that he's not a hands-on guy.\"set for publication in september, faster: the acceleration of just about everything begins and ends in the office of gernot m. r. winkler, the director of the directorate of time, at the us naval observatory in washington, dc. in the opening pages, gleick explains the elaborate process by which true time is established. a master clock consults with clocks all over the world via satellite; their output is statistically merged at the bureau international des poids et mesures, outside paris.by the end he has offered a maddeningly fascinating perspective: time can be measured, but never contained.\"come to think of it, winkler is not really setting the pace - not for you,\" gleick writes. \"synchronize your watch according to his clocks, sure, but you will serve as your own director of your own time directorate. you will remember that time is defined, analyzed, measured, and even constructed by humans. it may help to think of time as a continuous flow, rather than a series of segmented packages. or to find aggressive ways of squandering the time you save.\"or at least to recognize,\" he concludes, \"that neither technology nor efficiency can acquire more time for you, because time is not a thing you have lost. it is not a thing you ever had.\"gleick portrays a world whose inhabitants are caught up in a whirl of mass adjustment. peter jennings' live suitcase-satellite uplink transmissions have stolen the dozen or so hours he previously had to compose a report, while film was being hand-delivered from one asian capital to another. products coming in on time and 50 percent over budget are far more profitable than products coming in six months late and on budget, so winning companies are scrambling to compress everything - from product-development cycles to each link in the supply chain. classical music stations shave seconds-long breaks between movements, \"jerking the listener from the andante to the minuet without a breath.\"we are moving from nanoseconds to factoseconds and from terabytes to petabytes, and gleick sees wonder in it all: \"it might be best to think of the one-minute news report as an art form that takes terseness and concision to the limit, akin to the haiku or the oil-paint miniature,\" he writes in faster. \"a flashed image can be like a subtle allusion in a long poem, resonating just below the threshold of comprehension.\"i arrange to meet gleick once more, this time in april, in manhattan, where he and crossen have bought an apartment. \"i feel tremendously busy,\" he tells me. \"i still take time to play bridge.\" when i ask him how the accident has changed his perception of time, he answers: \"too soon to tell.\"we meet at a restaurant near his new place; gleick quickly slides into the booth, shoving his cane out of sight.his manuscript is stacked on the table. having read it, i know that it's magnificently researched and written, but as i tell gleick, it left me feeling shortchanged in two ways. first, the book doesn't offer much direct analysis of the here's-what-you're-gaining, here's-what-you're-losing variety on society's acceleration. gleick does a great job showing that we're all hurrying up, but i was looking for some conclusions about whether our rushed environment is resulting in, say, better or worse business decisions. i wanted to know: is \"faster\" good for us? or not?gleick frowns. making such judgments is not what he set out to do, but when pressed he not too surprisingly comes down on the side of rapid forward motion. \"people have this kind of false nostalgia for primitive societies where time isn't money,\" he says. \"but at every stage where humans have had a choice between that existence and a more complicated and busy existence, we've chosen the complicated, busy existence. the fact that we've made those choices does not necessarily mean that we're idiots. it might be that we're right and we're having trouble coping with the consequences because we haven't thought it all through.\"the book is basically silent about gleick and his own relation to time. why?\"that would be too egotistical or navel-gazing or easy or something,\" he says. \"you don't have to read far between the lines to see that i'm writing about a personal experience. sometimes i feel that i'm a victim of 'hurry sickness' in the classic sense. i'm not happy if i get to the airplane too early. i see myself taking ridiculous shortcuts to save tiny amounts of time. so you could view the book as an elaborate exercise in self-justification.\" he laughs.\"have you wasted a lot of time in your life?\" i ask. \"it doesn't strike me that you have.\"\"why would you assume i hadn't?\"\"you've had a bunch of professional accomplishments in a very short span of time, any one of which would have satisfied most people.\"\"that's very flattering. but there's no connection - and you should know this, having read my book - between accomplishing things and wasting time. it is not true that people who accomplish things don't waste time and that people who waste time don't accomplish things. the very concept is ill-formed. you can't waste time and you can't save time; you can only choose what you do at any given moment.\"he scans the manuscript, flipping around to make sure i've been reading the most up-to-date version. he stops when he arrives at the dedication page. it reads:"}
