lobbied the government to slash its antitrust division. y' think they were related events? declan mccullagh reports from washington.", "author": "declan mccullagh", "category": "security", "type": "article", "timestamp": "10.16.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "washington -- when microsoft invited free-market allies to its campus last month, its pr flacks billed the  all-expense-paid junket as an information-sharing session.but some critics aren't so sure.just after attendees got home, they fired off a letter to congress suggesting that the budget of the justice department's antitrust division should be pared down a little. or, perhaps, maybe a lot.now, it's fair to say that groups like citizens for a sound economy, citizens against government waste, and the national taxpayers union are hardly fans of aggressive antitrust enforcement, and -- if they had gotten around to it -- would have sent the letter on general principles.but it's probably also true that getting fat checks from microsoft provided an additional incentive to make some time.no matter, says al foer, president of the american antitrust institute, who calls it coercion.\"with negotiations reportedly under way to resolve the government's case, microsoft's salvo is clearly an attempt to leverage its position through intimidation.... this lobbying effort is part of a longer-range strategy to keep the government from applying the sherman act to the high technology industry of the future -- which microsoft hopes to continue to dominate,\" he said in an email message friday.meanwhile, microsoft hasn't been idle. \"microsoft called us today and wanted us to start writing letters to the hill,\" said a source close to one group that receives funds from ms. \"nobody was quite sure what that would accomplish.\"yeah, good luck: lisa dean has an unlikely goal: to persuade her fellow conservatives to abandon their long-standing quest to rid the net of anything that might make your grandmother blush.as vice president of paul weyrich's free congress foundation, dean has recently been busy opposing a bill requiring federally funded libraries and schools to install filtering software. the bill, championed by ernest istook (r-oklahoma), is part of a juvenile justice bill that congress is in the final stages of considering.\"i'm trying to get conservatives to see what istook is doing is a precedent for giving washington control. then someone else comes in later and says we've got to filter gun sites. then the tobacco industry gets filtered and then comes fast foods,\" dean says.\"that's the attitude of the right. as long as they get rid of pornography that's all they care about.\"uncertain ally: when the white house hired law prof peter swire this spring, top officials proclaimed him to be the administration's chief privacy czar, and assured civil libertarians that swire would be their inside ally.but that hasn't turned out to be the case. instead, swire has made a point of defending the clinton administration's privacy misdeeds.\"their mo is to send out their privacy guy swire,\" complains one disgruntled privacy advocate.swire was scheduled to testify for the administration at a house committee hearing on thursday, but it was postponed until november.the topic: fidnet, the controversial plan that would include ongoing government surveillance of the internet.__trademark tussle:__ law professors are urging the us house of representatives to delay voting next tuesday on the trademark cyberpiracy prevention act.in a letter sent to speaker dennis hastert late friday, they said the bill unfairly expands the rights of trademark owners far beyond any given under existing law, and benefits corporations at the expense of individuals. signers include harvard university's lawrence lessig, georgetown university's julie cohen, and university of miami's michael froomkin.privacy is an \"antisocial act\": scott bradner wasn't surprised to hear the fbi say this week that they wanted an easily wiretappable internet.the veteran internet engineering task force area coordinator and harvard university networking guru has already had his arm twisted by the feds.it happened when the ietf decided to wire encryption into the next-generation internet protocol, ipv6.\"someone very high up in the us justice department told me that week that for the ietf to support encryption was an 'antisocial act,'\" bradner said.tell us what you really think: debate is getting snarly on a mailing list the ietf created to debate whether the net should be tappable for the feds -- or, for that matter, non-us police too.so far, support for the scheme seems to be coming mostly from telephone companies.\"can we just write the preface that says this is a useless disgusting, repugnant thing, but if we need to do it, this is how we do it, and get on with doing it?\" wrote one engineer.big mistake. soon libertarians were flaming him and his allies mercilessly. \"i'd like to step back one step from the technical discussions of which variant of zyklon b is most effective, to discuss the question of whether this is a good idea anyway,\" wrote longtime cypherpunk adam back, making a reference to the poisonous gas used by the nazis.back's solution: a no-cooperation approach.beware technocrats: what's the only thing worse than having us government bureaucrats dictate internet standards? answer: having international government bureaucrats do it.that's what the international telecommunications union, a paragon of byzantine bureaucracy, is planning. yoshio itsumi, secretary general of itu, said at the telecom 99 forum in geneva that he was itching to get into the job of influencing standards like domain name administration.one longtime itu critic sent us a four-point criticism of the plan.in interests of brevity, here's point numero uno: \"they did everything possible to prevent [the internet from] coming into existence - ranging from banning private international user networks, preventing the lease of private circuits for internet use [and when that began to fail, jack up prices so high it had the same effect], promulgating alternative standards that were mandated for use rather than internet standards, promulgating alternative services, funding alternative implementations, and basically bad-mouthing and banning the internet from their forums and dialogue.\"hey, if you think that's dense, be glad we didn't include points two through four.gop.gov: last week we told you about republican conference chairman j.c. watt's candid \"they-suck\" appraisal of his colleagues web sites.now he's decided to do something about it.a project under development called \"gop.gov\" will let party loyalists craft their own mygop.gov home page where they can receive the latest republican info on both local and national topics.the forthcoming web site will replace hillsource.house.gov.the plan is for much of the news to be provided by gop house press secretaries."}
