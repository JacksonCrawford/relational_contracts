legions of devotees are as numerous as ever. what's going on? well, for one thing, it's harder to set yourself apart from the competition. by craig bicknell.", "author": "craig bicknell", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "12.06.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "last october, ted ladd had a weird experience: he couldn't find any new net porn sites. searching out smut is ladd's business, or rather the business of his company, web-filtering firm websense. it identifies porn sites and blocks them for big corporate customers, who don't want employees indulging libidinous urges on company time.\"my database guy came to me and said, 'our web crawlers and our human searchers are having a hard time finding porn sites,'\" ladd said.this did not compute. after all, the number of new porn sites has more than doubled every year since websense started filtering in 1994. the company has built a smut site collection several hundred thousand strong.but when ladd crunched the new data, the trend was clear: web porn's growth is leveling off; still growing at about 40 percent annually, but heading south fast.\"it's a pretty dramatic dropoff,\" ladd said. \"it looks like the market is starting to become saturated. maybe people are starting to realize you can't make money by throwing up a web page.\"yup. just ask caity mcpherson, cofounder of bay area adult sites, a nonprofit association of adult web biz types.\"there are hundreds of thousands of amateur sites out there that, at best, earn $0-3,000 a month,\" she said. \"putting up a new site is really like opening up a coffee shop in the financial district between all the starbucks.\"this is not to say overall traffic to porn sites is slowing. it isn't.but the competition for eyeballs is fierce, and porn sites have to find new niches to exploit if they want to get noticed, said mark hardie, formerly an analyst at forrester research, now ceo of entertainment technology corporation. these days, slapping up a web site with still photos lifted from porn flicks just won't make it. it's not like the old days.perhaps that helps explain the eye-popping proliferation of super-hardcore fetish sites. porntrepreneurs may not be launching lots of new sites, but they sure seem to be swapping out the standard porn-flick flair with something a bit more ... eye-catching.hello, shemale-bondage-teen-latex lust. and whoa, who knew we felt so passionate about our pets?\"when i started studying porn six years ago, all the really hard-core stuff was in the newsgroups, it wasn't on the web,\" said donna rice hughes, anti-porn crusader, the author, and the downfall of former presidential candidate gary hart. \"now it's absolutely everywhere. it's so proliferated now, i don't think it could get much worse.\"well, actually it could get a lot better, says sex columnist and author susie bright.\"erotic sensationalism and taboo-breaking is inevitable when we bear such a cruel tradition of american puritanism and censorship,\" bright wrote in a recent yahoo internet life column she sent wired news during an email interview. \"the public is preoccupied with infantile fixations, much like babies who must thoroughly examine the contents of their diaper before they are able to leave it behind.\"\"the technological and censor-free breakthrough of the internet has spawned a fetish market that literally has to be seen to be believed. the internet has opened pandora's box; fetish is king.\"but hey, babies grow up and ditch their diapers. so might we, said bright.\"if we could just stomach 'anything goes!' for a couple of decades, maybe we could actually move on, as they say.\"the worst thing, she said, would be to put a legislative lid on the box. \"a move like that will take us right back to the starting block, another generation stuck in repression's play pen.\"wrong, say anti-porn activists. these fetish sites are ample evidence of a pending sexual apocalypse.\"we're already experiencing a sexual holocaust,\" university of pennsylvania psychologist mary anne layden said. \"the ramifications [of ubiquitous porn] are hard to imagine. we're already at tsunami levels.\"all this fetish porn serves as anecdotal evidence of a theory that layden and anti-porn crusaders have long maintained: porn is addictive, and once you're hooked, you need a harder and harder fix to get off. next thing you know, depraved sex addicts are raping the populace. layden has counseled dozens of sex criminals. she says super hardcore porn helped drive them all over the edge.even if the addiction stops short of criminal behavior, layden said, it distorts sexual expectations, destroys intimacy, wrecks marriages. there's already an epidemic of debilitating sex addiction, she claims, likening hardcore net porn to the \"new crack cocaine.\"\"there are 80 sex-addict support groups in philadelphia alone. this is a massive number of groups, indicating what a massive problem it is,\" she said.layden has appeared in pbs specials and before congress, and her theories fuel the arguments of anti-porn crusaders like rice hughes.\"i think it's important that we start to view this as toxic material, and start looking at what the impact will be on the human environment,\" hughes said.instead of the decades-old question about what would happen if pornography was widely available, academics studying porn are now asking: here it is, so what?(we're talking effect on adults here, by the way. for the moment, we'll side-step the super-heated furor about child porn and porn's effect on kids).\"if you look at all the research, you'll find that there's no difference in frequency of consuming sexually explicit materials between criminal sex offenders and the rest of the population,\" said dan linz, a psychologist and researcher at the university of california, santa barbara.while sex offenders do tend to choose more violent porn than \"normal\" folk, there's no way to know whether the violent porn spawned the violent act or whether violent tendencies fostered the desire for violent porn.layden concedes the point, but says common sense shows a causal correlation. then why hasn't there been more research that might help settle the issue?\"because the people who are really seeing the effect are the clinicians, and they're so busy treating people, they don't have time to research,\" layden replied.men who watch porn in a university lab show a temporarily increased acceptance of rape myths and callous attitudes towards women, layden points out. but the same studies show that r-rated movies have the same effect. and again, there's no study that links the laboratory attitude shift to any real-world behavior. research aside, no one debates that hardcore porn's ubiquity has made it an increasingly routine fixture of the common culture. it's losing its shock value. it's starting to seem normal. just look at the cover of the 6 december issue of the new yorker, a cartoonish look at what office workers are really looking at on the computer screens inside their cubes.\"the most bizarre image you can find on the internet is quickly morphing its way to the general public's view,\" wrote bright.bright cites this example: there's a boatload of fetish sites featuring women in stiletto heels stepping on men's genitals. substitute a man's hand for his privates, and voila, you have the current louis vuitton leather ad in vogue.academics who teach classes about porn have seen a big shift in student's attitudes.\"when i first started bringing pornographic stuff into class, i'd have to warn students, 'you might be horrified,'\" said uc-berkeley professor linda williams, author of the critically acclaimed book, hard core: power, pleasure, and the 'frenzy of the visible.' \"now no one's horrified. they've all seen it.\"\"obscenity has been replaced by \"onscenity,\" williams says. \"obscenity is off-scene, off the scene of public discourse.\"onscenity is everyday, familiar as your own naked butt in the mirror.all this is anathema to anti-porn activists, who decry a creeping \"desensitization\" to hardcore porn. if people get numb to bestiality, what the hell are the pornographers going to do next to get a dirty shock out of people. what will the sex addicts demand?\"porn works just the opposite of the supply-demand curve,\" says rice hughes. \"it actually creates more demand, following this pattern: initial exposure, desensitization, then the need for more deviant material to get the same arousal.\"hogwash, said uc-santa barbara professor constance penley, who teaches a class on porn film.\"i grew up devouring grimm's fairy tales, which are completely twisted. by the [anti-porn advocates' logic], i should be a mass murderer. i should be a serial killer.\"isn't it possible that all this way-out net porn will simply plateau, perhaps wane? perhaps, as bright suggests, folks will move on. maybe have a casual look now and again, but nothing obsessive.\"people may very well get bored with porn,\" says philippa levine, a professor at the university of southern california who studies the history of sexuality. \"and that doesn't mean they'll start raping each other. they'll more likely say, 'that's boring, what are the alternatives to porn?'\"while most researchers stop far short of any claim that far-out, freaky porn in your face is particularly healthy, many find some seeds of good in its proliferation.\"once everybody's seen it, one good thing is that discussions begin,\" says williams. \"from my view, that's positive. porn is no longer a hidden-away thing that men get to know about and women aren't supposed to.\"now you're talking, said bright.\"i lived near adult bookstores for years, and patronized liquor stores that sold dirty magazines, but because i considered myself a 'good girl,' i would not go to such places or buy such magazines. of course, when i got a secret chance to scrutinize those materials, under someone's bed or whatever, i jumped for it.\"\"the internet gives everyone that 'secret' chance \u2013 you don't have to rely on being a babysitter for the right horndog anymore, or coming across the right fishing tackle box stuffed with hustler centerfolds.\"yup, agreed penn's layden.\"the internet gives you instant, anonymous access to every sort of porn. as a result, it's snagging more and more people that never would have seen [these things]. damage is going to reverberate through society.\""}
