and e-commerce sites want kids to start using debit accounts early and often. parents aren't so sure. by joanna glasner.", "author": "joanna glasner", "category": "business", "type": "article",

mathiesen said. \"it's the age where probably the most kids are going to start buying their own stuff, and they're not yet ready to have something where they can go over their limit.\"even by those standards, mathiesen is getting an early start. for more than a month, the 10-year-old atlanta, georgia, youngster has used a service called pocketcard, a visa for kids linked to a prepaid limit by their parents.so far, he's used it to buy games, videos, and knickknacks in stores, and to buy products over the internet at amazon.com.mathiesen says he's the first among his friends with his own card, but financial services companies expect credit for kids to skyrocket.in the past year, debit-type cards targeting children and teenagers have sprung up like wild mushrooms on soggy ground. services range from online accounts that kids can use to shop online to debit cards to full-fledged credit cards that teenagers can co-sign with their parents.pocketcard and online accounts like rocketcash and icanbuy.com have developed a following among the early-adopter crowd. with teen spending in the united states estimated at us$140 billion in 1999, there's room to grow.but youth-oriented financial services still have to overcome parents' widespread skepticism about the wisdom of passing along the habit of paying with plastic to the next generation.'i'm not big on giving him a credit card because it gives the wrong impression,\" said vickie bennett, of dallas, shopping with her 9-year-old son sean at san francisco's metreon entertainment center.others say kid-targeted spending services are just one more example of america's consumer culture gone awry.\"i think for a child to be given a credit card is teaching them to spend rather than to save,\" said betsy taylor, executive director of the center for a new american dream, an organization aimed at reducing conspicuous consumption. taylor said she's particularly leery of online accounts, where the ease of shopping may lure kids to buy too much, too quickly.the financial services industry maintains that individual accounts for kids are safer than the alternative of using their parents' credit cards.\"for the most part, most kids when they need to make a transaction, they get their parents credit card number,\" said robert sterling, financial services analyst with jupiter communications. \"it's more cumbersome than the parent being able to electronically enable a transaction for the kid or an allowance payment.\"sterling predicts the reluctance of parents to hand over their credit card numbers will eventually persuade them to accept other methods of payment. but he declined to predict which would attract the largest following.among the contenders are internet account-type services like icanbuy, launched in march, which lets children and teenagers buy a limited set of merchandise with an electronic wallet. parents can choose what level of control they want over their children's purchases. rocketcash lets kids buy goods online from selected merchants.pocketcard works a little differently. the card is accepted online or in stores, just like a visa card, but its spending limit is tied to an amount prepaid by parents.most of the services have a couple of things in common: none give children the chance to rack up credit. and most let parents keep track of where children and teens are spending their money.\"it's a way of giving them purchasing power with supervision,\" said william c. scheurer, pockcetcard's founder and ceo, who said he got the idea for the company after raising four teenagers. as part of pocketcard's service, parents can get emails notifying them every time a child buys something with their card.nearly all kid-targeted account services tell parents that they offer a way to teach children about budgeting by going over what they spend and where. since nearly everyone will eventually have to deal with real credit cards, it makes sense to learn how it all works early.or not.\"i think in theory this sounds great but in reality parents don't have time to monitor this kind of thing,\" taylor said. \"at the same time, kids are getting bombarded by advertising everywhere.\"but many parents see safety in separation. alden mathiesen's father, andrew mathiesen, says he's far more comfortable about the prospect of giving his 10-year-old a credit card than he was with the alternative.\"at least he's not typing my credit card [number] over the web,\" he said."}
