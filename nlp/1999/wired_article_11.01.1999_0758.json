(\"attack on mp3 piracy escalates,\"29.oct.1999 ).the entire college-age population of this country and beyond are using illegal mp3s because they are a perfect source of storable music that is good quality and free.why buy a cd full of songs you don't like to listen to ...? especially when you can get the song that you want for free on the internet. i would like to know when that makes the everyday college student a part of organized crime and a pornography user? it is a load of bull and whoever said it obviously has not done any research about the common mp3 user.as long as it is free, freely supported, easily found and freely enjoyed, it will continue and there is nothing that will convince people to do otherwise. the music industry is in the wrong here. they need to change with the times and make music available on the web and cheaply. they will make more money that way. if they took one look at e-business, they would find that if they marketed their bands and music on the net better, they could really make money off the music they produce. the music industry needs to rethink their strategy and join the rest of us in the digital e-commerce age!"}
