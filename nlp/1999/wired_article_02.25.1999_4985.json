(a unit of hughes electronics corp.) and the chinese-singaporean asia-pacific mobile telecommunications company.in past political flare-ups, china has steered purchases of aircraft and other big-ticket items away from us suppliers. analysts said that with this move, washington risked losing us dominance of the multi-billion dollar global satellite industry.the us decision to block the sale was based on fears that technology learned through launching satellites could be used to perfect launchers for nuclear weapons. washington said the chinese military was deeply involved in the satellite consortium.the first us rejection of a chinese satellite deal, part of a long bilateral technology transfer dispute, adds to the flak albright will fly into when she arrives on 1 march.albright, visiting china to prepare for premier zhu rongjia's trip to washington in april, must also deal with a host of disputes that have cast a shadow on us-china ties since the feel-good presidential summits in 1997 and 1998 in washington and beijing.albright is expected to raise beijing's recent crackdown on political dissent, and prod china to take steps to cut its $57 billion trade surplus with the united states and make headway on its long-stalled bid to join the world trade organization.copyright"}
