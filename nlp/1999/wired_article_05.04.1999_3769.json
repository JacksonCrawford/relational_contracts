she didn't realize that her online broker, like most, doesn't connect straight into the market -- it runs through a middleman. the broker had a problem with the connection. the women bought, then canceled orders for large chunks of stock, but the orders were actually never canceled. tough luck.similar afflictions routinely befall investors who don't understand basic investing tools like limit orders, or the perils of buying stock on margin, using borrowed money from the broker.a good bit of the fault for these failings lies at the feet of the online brokers, levitt said. most fail to provide adequate disclosure of their policies to investors. many have suffered service failings, in part due to the massive surge in demand brought on by a constant barrage of national advertisements.\"if you're marketing your firm to new customers, you'd better be able to provide them service when they do business with you,\" levitt said.he singled out an ad for discover brokerage as representative of a trend among online brokerages to portray their services as a sure-fire ticket to easy street.\"there may be an increasing population of tow-truck drivers who now own their own islands as a result of online investing. but, in a market where many investors are susceptible to quixotic euphoria, i'm worried these commercials step over the line.\"levitt saved his most pointed remarks for the day-traders, the increasing numbers of traders who buy and sell stocks by the minute, or less. some people compare day-traders to speculators, levitt said, but that's not a good comparison. \"personally, i don't think day-traders are speculating, because traditional speculation requires some market knowledge. they are instead gambling, which doesn't.\"the sec took a look at one day-trading firm in which 37 of 38 traders lost money.so what's the sec going to do about all this cluelessness? not much. \"i'm not convinced it's necessary for the sec to pronounce a totally new and radical scheme of regulation,\" he said.instead, the goal is to make investors smarter. to do that, the sec has created a web page outlining the pitfalls of online investing. it has asked online brokerages to post links to the site prominently throughout their own web sites. in addition, levitt sent out letters to all of the online brokerages asking them to improve the quality of their disclosures to investors.to help staunch the rising incidents of stock fraud like the recent pairgain incident, levitt announced that he would double the size of the sec's cyberforce, the 125-member team that scours the net for fraud. in the next two weeks, the sec will present a number of new fraud cases based on the work of the cyberforce.additionally, the sec will create a formal advisory committee on technology that will examine online trading and suggest ways to safeguard investors and insure the market's integrity.the sec has also begun to take a hard look at the way online brokerages fulfill customers' orders. many of the brokers sell their order flow to middlemen. they had better be selling at the lowest possible rate, levitt cautioned. \"all firms have an obligation to ensure the best execution of their customers' orders. that's not just good business practice; it's a legal obligation.\"levitt stressed in closing that he hopes the sec will not have to draft new regulations to curb abuses in the burgeoning online trading world. but his opening remarks left little doubt that he's prepared to push ahead if need be.\"i don't rule out the possibility that there may come a time when the sec sees a need for new approaches to better meet the imperatives of the internet.\""}
