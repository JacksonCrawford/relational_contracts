because the cocktail is composed of readily available substances, the procedure would be difficult to patent.and there are other caveats that temper the positive results. the alcohol and caffeine combination only worked in the rats when administered in the most painstakingly measured doses, and it had to be applied within two hours of a stroke.tests where the rats were given regular doses for a week before, but not immediately preceding the stroke, provided no beneficial effects. and if too much or too little of the dose was given, the result was lost completely. \"it's a peculiar effect,\" grotta said.the team will publish their findings in the journal neuropharmacology later this year."}
