only if the numbers are correct.\"the figures are a little bit suspect,\" said seema williams, an analyst at forrester research. \"lots of people have been visiting the toys r us site, but [brick-and-mortar] toys r us [stores] have been turning people away. they just don\u2019t have the capacity.\"the statistics fall short, says kate maddox, the author. \"while media metrix\u2019s numbers are a good indication of a heavy-traffic site, they don\u2019t look at e-commerce revenue at all.\"internet credit card company nextcard is taking a shot at analyzing e-tail transactions by tracking the number of purchases made with nextcard credit cards.nextcard claims it's a good indication of overall net buying behavior. the demographics of its 140,000 card holders (averaging 37-years-old with an annual income of $56,000) are fairly close to those of typical internet shoppers (40 years old with income of $60,000, according to forrester). the dollar amount of each purchase is not examined. neither is the number of visits to a site.nextcard\u2019s method produced the list of \"top ten eholiday retailers\" for the last two weeks of november that included (1) amazon.com, (2) barnesandnoble.com, (3) buy.com, (4) reel.com, (5) onsale.com, (6) etoys.com, (7) cdnow.com, (8) ubid.com, (9) pets.com, and (10) egghead.com.the two lists agree on amazon.com. otherwise, the nextcard list largely contradicts the media metrix survey, especially in its conclusions about real world stores in the online world. nextcard maintains they\u2019re still badly trailing virtual retailers.\"there is a surprising lack of brinkandmortar.coms,\" nextcard\u2019s jamie hale said in an email. \"site visit statistics show that they have traffic, but when you look at actual transactions, it appears that all except barnesandnoble.com (no. 2) are having problems converting browsers to buyers. etoys, for example, is strong at no. 6 and grew purchases by over 200 percent in the last two weeks, while toysrus.com is not even on the list.\"but one can't read too much into those numbers either, according to forrester\u2019s williams, who believes nextcard's user base is out of sync with the larger net population, which is loaded with geeks and early adopters.in other words, nextcard\u2019s top 10 list is no more useful in examining e-commerce revenue than media metrix\u2019s.whom can you believe? nobody, appears to be the short answer. or as maddox sums it up: \"it' s difficult to say who\u2019s making money this holiday.\""}
