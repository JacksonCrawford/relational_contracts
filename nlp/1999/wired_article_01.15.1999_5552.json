(dbcc), a provider of real-time stock quotes.the company had a loss of $8.17 million on revenue of just $4.94 million in the nine months ended 30 september 1998. as is typical with internet companies, marketwatch \"expects operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future,\" according to its prospectus.no matter. investors view the scrappy company as a potential rival to publications like the wall street journal and the business sections of metropolitan newspapers. unlike a newspaper, marketwatch won't have to contend with newsprint, delivery trucks, unions, and other messy expenses, analysts said.still, some traders saw reason to be concerned about the buying frenzy.\"this is not healthy,\" slavin said. if net issues eventually take a tumble the impact could drag down the whole stock market, he said.meanwhile, dbc and cbs profited nicely from marketwatch's debut. each owns 38 percent of marketwatch stock.marketwatch itself raised about $47 million. it will use the proceeds to pay back debt and expand its operations."}
