they're losing advertising revenues and the chance to present their content their way.others, however, balk at the notion that hyperlinking requires a licensing deal or someone's permission. hyperlinking is the very nature of the web, they argue, and no one should have to pay to merely point to a file on the net.the courts have not yet resolved the issue.since all the major cases on the issue have settled out of court and congress has not yet weighed in on the matter, legal experts say the law is silent on deep linking. that doesn't help risenhoover, however, whose five person web operation suffers daily deep linking attempts.\"i've been seeing this on a daily basis for two years,\" he said. \"i think it's great for the artist because it gives them promotional bandwidth but it's also bad for the provider because it's costing them money without giving them the proper credit.\"x-radio's streaming software supports 65 simultaneous realmedia streams. adding more users means upgrading to more expensive software. with no venture capital funding, he says that deep linking means that \"legitimate users of our web site could be denied access.\"risenhoover also raises the issue of pay-per-play licensing fees. what does it mean, he wonders, when another site deep-links into a pay-per-play site and taps a stream for free?the american society of composers, artists, and songwriters (ascap) has a few answers to that question. the society collects royalties for most major and some independent labels.\"if you stay on your site and you're importing music from another site, you need a license,\" said phil cerosland, ascap's vice president of marketing. \"if you're just linking out [to the main page] you don't need a license.\"so far, more than 1,200 web outfits have signed deals with ascap with one of the latest and most prominent being mp3.com, he said. \"licensing fees start at $250 per year. that gives you unlimited use of four million songs in our repertory.\"ascap recently came under fire for what critics called a \"mafia-type shakedown\" of web site operators who deep-linked to online music. cerosland defended ascap's actions.\"there's a perception that the internet should be free -- and it's a fantastic medium -- but i think the people who are creating [music] need to be protected in some fair way,\" he said.\"what we're trying to do is protect the interests of our members. we're not a bunch of thugs.\"before pursuing licensing arrangements, ascap and site operators should first ask if a deep linking site generates value from that linkage, cerosland said.\"i think the only reason you'd link to a radio station site is so that people visiting your site can enjoy music,\" he said. \"that site is deriving value from that link.\"but robins gross, an attorney with the electronic frontier foundation, said the issue is not so simple. not every case of deep linking to online music constitutes infringement.\"there are groups like ascap and universal [studios] who want to require a license for merely linking to sites that have copyrighted material on them,\" she said. \"that's just not correct legally. it's just one of these deals where the rights holder will send out a letter and see what they can get.\"although the courts have not yet ruled on the matter, traditional legal wisdom suggests that sites that trick users into thinking that the deep linked content is their own might be guilty of an unfair trade practice, she said.on the other hand, gross said a list of links clearly billed as such should be just fine since the links are like a collection of facts. \"in a case like that where you were being clear and you're not trying to confuse the public i don't think that you would need a license.\"but risenhoover is paying the price every day.\"let's say we've got to pay two cents per performance and let's say we've got other people are linking into our site -- we've still got to pay,\" he says. \"it's not just performance costs. it's server costs. there's a bandwidth issue also; bandwidth's not free.\"he isn't waiting for the lawyers and courts to sort it out. a little server tweaking goes a long way.by default, realmedia's streaming server software makes it easy for users to deep link straight to the music file. but risenhoover has figured out how to change that with a few lines of code.\"the script looks to see where they're coming from and if they're not coming from x-radio, it tells them to piss off.\""}
