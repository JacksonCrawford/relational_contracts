this summer, 15 public schools in idaho are going to find out. thanks to a multimillion-dollar grant from the j.a. & kathryn albertson foundation, students in 15 idaho schools will try out bleeding-edge technologies in prototype classrooms of the future, designed and built by educational software developer and ip services company human code.using sophisticated computing infrastructure and a virtual private network, 900 teachers and their students will have on-site access to videoconferencing over the internet, high-speed web connections, and state-of-the-art audio-visual equipment.each classroom will be equipped with a dedicated high-bandwidth network and customized software that will allow interaction with students and professors around the world, while providing access to information unavailable in the small schools' libraries.\"it can look like a traditional classroom, and then you can swing a monitor over and you're connected to the world,\" said chris gibson, technical advisor at jerome high school, located about 115 miles southwest of boise, idaho. \"in a science classroom, students can do group videoconferencing with university folk down in the rain forest. they can be actively involved in sorting and collating data.\"according to international data corp., a framingham, massachusetts, technology research firm, thousands of schools across the country have access to the internet, and more than 60 percent of students have already engaged in electronic field trips and collaborative projects online.the idaho project raises students to a higher level of technological sophistication by providing video over ip and a computing infrastructure that will support interactive multimedia learning software on every student's desk.human code wants to integrate technology into the classroom environment as a means to empower teachers, not compete with them.\"this is not a plan to replace teachers with computers. anything that's effective in this domain has to be personal and meaningful and relevant,\" said david palumbo, vice president for learning technologies at human code.\"we want to create educational environments that are so compelling and so interactive that you can't wait to see what you're going to learn today. we want to have spectacular interactions, where students are in control of their learning,\" palumbo said. the inspiration for the project came from the work of trailblazers at several universities, who used the internet to link public schools with college-level research projects and professors.northwestern university hosted covis, with help from the national science foundation, and vanderbilt university started the learning technology center to interact with dozens of high schools around the country.the human code project is part of a 3-year initiative to improve idaho's public school system, using technology to enhance curriculum and teach new research and collaboration skills.each classroom was tailored to suit the teaching style and curriculum requirements of its school. some have teachers directing interactive software programs from the back of the classrooms, while others place the teacher in the center of the room, on an equal footing with the computers and the students.all are equipped with the latest software and hardware: micron pcs, intel teamstations, microsoft productivity software, and collaboration software, such as \"i teach you,\" patterned after aol's icq chat software.in some schools, the access to technology is enabling educators to shift from traditional learning to project-based learning, where students network with each other and gather information to solve problems.\"we have an emphasis on project-based learning because, quite frankly, the dissemination and regurgitation of information is pretty passive,\" said wiley dobbs, principal at o'leary junior high school in twin falls, idaho.the school's educational approach has been transformed, dobbs said, emphasizing teamwork and collaboration among students and among teachers, who typically are divided by their schedules and classroom walls.\"ten years from now, it's going to be painfully obvious which schools have undergone this systemic change and which have not,\" dobbs said.the program isn't scheduled to go live until the middle of june, students have already begun reaping the benefits. jerome high school's gibson has hired two seniors to help him maintain the school's email servers and install 1,500 new pcs.\"it's going to be fun stuff to play with,\" said carlos hernandez, senior at jerome high school."}
