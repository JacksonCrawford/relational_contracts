nope, a new survey says.", "author": "reuters", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "12.17.1999 03:10 PM", "text": "remember the name of that \"dot-com\" web site whose clever ad you saw on television last night? probably not. neither, apparently, does anybody else.web sites flush with cash from internet investors are flooding the airwaves with billions of dollars in advertising this christmas season. but advertising industry analysts warn that money might be going to waste.a survey by the internet research firm active research of san francisco found that even among people who shop online, consumers recalled only a small number of ads.twenty-five percent of those surveyed couldn't remember a single commercial. the ads cited the most came from amazon.com inc., already the biggest and best-known online retailer.even amazon's ads, which far surpassed the rest of the field, managed to spark a memory in just one in 10 shoppers. only yahoo inc. and etoys inc. managed to attain a 3 percent recall rate, while scores of big-spending sites hit 1 percent or lower. heavily-played national television ads should be in the 15-to-30 percent range to be considered effective, advertising researchers say.but the ad clutter and the reliance by dot-coms on overly clever ads that don't say much about what their sites do, are turning the holiday season into a potential us$1 billion bust for the online companies. the post-holiday season could see many dot-coms failing, analysts say.\"the holiday season has created a tremendous pressure for companies to draw people to their sites,\" said jerry arbittier, of competitive media reporting, the biggest firm tracking ad spending. he called the internet sector \"one of the fastest growing industries, if not the fastest, we have ever seen.\"fueling the ad spending are the billions that venture capitalists and stock market investors have poured into e-commerce companies. web entrepreneurs aiming for \"speed to market\" and \"first mover advantage\" have created a traffic jam of dot-coms on america's television channels.\"brand differentiation is becoming increasingly difficult given the number and size of advertising campaigns from internet companies flush with cash,\" said derek brown of volpe brown whelan in a recent report.\"only a few ads are breaking through the noise,\" said tom dubois, chief executive of active research, which employs automated surveying techniques on the internet that reach millions of users a month. the advertising recall survey had 1,734 respondents reached between 22 november and 15 december, the height of the christmas shopping season.many consumers said they were overwhelmed by the number of commercials on the airwaves but underwhelmed by the message.\"which tv internet ad for shopping is the most memorable to you,\" they were asked. \"none,\" said a 45-year-old man. \"there are too many appearing on tv to remember the names or what they specialize in.\"\"they are all a blur,\" said another consumer, and one commented, \"there are too many ads already on tv to be adding internet shops to the pie.\"while the commercials may not help specific sites, the overall online shopping \"pie\" is definitely getting bigger, with spending expected to surge to $8.5 billion, nearly triple last year's level, broker volpe brown whelan reported.the tv ads have helped pump up awareness for online shopping in general, with internet commercials getting twice the notice of other ad categories, according to researcher lucy hughes of western media, the los angeles based media placement giant. usually, consumers pay attention to only 10 percent of ads, but web-centric spots get 20 percent-plus ratings.but \"shock value\" is what draws the attention, said dubois. one shopping site, cyberian outpost, gained ad industry notoriety for shooting hamsters from a cannon and having wolves chase a high school marching band. \"a lot of people remembered the hamsters but didn't remember outpost.\"shock treatment \"starts to lose its effect when everybody is using it,\" said dubois. and those that rely on humor fall down because \"they spend 25 seconds of the ad giving you the joke and the punchline and five seconds telling you what the dot-com actually does,\" said western media executive vice president for new media kent valandra.how do online shoppers get to the sites they use, if tv isn't luring them? active research concluded from its survey that internet search services and online shopping services steer them.ironically, it's \"mature brands,\" that might benefit the most from the blast of tv advertising, said volpe brown's derek brown, citing established online services like gap, ebay and amazon.meanwhile, traditional consumer retailers, like wal-mart, k-mart and best buy, with their years of experience in brand marketing, have been flocking to the internet to set up new services in recent weeks, with existing players like yahoo, america online inc., and microsoft corp.and the heavy flow of new advertising promises to run well into the new year, with the super bowl shaping up as a battle of the dot-coms, and adweek magazine reporting that one in three pitches made this year for upcoming campaigns -- $3 billion of the $10 billion total -- came from e-commerce marketers."}
