(the short answer seems to be that the white house -- divided between mayors who want to tax and businesses who don't want to be taxed -- is siding with the local officials. but it won't be bill clinton who will be in office when the moratorium expires in 2001.)\"they pay a price for this. this was expensive,\" grover told wired news. \"they don't want this to come up before gore runs in new york.\"persnickety privacy: if there's one thing you can count on in washington, it's the never-say-die advocates at the electronic privacy information center finding something to complain about.in a survey released this week, epic reported that -- gasp! -- only 82 of the top 100 shopping sites had privacy policies that described what they would do with the personal info you have the option of providing.what's more, the group said: \"not one of the companies adequately addressed all the elements of fair information practices. we also found that the privacy policies available at many web sites are typically confusing, incomplete, and inconsistent.\"during a conference call friday afternoon, epic director marc rotenberg said more government regulation was necessary."}
