(tci).\"at&t has never argued until today that we are forcing them to provide a telecommunications service,\" thatcher told the judges. \"they have actually come up with a whole new argument today they never brought up in district court.\"but after the hearing, he and other officials suggested that even if the appeals court overturns the portland law it could lead to a national policy requiring open access to high-speed internet lines.\"we don't care whether we ultimately win or lose,\" said portland city commissioner erik sten. \"we care that the internet has choice.\"mark rosenblum, at&t's vice president for legal affairs, said the company would welcome a ruling that its high-speed access product is a telecommunications service or \"facility.\"\"in either case if a decision comes down on that ground, we win,\" he said.contrary to sten's argument, he said at&t would not necessarily be required to open the athome service to rival internet service providers under federal law.\"we (would) be providing it as a brand new local telephone competitor trying to compete against the local telephone monopolies,\" he said. \"the national telecom policy is to foster this kind of new entry by competitors like us, and it's not subject to all those same regulations.\"<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/news/reuters.html\">copyright</a>* 1999 reuters limited.*"}
