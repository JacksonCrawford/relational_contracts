[potential employers] would be a bit skeptical about an academic approach.\"at least one leading business school agrees.\"[a degree in e-commerce] seems awfully, awfully specialized,\" said janet zich, associate news director of stanford university's graduate school of business.despite the fact that almost one-fifth of last year's gsb graduating class are working at high-tech companies, stanford has no plans to offer a specialty program in e-commerce.\"people who graduated from business school 10 years ago did not have the opportunity to learn anything about e-commerce, yet they're working in it right now,\" said zich. \"they're doing that because they have basic knowledge which they can adapt as the business world changes.... it's your idea, the spirit that lies behind it, and how creative you are that really gets you going in e-commerce.\""}
