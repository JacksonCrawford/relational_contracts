280,000 wince units sold, for a share of 15 percent. the market-research firm predicts that microsoft's piece of the marketplace will double in '99, leaving palm with 64 percent.but there's more to the story than operating systems. palm and windows ce reflect two philosophies: elegant utilitarianism versus sexy featurism. for better or worse, the latest wince machines are crammed with splashy options like full-color displays and audio. running a slimmed-down version of windows 98, taking voice commands, and opening email attachments, these pdas aspire to be mini desktops. new software from audible makes it easy to download news and books. yet anemic battery life is a constant problem, with wince machines averaging just 10 hours between recharges.despite wince's alluring attributes, many microserfs - such as consumer applications product manager lily li - have admitted to carrying a palm. the palm os is fast (it doesn't have desktop envy). it forgoes gonzo features for sleek design. it's still the only device that syncs with the mac. and the interface remains mind-bogglingly elegant.the question isn't whether you should buy a pda;
