(usai), is no stranger himself to risky deals and gambles. leaving abc and paramount studios in the '80s, he built up the then unknown fox television into a formidable threat to the big three networks. in the early '90s he once again ventured into uncharted waters with qvc and the home shopping network. in the last few years he's also acquired usa networks (valued at us$1.6 billion) along with ticketmaster online citysearch (tmcs), an online city guide.last month, diller's usa networks made an $18 billion offer for lycos, the fourth most-popular network of internet sites, which is in the process of acquiring wired digital. after an initial market hullabaloo that sent usa's stock skyrocketing, wall street -- after taking a closer look at the deal -- tempered its enthusiasm, and usa's share price has dropped considerably. diller, however, has never let investor skepticism stop him from plunging ahead into uncharted waters.buying lycos culminates \"seven years of straggling thought\" for diller. \"it also made solid business sense,\" he said. by combining ticketmaster online, citysearch, and home shopping network's massive sales infrastructure with lycos' sizable user base, he's betting that selling goods directly to consumers, rather than simply selling advertising, is going to be the commerce engine of the future.diller repeated the importance of laying a solid commercial infrastructure to make money on the web.\"speed is a matter of our times ... it changes our lives, but process builds our lives,\" he said. \"process is the actual work: 'carving nature at its joints,' as plato said.\"he also believes that relying solely on advertising is an obsolete model. \"there's a long slow arc of change to direct selling. it's vital to the new world order.\"diller is pragmatic about his relative inexperience as an online media mogul. \"i'm a pretender,\" he said, \"but i have great intentions and enthusiasm.\" he also possesses considerable resources and a solid money-making structure, enabling him to wait for lycos and the internet to become profitable.hence his mantra today: \"time will tell.\" and he believes the irrational exuberance of internet stocks and company acquisitions will inevitably calm itself. \"the iron laws of selling always win over time.\"audience reaction was generally positive to diller's speech. \"it's good, because he's looking at larger elements in the convergence of real companies, and beyond the hype,\" said beth lewand, online director for strategic planning and new business development for comedy central.\"he also brings confidence, as traditional media companies realize that there's value in online content,\" she said.incorporating lycos into diller's media empire was inevitable, diller said. \"hsn and ticketmaster are pieces of the same jigsaw puzzle.\" with the massive support structure of hsn, ticketmaster, and citysearch for getting local content and drawing consumers, lycos was a final piece of the picture. it gives him a portal, and more importantly, once again makes barry diller a player."}
