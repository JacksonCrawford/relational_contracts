(one of his favorite beneficiaries is targesome, a startup biotech company working on cancer treatments.) and, yes, he likes his quirky causes. he gives to the university of arizona's spacewatch project, which seeks to identify asteroids that could strike the earth.\"it's cheap collision insurance,\" kirsch cracks. \"i pay more for my acura nsx.\"demographically, this crowd is young - the average age looks to be late thirties - so they're in a position to give big for a long time. among those present are ebay billionaire jeff skoll, mkirisk chair rod beckstrom, and laura lauder, wife of venture capitalist gary lauder. overall, their reaction to kirsch's pep talk is positive. the event snares 10 new partners for kirsch's group and rakes in pledges of $125,000.that's just a hint at the potential, given the unprecedented wealth surging out of the valley these days. but like kirsch, the new breed of high tech philanthropists want to reinvent the art of generosity. they share his sense that simply giving money away is too passive and uninvolved. they want to lend business expertise, identify and support \"social entrepreneurs\" hungry to shake up the nonprofit world, and quantify their results. in short, they want to create a new kind of charity. but they don't call it that. they call it venture philanthropy.sitting at the head of a shiny conference table in the mayfield fund's menlo park office, gib myers explains why he missed fong's garden party earlier in the week. he was hosting a dinner of his own, at palo alto's il fornaio, for the advisers and members of the entrepreneurs' foundation, another venture philanthropy group. like fong, the 57-year-old myers is a partner at the well-regarded vc firm, but since last year, when he began focusing on the foundation full-time, he's been earning his cred as a leader in the first wave of \"vp.\"as myers practices it, venture philanthropy involves taking equity in promising new tech startups, watching the value go up, and then investing the money in entrepreneurial nonprofits. he and members of the entrepreneurs' foundation (fledgling companies like ramp networks and guy kawasaki's garage.com, as well as other blue-chip vcs like brook byers of kleiner perkins) are coming up with novel ways to track the effectiveness of their donations, much as they track their rois. the entrepreneurs' foundation also seeks to get its member companies engaged in projects like painting low-income apartments and tutoring students. this, myers says, excites the valley's young philanthropists in a way that scribbling a check to the salvation army never will.\"all of this is venture capital 101,\" myers says. \"but there's been nobody doing it in the philanthropic world until now.\"crucial to vp 101 are the same financial instruments that build personal fortunes in high tech: stock options and ipos. it's relatively painless for paper millionaires to give away shares - especially shares they can't cash in themselves because of sec or company restrictions - and prepublic companies can afford to be generous with options, too. armed with a powerpoint presentation, myers has wrung about $100,000 each in stock options from 36 companies. seven of these are preparing to go public. at press time, the fund's fortunes had risen to an estimated $3.5 million.meanwhile, a few internet companies are already doing this on their own. in 1998, when ebay was preparing for its ipo, founder pierre omidyar and jeff skoll, the company's vice president of strategic planning and analysis, decided to set aside 107,250 shares of stock to create the ebay foundation. \"the investment bankers weren't wild about the idea,\" skoll says, \"but we were just really firm about doing it.\"last winter, the ebay foundation began making investments out of an endowment that had rapidly grown to $30 million. one of the early \"investees\" was college kids, a group that helps low-income children get prepared for the challenges of pursuing higher education. skoll is now counseling several prepublic companies on how to set up similar foundations.elsewhere, other energetic vps have been kicking up dust. in seattle, a group of young entrepreneurs led by aldus founder paul brainerd helped form the social venture partners, a model for sv2. the group has attracted 177 partners - about half of them from microsoft - who each put at least $5,000 a year into a kitty. a member committee decides which community groups to invest in. the partners take a hands-on approach, similar to venture capitalists, in working with literacy organizations, elementary schools, and mentoring programs. they negotiate leases, help agencies get online, and offer advice on marketing and branding. in may, svp held its largest meeting to date, with 225 people attending; the gathering was held in the recital room of the seattle symphony's benaroya hall.__ \"all of this is venture capital 101,\" myers says. \"but there's been nobody doing it in the philanthropic world until now.\" __\"we're not afraid of taking risks,\" says brainerd. \"we want to create as big an impact as we can with our money - and use our brainpower, not just our checkbooks.\"a founding manifesto of today's venture philanthropy was a 1997 harvard business review article called \"virtuous capital: what foundations can learn from venture capitalists,\" written by christine letts, a lecturer at harvard's john f. kennedy school of government, and two coauthors, a consultant named william ryan and outward bound ceo allen grossman. letts says that when she first organized a series of seminars in 1995 and 1996 for fund-raisers and the business leaders who supported them, \"we were trying to divine why it was so difficult to create strong nonprofits.\"because of the seminars, letts says, she became interested in the differences in how nonprofits and private-sector businesses grow. she decided that some practices of vcs - like helping management develop and execute strategies, measuring investment performance, and maintaining a long-term relationship - would benefit both foundations (the organizations that make grants) and nonprofits (the organizations that deploy grant money). she saw, for example, that in the five states with the most active foundations, only 5.2 percent of all grants were awarded for more than a year, forcing nonprofits to continuously raise money. in contrast, venture capitalists typically maintain relationships with companies in their portfolio for five years or more. they also provide startups with a large portion of their funding needs at the outset so ceos can focus on developing the organization.\"clearly, foundations and venture capitalists face similar challenges,\" the article stated, \"selecting the most worthy recipients of funding, relying on young organizations to implement ideas, and being accountable to the third party whose funds they are investing.\" the piece pointed out that while venture capital firms had a strong track record of launching \"'moon rockets' - ventures that produce a big payoff with a successful initial public offering,\" traditional foundations were more risk-averse and thus had fewer stellar successes to boast about. what letts et al. didn't anticipate was how much this analysis would appeal to high tech's young millionaire class, eager to do their part but wary of bureaucracies.\"i started this because i don't think philanthropy works,\" says vanessa kirsch (no relation to steve kirsch), founder of new profit. this boston-based venture philanthropy group is managing a $4 million fund with help from the area's venture cap and high tech do-gooders and is building a $20 million trust. a fast starter, new profit recently moved from its cramped one-room office in boston's red cross building to more spacious digs donated by the monitor company, a consulting firm that will also give free counsel to the social entrepreneurs new profit supports.earlier in her career, kirsch launched what she calls an \"urban peace corps\" group in washington, dc, called public allies and expanded it to seven cities. \"traditional philanthropy and grant making isn't based on performance and results,\" kirsch adds. \"when i was running public allies, i discovered it was nearly impossible to get money for things that are successful. the mentality of foundations is, 'this organization isn't doing well, so let's give them more money.' i could only get money for public allies programs in cities that were running a deficit. that's backward.\"kirsch and her fellow vp pioneers say that funding should help buttress successes rather than prolong failures. their rallying cry is that \"checkbook philanthropy\" is not enough, a sentiment sandy lerner expresses with her usual candor.\"the problem with older charities is that after a while it's like a company. you get wedded to one approach,\" lerner says. \"giving to the world wildlife fund is a total waste of money. all of it goes to overhead. just like united way. my partner len and i are big believers in leverage. we look for projects with extremely low overhead. we try to empower people who take unorthodox approaches. we look for people who are going to get dirty.\"to identify the people who are going to get dirty, the vps say, you can either be as directly involved as lerner is in selecting your beneficiaries, or you can develop more rigorous measures of nonprofit performance.in san francisco, the roberts enterprise development fund - created by george roberts, one of the founders of the new york investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts - has been a pioneer in trying to develop vc-like ways of measuring the returns on its \"investment\" in social entrepreneurs. one project is juma ventures, which recruits high-risk urban youth to work in ben & jerry's shops.\"we're kind of the lunatic fringe of venture philanthropy, taking financial metrics and applying them in the social sector,\" says jed emerson, the roberts fund's executive director. \"too many nonprofits are concerned with getting grants - not what they do with them. and too many foundations are oriented more toward giving grants, rather than tracking the outcomes and what you're trying to achieve with that money.\"the roberts fund recently hired a full-time financial analyst from j. p. morgan to help build models for determining what emerson calls \"social return on investment.\" juma ventures, for example, employs 71 youths, all from a san francisco neighborhood with high unemployment, in part-time positions. the roberts fund closely tracks how many of the youths drop out of the training program, how long the others stay in their positions, and how many eventually make a transition to better jobs. the fund also estimates how much its investees, like juma, save government human-services organizations. the fund's managers say that another organization that it underwrites, rubicon programs - which employs homeless and disabled people in various landscaping, janitorial, and food-service businesses - will save local, state, and federal agencies at least $6 million over 10 years. \"we basically view all of our philanthropy as a form of investment,\" emerson says. \"we want to know what impact it has.\"__ vp pioneers say that funding should buttress success, not prolong failure. nothing good can be achieved through \"checkbook philanthropy.\" __not everyone in philanthropy is ecstatic about vp. as letts acknowledges, \"a small subset of the foundation world believes our ideas are evil.\" some of the old guard finds the new guard a bit smug. \"one would like to think that social problems are solvable in the same way that business and science problems are solvable - but they aren't,\" says bruce sievers, who, as executive director of the walter and elise haas fund in san francisco, supervises a $225 million endowment from members of the family that owns levi strauss & co. the haas fund supports arts organizations, education programs, human services such as local clinics, and ethics curricula.in 1997, sievers wrote a harsh reply - a countermanifesto, really - to letts' harvard business review article for foundation news & commentary. says sievers, \"we have huge social problems that we've dumped zillions of dollars into, and we're still dealing with them. there's a little hubris involved when you have these technology millionaires saying they know how to fix social problems - that it's just a mess because people aren't disciplined enough, not paying enough attention. well, they haven't been immersed in the complexities of these social issues.\"sievers is particularly skeptical of efforts to measure the roi of social-services organizations. \"how do you measure a goal like reducing youth violence?\" he asks. \"there are so many variables involved that it's impossible to tell if your mentoring program is actually making a difference. there's just an endless list of causalities.\"some high tech philanthropists share sievers' concern. harry saal, founder of network general (now network associates), points out that it's inherently difficult to measure whether, say, an art museum is contributing to a city's well-being. saal, who serves as president of cultural initiatives/silicon valley, says, \"it's easy to measure butts in seats, and not as easy to measure cultural vitality.\"even peter hero, the appropriately named president of the community foundation silicon valley and central node of the valley's philanthropic network, has some reservations about vp, despite the fact that hero's group sponsored the launch of sv2. hero points out that vcs don't have the best reputation for being \"patient money.\"says hero, \"one question i have is, will the donors have the sustained level of curiosity and involvement to ride through the periods of anxiety and ambivalence that all nonprofits go through? will they tolerate the slow and messy process of arriving at decisions? will it be too democratic and not results-oriented enough for them?\"hero nevertheless seems to believe that over time, the radical stance of venture philanthropy will mellow. \"i think people will discover that most of these nonprofits are very well managed and well run,\" he says. \"a lot of the jargon will begin to melt away, and these people, in their sixties and seventies, will begin giving money the way dave packard did: if people in the community are cold and hungry, you go out and help. you give them the money, and don't have all this stuff about business plans and investments.\"most members of high tech's philanthropic old guard express skepticism about the \"newness\" of the new philanthropy yet take the hype as a good omen.\"doesn't every philanthropist want to contribute money to people who are smart, bright, driven, and motivated?\" says bill krause of the younger generation's insistence on business-savvy nonprofits. krause, former chair and ceo of 3com and storm technology, is now a private investor and founder (along with his wife gay) of the krause foundation, which focuses on systemic change in education. \"it's early in their chronology,\" krause says of the vp whippersnappers. \"all good things happen in time.\"\"it takes a lot of energy and attention to give money away well,\" says bob metcalfe, founder of 3com and a friend of krause's. metcalfe describes himself as \"silicon valley old money.\" typical of the pre-internet generation of philanthropists, he's willing to watch his successors mature as donors. \"it takes time to learn the sad fact that if you don't give it away, the government is going to take it away,\" metcalfe observes. besides, he says, \"many of these people are still busy running their businesses.\"to krause, metcalfe, and others, venture philanthropy may be another case of the younger generation eager to prove that they have their own, better ways of doing things - but more power to them if they can make a real difference. certainly, the directors of the social venture partners think they will.\"we're building a model here,\" says paul shoemaker, an ex-microsoft executive who now serves as executive director of seattle's svp. \"it feels good because it's extremely interesting to build something new.\" reflecting on the debate over social roi, he says, \"the notion i bristle at is that i have nothing to learn from successful foundations, or that either we're right or they're right. the truth is, we're both a little right.\"\"this is a bow wave,\" says scott oki, another former microsoft exec on svp's board. \"we're seeing quite a bit of philanthropy happening already, but what's the potential impact from the high tech industry 5, 10, 20 years from now? it's going to be breathtaking. but to get there you need not a handful of people setting examples, you need hundreds.\""}
