interpret internet quarterly earnings reports. are the numbers too good to be true?", "author": "reuters", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "10.11.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "internet investors seeking some hard data on the performance of their dot com companies may have a hard time finding it in the earnings reports coming out over the next few weeks. if the current earnings season is anything like recent quarters, most companies will report at least two different earnings figures, along with several measures of traffic to their web sites. it all amounts to a data overload critics say is at best a lot of material to wade through and at worst a distortion of the bottom line.internet companies seeking to put their results in the best light will often report a net income or loss, but then put the focus on a different income number, which excludes \"unusual charges,\" and can mean a difference of millions of dollars.yahoo took this approach last week, when it reported a net third quarter profit of us$14.9 million or five cents a share, but highlighted its net income before merger-related charges of $40.4 million or 14 cents per share.by all accounts, yahoo's numbers were stellar no matter how you looked at them, and the practice of separating unusual charges from net income is a standard accounting procedure.internet companies may be especially justified in isolating unusual items from operating results, because they are young and growing and need to invest aggressively to build viable businesses. people often buy internet stocks on the basis of their future potential rather than current performance.still, some accounting experts and industry analysts say internet companies list far too many normal businesses expenses as unusual or extraordinary items.\"the word 'extraordinary' gets misused,\" says chuck hill, director of research at first call/thompson financial, which tracks company earnings against analyst earnings estimates.\"they're throwing everything but the kitchen sink in with the unusual items,\" adds hill, who says this liberal accounting often produces an inflated operating income figure.one particular write-off that has been widely criticized is \"in-process r&d,\" a vague term that companies may stretch to include acquisition costs. already this year the securities and exchange commission has required some big internet companies like yahoo and america online to restate earnings because of in-process r&d charges deemed excessive.companies have always accounted for acquisitions by amortizing the goodwill, or the amount over book value paid. but internet companies that have high-priced stock to use for currency often make acquisitions at millions over book value, and are left with massive amounts of goodwill to write down, or amortize.rather than amortizing the amount over 30 or 40 years like it was done in the past, high-tech companies often choose to condense it into a shorter period. this produces a large charge, which they then instruct investors to exclude from operating income.bob walberg, an analyst at briefing.com in chicago noted in a recent research report for example, that athome's staggering us$7.2 billion acquisition of the internet portal excite earlier this year, means that it will need to deduct $153 million in goodwill every quarter for 10 years. to put this in perspective, the combined company exciteathome had revenues of just over $100 million in the latest quarter.\"it is extremely rare for a company to have goodwill deductions in excess of total revenues,\" wrote walberg, adding that covering such charges puts exceptional pressure on the company to grow its sales and earnings as fast as it can.excluding unusual items is not the only way earnings are inflated. cnet was criticized in a recent quarter for failing to exclude a large gain on the sale of securities. the money made in the stock sale took cnet from a net loss to an operating gain, even though most accountants say such a one-time sale is clearly an unusual item that is not a part of normal operations.willing as companies are to exclude costs that will reduce earnings, they take a different view of unusual gains that could work in their favor.other practices have been questioned as well. some companies, like salon.com have been known to include in revenues ads placed on their site that they never sold, but only exchanged for placing one of their own ads on another web site. priceline.com records in its revenues the full retail value of the plane and hotel tickets it auctions, rather than the often reduced price they drew at auction.eric von der porten a hedge fund manager in san carlos, california, who has a short position on some internet stocks, says some of the blame falls on industry analysts. they commonly accept the company line, reading earnings the way the company presents them, rather than probing deeper.\"analysts have certainly helped feed the frenzy,\" he says. i question whether there is any independence left.\"while all these accounting quirks usually spelled out somewhere in the income statement or the footnotes, they rarely make the headline or the sound bite.first call's hill says companies may reason they can temporary inflate earnings since they are young and have dizzying growth prospects. the danger, he says, is that if business doesn't improve quickly \"things are eventually going to catch up with them.\"copyright"}
