gave consent to linda tripp to tap their phone conversations.", "author": "reuters", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "12.16.1999 12:00 PM", "text": "ellicott city, maryland -- monica lewinsky testified in public for the first time since the scandal over her affair with president clinton and said she never gave her ex-friend linda tripp permission to tape their telephone conversations. at a hearing thursday to determine whether tripp can be prosecuted for alleged violations of a maryland wiretap law, the 26-year-old former white house intern said she gave tripp no permission to record the phone chats in which they discussed lewinsky's relationship with clinton, which led to clinton's impeachment.she also said she was frightened when newsweek magazine published an article in february 1998 containing excerpts from a conversation she had with tripp barely a month earlier.\"it terrified me because i was concerned about the privacy of my relationship being revealed,\" lewinsky said without mentioning the president's name during an hour of testimony in howard county circuit court, a few miles from tripp's maryland home.tripp, a former white house secretary, secretly taped their phone conversations from october to late december, and turned more than 20 hours of recordings over to the office of former independent counsel kenneth starr in january 1998, just days before news of the scandal exploded into headlines.but in maryland, it is a felony to tape-record telephone conversations unless all parties consent, making lewinsky's word on consent a key piece of prosecution testimony.\"i had not consented,\" she told carmen shepard, deputy state attorney general, from the witness stand.until thursday, lewinsky had testified about the white house sex scandal only before starr's closed grand jury proceedings and in a videotape presented at clinton's senate trial.tripp, who did not appear in court, was indicted last july on two counts charging her with taping the december conversation and then sharing it with newsweek. she could face five years in prison and us$10,000 in fines on each count if convicted.before the case can reach trial on 18 january, however, the state must prove that its evidence is not tainted by the starr investigation findings. whether they succeed depends on howard county circuit judge diane leasure, who is expected to rule after testimony in a weeklong pretrial hearing concludes on friday.lewinsky, who appeared under a state subpoena, told the court that she was able to identify the december tape and its date purely by her own recollection of events surrounding the conversation, and not on information supplied later by starr.\"this is the real turning point where she (tripp) said she was definitely going to disclose my relationship (with clinton),\" said lewinsky.days before the conversation, she and tripp had been subpoenaed to give testimony in paula corbin jones' sexual harassment suit against clinton. on the day of the conversation, she had met with clinton friend vernon jordan, and a day later she attended her own farewell party at the pentagon.\"that conversation was -- there were certain aspects of it that were marked in my mind, etched in my mind, because it was a pretty frightening time for me,\" she said.under cross-examination by tripp attorney joe murtha, lewinsky maintained her composure and even joked with the defense lawyer, but soon showed signs of stress. at one point, she asked the judge for a 10 minute recess.murtha produced a 1998 letter to state investigators from one of her attorneys which said the december conversation could have occurred on the 22nd or the 23rd. but the defense lawyer failed to get her to admit that her memory had later been influenced by dealings with starr's staff, her reading of his report to congress or work on the book, monica's story.\"the sense of my first recollection in seeing the newsweek article was that this was my conversation, this is when it happened, these are the reasons it happened,\" she said.murtha did score a victory for tripp by getting lewinsky to acknowledge that she may have led state investigators to tripp confidante mary katherine friedrich after learning the woman's surname from starr's staff.friedrich, who at the time worked for the national security council, allegedly told state authorities that tripp played a lewinsky tape for her, and asked friedrich if she should erase part of the recording in which tripp swore at her daughter for knocking over a christmas tree. given lewinsky's admission, the state was unlikely to be able to use friedrich as a witness.\"we are pleased with the information we withdrew from ms. lewinsky,\" murtha later told reporters, adding that tripp was confident the case would not reach trial.once her testimony was over, lewinsky sighed audibly before being hustled out of the courtroom to a waiting van.copyright"}
