and his father's iron grip on the family legacy. history may one day prove that richard li was the most subversive influence in 21st-century asia, the instigator - pace lenin, mao, and many another failed \"liberator\" of asia's masses - of a true people's revolution.yet here, in the waning months of the 20th century, ensconced at a polished dark wooden table in his private corporate dining room in a gleaming hong kong skyscraper, one could be forgiven for overlooking that possibility.the framed prints of turn-of-the-century hong kong and the magisterial hush in the heart of this endlessly honking city befit a scion of asia's establishment. as they should, for richard li, the second son of li ka-shing, the continent's most prominent tycoon and the world's 19th-richest man, is an heir to a $10 billion fortune.but li, a child of hong kong who was schooled as a teenager in california and began his adult working life in canada, is aiming to blow up the old order in asia - and in his family, too - by building an empire out of the continent's growing middle class and striving poor. the best known of a new breed of steely, profit-seeking, supremely pragmatic asian entrepreneurs who in many ways think and act like westerners, he is devising a way to construct the world's biggest broadband pipeline and to extend it to the hundreds of millions of ordinary asians - many of them living in dirt-floored dwellings - whose greatest worldly possession is their television set.in a joint venture with intel he has been driving quietly but feverishly for the past year, li plans to give these people the opportunity to turn their tvs into fully functioning network computers and to send them what he calls an \"unimaginable array of applications and quality information,\" the best the west has to offer, translated into asian languages. this, li says, will provide ordinary asians the guidance they need on agricultural techniques, small-business finance, weather forecasting, and family planning to compete with the west. by putting economic power in the hands of ordinary asians - by allowing, say, a rural indian weaver to sell his textiles to a global market via the internet - li's revolution could also severely challenge the patriarchal, old-boy-network form of capitalism that helped place his family among the world's wealthiest.\"the power of information is going to correlate with prosperity more than ever in asia,\" says the 32-year-old li. he presses a button just to the left of his butter knife, calling his butler to bring him juice. \"whoever can master information,\" he continues, \"who can screen what is good from what's bad and make the best use of it, will be those who will prosper the most in society.\"the word freedom hangs in the air like a coda to this speech. but li doesn't say it. he exalts free markets, free trade, and free speech. he even talks about freedom of information. but freedom as a proud, simple, politically charged noun, with all it implies about self-determination and self-government - that word seems stuck in his throat.i am determined to tease it from him. when he defines convergence as \"the fusing of communications and entertainment and information and commerce,\" i see my chance.\"what about politics and power?\" i ask.silence.hanging on the wall just over his smartly suspendered shoulders are framed photographs of li with an atlas of old-world power, a gallery ranging from margaret thatcher and henry kissinger to lee kuan yew, the iron-fisted former prime minister of singapore, a respected friend of the li family. notorious for the harassment and jailing of political opponents during his long reign, lee in his retirement still warns against the corrupting influence of the western-style democracy and individualism that richard li, if his plan to wire asia succeeds, will inevitably bring to his continent.i try again.\"what,\" i ask, \"do you think will be the ultimate effect on asia's repressive regimes of equal access to quality information that you plan to bring to hundreds of millions of ordinary asians?\"nothing.\"jobs, gates, ellison, mcnealy - they'll all tell you how it should be done. but only two people really get it - bill gates and richard li.\"once you get to know richard li - to learn about his background, his vision, his father, and his older brother victor, whom many speculate is his rival for family supremacy; about his apparent determination to live up to and, if possible, surpass the old man in the quality and impact of his worldly accomplishments - you begin to realize there are many such pregnant lacunae. these are the key to his character and the paradox that defines him.one more time.\"i mean,\" i say, \"a lot of governments in asia have flatly said they fear the corrupting influence of western culture on their societies. like china, malaysia, and singapore. they're worried specifically about the internet.\"li cuts me off.\"those forces have to be balanced and mitigated,\" he says curtly. \"can we just leave it at that?\"the information revolution has already begun in asia. but so far, instead of a full-fledged assault, it's been limited to a few skirmishes instigated by specialized forward units, including star tv, a pan-asian satellite-television network richard li built between 1990 and 1993. star beamed mtv and american soap operas down over a third of the globe's landmass and two-thirds of its population. call it tacky (and many did), but the service nevertheless triggered a vast cultural shift, injecting a massive dose of western popular entertainment into, at last count, more than 50 countries. it also won li independence from his father, whose $62.5 million loan to his younger son was paid off and then some when richard sold the network to rupert murdoch - in two separate deals in 1993 and 1995 - for a total of $950.5 million.now li is planning to use a substantial portion of the profits to mount a full-scale information invasion in asia. currently, fewer than 7 million of the continent's citizens - its richest and most privileged - regularly use the web, often by finding ingenious ways to bypass government proxy servers and snooping censors. (nua internet surveys reported that in january net users worldwide numbered 151 million, 60 million of whom were in the us.) but with li's asian marketing savvy hitched to the technological know-how of intel in a joint venture called pacific convergence corporation (pcc), li intends a three-step process to deliver the internet into the remotest villages and farthest outposts of mountain, desert, and steppe.step one entails building a satellite-to-cable distribution system to deliver interactive digital-television services to homes not yet outfitted with telephones. step two entails mass-marketing a cheap set-top box to turn asia's tv sets into emailing, web-surfing powerhouses. and step three requires creating, customizing, and then pumping into these tv sets and pcs millions of terabytes of highest-quality information - the gold, silks, and spices of our day, brought to asia, rather than extracted from it.the money committed so far is peanuts. reportedly li and intel have investments of $25 million and $10 million respectively. but the upside potential for spending is breathtaking. \"the scale of this thing will be bigger than anything that exists in the world,\" says avram miller, intel's business-development chief and top long-term strategist and planner. \"we have to build an end-to-end network architecture that is unique. we might spend a billion dollars on a project that wouldn't be as important as this one. the us represents only 4.5 percent of the world's population. asia is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. china will become our second most important market.\"we had to make a bet in asia,\" he adds. \"we made it with pcc.\"that wager is well evident in silicon valley. although li and intel have avoided publicity since quietly announcing their joint venture in march 1998, both sides have spent the past year hiring furiously for, and brainstorming nonstop about, a project executives of both companies believe will carry on for decades.li has sent several of his top consiglieres to live in the valley, close to intel's headquarters in santa clara. intel, signaling the importance it places on the project, assigned bill howe, the exec who developed the company's now sizable japanese operations through the 1980s and early '90s, to work full-time as head of the us side of the venture. the company has rented an enormous amount of floor space in sunnyvale, a 15-minute drive from intel's home office. in it, cubicles are rapidly being filled with bright-eyed twenty- and thirtysomething computer technologists, graphic artists, and new media specialists.both sides are keeping mum on the target size of their venture and on the desired mix of staff. meanwhile, all sales and marketing work is being done by pcc staff in the hong kong headquarters.set to launch late this year at the earliest (the battered economies of asia permitting), li's broadband product will at first glance look like services being offered in the united states, such as the cable-distributed @home or microsoft's webtv, which is delivered over phone lines. when the customer's television set is turned on, a gateway screen will display the service's brand name (which has not yet been disclosed), and a menu of choices will appear. these will include email, home banking, home shopping, and the internet, all to be accessed by clicking on a remote control.behind the surface similarity of richard li's product to western offerings lies a world of difference, though. his digital service will package western content in asian garb. local-language videos and business and financial news tailored to specific markets are being developed. a voicemail function is being designed for the majority of asians who can't type email because they write with ideograms or phonograms. mindful of the millions of asian parents who spend considerable amounts to educate their children, li's staff is developing interactive educational services, including distance-learning programs taught by professors at leading western universities. interactive programs for virtual communities of business and trade groups, mah-jongg players, and overseas chinese relatives are also being explored because of the emphasis many asian cultures place on building large business, social, and family networks.li's champions believe his convergence project will, as he hopes, recast the asian economies. \"he's a truly visionary thinker,\" says scott smith, a silicon valley investment banker who has advised li on acquisitions for the project. \"the reason people overlook him is because he's asian. people don't value what they don't understand. steve jobs, bill gates, larry ellison, scott mcnealy - they'll all tell you how it should be done. but there are only two people who really get it, and they are bill gates and richard li. do i think he can create a consumer market for this business in asia? you bet.\"but doubters say that li and intel are digging a black hole for billions of investment dollars.building a satellite-to-cable distribution network over such an awesome landmass, they say, is a quixotic fantasy. how can richard li contemplate running the internet into villages that don't even have running water? doesn't he realize that most asians have never seen a computer, don't read english, and can't type? for a return on investment, li and intel will wait decades, the skeptics say.politically and culturally, too, his project appears on a collision course with the tightly sealed, family-dominated power network that exerts control over most asian economies. that network has maintained its grip on the region in large part because of the way information has traditionally flowed in eastern cultures.\"in the western world, the individual is valued more than the group, so information flows from the group to the individual; in asia it's the opposite,\" explains james liu, ceo of the hong kong industrial technology centre corporation, which funds high tech start-ups. \"here, information flows from the remote regions to the inner circle. in the us, each individual has the need to access publicly available information, while in asia you get information through the old-boy network - through your father and mother, brothers and sisters and cousins.''it's called guanxi, the chinese word for \"connections,\" and it's as good a name as any for asia's old power structure. (see \"he's got guanxi!\" wired 7.02, page 122.) guanxi has nothing to do with the inherent quality of facts, of objective information, or of the truth. rather, guanxi is about the quality of rumors, about being close to the seat of power. the information revolution promises to blow up guanxi and replace it with objective facts and analysis available to everyone, everywhere. richard li knows that. indeed, he openly proclaims that in the future, the richest man in asia will be the one not with the best guanxi, but with the best information. he sees the process already begun in china.\"the leadership in china has changed dramatically over the past five years,\" li says in the posh oxbridge accent he picked up from his childhood english tutor, one mrs. nightingale, who taught him every day after school in hong kong from ages 3 to 13. \"now, it's a merit system. before, it was a political system. if you were a diehard communist, you could move up. if you weren't, you couldn't. now it's completely different. in the last five years, it's education, exams, how well you did at school, that really matters.\"in striving to eradicate guanxi, li - though he could never openly admit it - is putting himself squarely on the side of the democracy advocates who have been waging a war of words with not only china but also hong kong's tycoon class, which toadies to beijing in order to sustain its access to china's giant markets. for the average hong kong businessman, the risks of speaking out for freedom are quite real, as clothing retailer and publisher jimmy lai learned in 1994, when he called china's then-premier li peng a \"turtle's egg\" - a local slur - and had his stores in beijing closed. (see \"media typhoon,\" wired 2.12, page 82.)in richard li's case, the risks are magnified a thousandfold by his lineage. it's not just a chain of clothing stores that's at stake, but a vast property, financial, and retailing empire that runs deep into mainland china, hong kong, and southeast asia. relations with his father, who has epitomized the go-along, get-along approach of the tycoon class, also hang in the balance.li's father is more than a tycoon - he is the horatio alger, henry ford, and henry kissinger of hong kong all in one.i start to ask him about this apparent conflict between family and the prodigal, about the contradictions between father and son. he glances with imperious disapproval at the list of 32 written queries his press office had requested in advance. he grins. \"can we,\" he asks, in a tone that makes clear it's less a question than an order, \"skip those questions with an 'f' in them?\"it is often said in hong kong that of every dollar spent, 5 cents goes into the pocket of li ka-shing.the son of a poor schoolteacher from the southern chinese port city of chaozhou, li ka-shing immigrated to hong kong with his family in 1940 after japanese bombing raids closed his father's schoolhouse. forced to quit school and work as a clerk in a watch shop after his father died unexpectedly in 1943, he later graduated to selling watchbands and belts for a plastics factory, where he rose to general manager. finally, in 1950, he became the company's owner.known as hong kong's king of plastic flowers in the 1960s, k. s. saw greater long-term opportunities in real estate, the field in which he made his second fortune in the 1970s. in 1979 he took a stride into hong kong's history books with his dramatic takeover of hutchison whampoa, one of the original british-owned hongs, or trading companies, that dominated business, social, and political life throughout the territory's 156-year colonial history.today, the two flagship companies controlled by k. s., cheung kong and hutchison whampoa, are giant conglomerates with extensive holdings in virtually every major sector of the hong kong economy, including property, shipping and ports, energy, telecommunications, food processing and distribution, and hotels and retailing. his holdings in mainland china are no less extensive. he personally bankrolled the building and staffing of a university in the city of shantou and has invested in dozens of ventures in key industries throughout southern china.during china's fitful drive to liberalization, k. s. became much more than a tycoon - he transformed into a public man and political figure, the horatio alger, henry ford, and henry kissinger of hong kong all in one, able to work with both the british colonial masters and the mainland communist leadership. he never publicly rocked the boat, and he frequently acted to stabilize relations between the tiny territory and its giant neighbor. in the early 1980s he was a close personal adviser to deng xiaoping, counseling him on the best ways to alter hong kong's political, judicial, and business systems once the territory reverted to chinese rule in 1997. after the tiananmen square massacre of 1989, li's public confidence in china's leaders helped stem a massive exodus of investment, both foreign and local, from hong kong. news and rumors about li's every business move regularly send the hang seng index of leading stocks gyrating. in recent months, for example, li has found hong kong government regulatory reforms not to his liking and publicly wondered \"if hong kong's past harmonious environment was being lost, whether our excellent fundamentals were disappearing.\" that comment unleashed a flood of media attention, investor hand-wringing, and public debate on the question of hong kong's economic viability and long-term prospects.midway into this extraordinary life, richard li was born, the second of two sons. he and victor, three years his senior, lived privileged childhoods designed to prepare them for life at the very pinnacle of asia's business elite. at dinner every night, k. s. would discuss with them the business deals and strategies he'd hatched that day - and very little else. the boys, sitting in small chairs at the side of the room, often watched their father run board meetings.at the age of 13, richard li's cozy life in hong kong came abruptly to an end when he was sent to high school in menlo park, california. li recalls those early days in the united states as the loneliest of his life. for spending money, he sold hamburgers at mcdonald's and caddied at a local golf course. today he remembers both experiences fondly as character forming.indeed, friends recall that much of his austerity at the time was self-imposed. \"he didn't want to be special,\" says todd bonner, a friend of li's at stanford. \"he had a condo, but he chose to live in a tiny dorm room on campus. he wanted to live a normal life. that's why we could become friends. he didn't act like the son of a billionaire.\"after taking a degree in computer engineering in 1987, li worked for three years managing funds at a small investment bank in toronto. one day in 1990, a call came from home: his father wanted him back in hong kong to work in the fund-management department of hutchison whampoa.li dutifully followed the call. but his willful side led him to another idea. hutchison had engaged in - and eventually abandoned - a battle to win a cable television license in the territory. li led a team of high-level executives who, meeting on weekends over a period of months, noticed that a telecom satellite, the westar vi, had become disabled and was orbiting unused. why not fix the broken satellite and use it to deliver television programs to hong kong viewers through small satellite dishes, he thought, and bypass the whole cable mess altogether? and since the satellite would shine down over all of asia, why not make it a pan-asian business at the same time?\"the most important argument i used to convince myself,\" li says, \"was that at the time you saw communism falling, socialism and protectionism and subsidies falling, all these ideas falling rapidly worldwide, and south asian countries were quickly adjusting to that.\" a pan-asian television service, he concluded, could ride that tide to success, simultaneously benefiting from the crumbling of cross-border trade barriers and hastening their dissolution, because television was itself a solvent.at first, most people outside li's small squad of brain trusters were skeptical. his father, too, was doubtful, friends say, but was persuaded to invest because the amount li wanted, $62.5 million, was small relative to his total fortune, and because he saw how the young man had rallied a team of hard-boiled executives around the idea.of the tens of millions of subscribers li envisioned signing up to his satellite service, most did not, in 1990, have cable connections. yet the rates of television ownership in asia were quite high because many asian governments had encouraged television's development as a centrally controlled propaganda tool. so while there are only three phones for every hundred people in asia, about 65 percent have access to tv.but even with all the salesmen these millions could buy, selling satellite tv door-to-door throughout asia was simply impossible. somehow, li figured, the self-generating powers of capitalism itself would have to be tapped.his key insight came when he noticed something happening shortly after star started beaming signals across the continent. people throughout asia, realizing that a television signal was streaming down from the sky, concluded that this nonstop rain of western media could translate into cash. it was free; it could be captured at very little cost and then resold to customers for a profit. by the thousands, then by the tens of thousands, these entrepreneurs did just that - bought a cheap satellite dish, a simple collection-and-redistribution unit called a head end, and a roll of copper cable wire. they strung the wires down the streets and through the trees and into their neighbors' homes, charged them a little bit, and then just sat back and collected the money as it came in every month.rather than fight this spontaneous eruption of entrepreneurship throughout asia, star piggybacked on it. in the manner of an operating-system company opening its source code to third-party software developers, the star sales force fanned out across the region to spread the message of their signal falling free from the sky. they offered engineering and support services to help local entrepreneurs set up the satellite dish, the head end, and the cable, and let them keep every subscription penny they could scrounge. star would make its money purely by assembling the largest possible audience and selling advertising to it.within three years, the company had enlisted some 70,000 \"cable wallahs\" in india alone. cable operators charged customers anywhere from $2 a month in china to $100 monthly in rich middle eastern countries. mtv was an early hit, and word spread among asia's male population that star movies more than occasionally offered electrifying, never-before-seen glimpses of womankind. bo derek's 10 became a killer app for star throughout asian markets.mtv was an early hit for star tv. bo derek's 10 became its killer app throughout asia.in the years he was building star, li drove his staff relentlessly, earning a reputation as hong kong's most arrogant, bullying boss. he was a brilliant but mercurial leader, a man whose intense enthusiasms and relentless pressure kept his executives sleeping overnight on cots in the bunkerlike offices and sometimes drove them to tears.li's micromanagement was legendary. he took calls from irate customers because he wanted his ear to the ground and interviewed the candidates for every one of star's first 400 positions - including three candidates for office tea lady. \"i thought she was a key hire, since she'd be good for company morale by keeping everyone's spirits up,\" he says. \"it was a mistake. i could have spent those minutes much better.\"kevin trzcinski, an early member of the star staff, remembers li barking orders to men twice his age over a pa system connecting li's private suite to other executive offices. yet trzcinski also remembers that many of the top executives were intensely loyal, enduring long separations from their families for the sake of the mission. \"it wasn't nice, it wasn't fuzzy, but it was damn good business,\" trzcinski says.that he kept his subordinates' loyalty through the torment speaks to li's human touch. todd bonner, an employee as well as a friend, says li is \"constantly working, parallel processing, pushing things forward a little bit at a time. but he's not a cold, calculating businessman. there's a strong element of compassion. he's very paternalistic and loyal to his people. he's always asking, 'what's up? what do you need? how can i help?'\" bonner's hobby is flying airplanes. once, for his birthday, li bought him a vintage world war ii fighter.within three years, star appeared to be a smashing success. in the spring of 1993, the company had 45 million viewers in 11 million homes and $300 million in advertising commitments from 360 advertisers. its monthly listings guide was the largest-circulation english-language publication in asia. the network's impact was occasionally subtle but always profound. in india, the network provoked a national debate on public morals and western cultural imperialism after millions began watching the daytime soap santa barbara, with its tales of business and sexual rivalries among some of california's wealthiest families. one day li fielded a call from an indian politician in a remote area. curiously, the man was not upset by the show's torrid kissing scenes, which had prompted rabid newspaper editorials. rather, this rural official, speaking on behalf of others in his region, was miffed that his constituents were reacting positively to the show's opening shot: a sweeping helicopter view of the palatial homes in the real santa barbara.\"the pro-communist, pro-subsidy-from-russia politicians had been telling indian voters outside of the big cities that 'americans tell you these things actually happen, but they're all lies, just stories!'\" li tells me, bursting with pride. \"but now the voters in rural india are asking questions: 'can you really simulate tens of hundreds of miles of house after house with swimming pools?' it's shocking to us, but they didn't know.\"in china, teenagers in shanghai and beijing, taking their cue from the newly available mtv, tore their jeans and spiked their hair and took to the streets to break-dance. i ask li about their rebelliousness. having spent a fair amount of time with him by now, i expect a defensive answer, something designed to reassure beijing's leaders that break dancing is, after all, a far cry from circulating treasonous broadsides. instead, surprisingly, li takes a baby step toward the political. \"it strengthened my belief,\" he says, \"that the global village will reduce misunderstanding and conflict in every way.\"yet for all its apparent success, star was losing money. while the company claimed total investment at $125 million over three years, most analysts guess the true figure was at least twice that, and say it probably lost close to $90 million a year. \"it was a half-baked business model, and it's still being baked,\" says kaushik shridharani, a media analyst with salomon smith barney in hong kong. \"the point of star tv was there was a lot of money to be made, but that hasn't happened yet.\"tensions frequently boiled over. a star story now fixed in legend has li squaring off one day with simon murray, the immaculate englishman who was then the managing director of hutchison whampoa and one of k. s.'s trusted lieutenants. incensed by something murray said, richard grabbed him by the lapels (so the story goes) and ordered, \"shut up!\" after a stare-down that lasted several moments, murray asked to be unhanded. li describes the story as colorful but simply not true. but the myth was set: richard li had faced down the man who ran his own father's company, and won.today, murray, who has a seat on li's company's board of directors, recalls the mythic incident with a laugh. \"we had our moments a little bit, but it wasn't 'showdown at the ok corral,'\" he says. \"when richard was young he was quite a precocious, bouncy guy, jubilant and inclined to be excitable on occasion. he had too much enthusiasm and energy.\"murray says li ka-shing indulged his younger son. \"k. s. was like a father who just shrugs,\" he says. but the family pressure was undoubtedly fierce. richard had to contend with regular visits from older colleagues and family friends bearing a message: give up on the whole silly idea of pan-asian satellite tv - the sooner the better. \"very senior people, much older executives, seasoned managers, would seek me out usually at night or at some social function - find me at the end of an 18-hour day when i could barely keep my eyes open - and explain in great detail all the reasons why star would never work,\" li says. \"they said it would lose money and hurt my career. i had many sleepless nights.\"li finally opted to sell, negotiating the final portion of the $950.5 million sale by himself with rupert murdoch and his lawyers aboard the media titan's mediterranean yacht. li has said he came to believe that his fiduciary responsibility to hutchison whampoa required him to sell his pan-asian satellite empire. but friends and colleagues contend that the sale of star had little to do with escaping a day of financial judgment and everything to do with his need to make a name for himself and break away from his father.midway through one of our conversations, i ask li whether that is true.\"at the time,\" he says, choosing his words carefully, \"i felt that i had to do something, whatever the opportunity, to make the rest of my life a little easier. so i thought, 'i'll sell it, prove a point, and get a break.' so i did, and i got a t-shirt. it says been there, done that.\" he then embarked on building an empire of his own.li's route of ascent in asia's business world has been, by necessity, markedly different from that of his older brother victor, to whom, it was assumed, the leadership of the family empire would naturally go. that left richard - whose dogged, fiery personality was more obviously a leadership style than the cool, diffident victor's - with limited options. one choice was to work for his brother - unlikely, friends say, given his supercompetitive personality. another option was eventually to take control of hutchison whampoa, one of li ka-shing's two flagship conglomerates.with star, though, richard effectively announced his decision to take a third path - one entirely his own. friends of the family say it was inevitable, that richard from his earliest days was argumentative and willful, causing his father to recognize in his second son an entrepreneurial fire very much like his own.\"richard was the one who argued the most,\" one friend says. \"he was the most and the least disciplined. but he was always the favorite. there is a huge amount of love there.\"publicly, li speaks very little of his brother, who finally did succeed k. s. this year. in part, this reflects their implicit rivalry, but it's also an eminently practical response to the realities of life in hong kong. burglaries at the mansions of hong kong's tycoons are so common that residents suffer from a siege mentality, surrounding their homes with ever higher walls and elaborate security systems and military-trained security guards. sometimes, the defenses are seriously breached. three years ago victor himself was kidnapped, and reportedly bound hand and foot and confined in a remote hut while the kidnappers negotiated a ransom directly with li ka-shing, who paid over $100 million for his release. the five kidnappers, led by a flamboyant gangster named big spender cheung tze-keung, were eventually captured; they were executed in december last year.the $950.5 million star sale gave richard a windfall to spend as he pleased. over the next four years he did just that. he opened his own enterprise - the pacific century group - and he bought stakes in companies that were as safe and stodgy as star had been risky and glamorous: tokyo real estate, an insurance company, et cetera. but friends say his heart was never wholly in these ventures. he knew these businesses were worth hundreds of millions, but not the billions he would need to establish an identity apart from his family.a legendary micromanager, li interviewed even the office tea lady. in hindsight, he says, \"i could have spent those minutes better.\"bored after the star sale, li toyed with other media ventures. \"he loves the media because it reaches the masses,\" bonner says. \"it excites him more than anything.\" (li even watches cnbc while in the shower, where he has a tv set mounted on the showerhead.)li became intrigued with the possibilities of interactivity in 1990 when he saw a demonstration of an interactive digital encyclopedia on cd-rom, in particular its vietnam war file. for the first time in his life, li, who was 2 years old at the time of the tet offensive, began to understand the vietnam war as a real event, even to feel some of the passions that it had stirred. by the mid-1990s, now surfing the net, he quickly grasped that by using the same business model that had propelled star's growth, he could build an enterprise around interactivity that was capable of the global growth he wanted.his inspiration was to beam a broadband digital signal from a satellite to cable distributors around asia - indeed, to the same distributors li helped get into the business during the star years. these distributors would then pass the signal from their head ends to homes - over cables upgraded to two-way digital capability - and handle the day-to-day selling and customer service.if star's cultural and political impact was indirect, li intends his convergence project to have a much more immediate effect - or so his colleagues say. \"he has all the money he needs for his life. the next dollar can't mean very much,\" bonner says. \"the law of diminishing returns applies. i honestly think he lives for making a difference, for positively affecting the lives of as many people as possible.\"yet when i relate this comment to li, he withdraws like a turtle into his shell, giving the kind of resolutely bland and apolitical nod in beijing's direction for which hong kong tycoons are renowned.\"i believe the convergence phenomenon, and the resulting interactivity, will ensure that the vast majority of people - not just a relatively small segment with access to personal computers - will benefit,\" he says.indeed, li takes pains to avow that his convergence project will avoid provoking the region's governments. he intends to tailor the service's original content to prevent confrontations, he says. li defines its editorial policy as \"no religion. period. nothing that instills hate ideas. that talks about intolerance. nothing pornographic.\" and politics? \"no, nothing except what's already happened. reporting.\"li's policy may sound like corporate censorship, but with one important qualification: with his new interactive service, he won't be able to control what individual customers download to their screens. which leads to the real reason his service won't be impeded by asian government suppression: information technologies are already thoroughly penetrating asia.the occasional outburst against foreign media notwithstanding, asian governments are rapidly adopting a more practical attitude toward the flood of new communications technologies. in singapore, for instance, top government officials routinely excoriate foreign media for their politically subversive and morally corrupting influence, especially over their peddling of pornography, dissolute entertainments, and other programs that erode the disciplined, family-oriented \"asian values\" supposedly shared by that region's numerous nationalities and religious groups. but singapore's own economic success is largely based on its state-of-the-art information infrastructure. although the government officially limits entry to the world wide web, the means of control is relatively weak: savvy surfers can quickly learn to reach sites that have been blocked. \"if you try to access the internet, it's no problem,\" says bruce gale, the singapore-based regional manager for the political and economic risk consultancy.china, by far the region's largest potential market for li's services, presents a similar though more subtle and complicated case. in the past year, a schizophrenic internet fervor has gripped the nation. in the business sector, everyone from china's biggest manufacturers to thousands of web-savvy entrepreneurs have thrown themselves headlong into developing online capabilities. the government, meanwhile, can't seem to decide whether the internet is the answer to its long-held dream of a cheap, quick way to vault china to the front rank among nations economically, or the worst-ever threat to its half-century hold on political power.on the one hand, beijing has dubbed 1999 the official \"government online year\" and has clearly stated that development of the internet is a central part of its plans to make china the world's next economic superpower. the potential of the world wide web to cheaply advertise and market exports is seen in particular as an ideal way for cash-poor chinese companies to compete effectively with rich western corporations boasting huge marketing budgets. jiang zemin, the country's president, has declared himself an avid web surfer, and a new government agency - the ministry of information industry - was formed in march 1998 in part to build a modern information infrastructure based largely on internet platforms and technologies.on the other hand, a swift and brutal crackdown in recent months on state-defined cybercrimes shows that beijing still fears the political consequences of the free flow of information. last christmas, two men in jiangsu province were sentenced to death for allegedly hacking into the chinese industrial and commercial bank and electronically absconding with $31,000. in january lin hai, a software salesman in shanghai, was sentenced after a closed trial to two years in prison for supplying 30,000 chinese email addresses to vip reference, a pro-democracy online magazine published in the united states. and the same month, authorities ordered task forces to track down and punish anyone who was posting politically subversive material on the web, according to the hong kong information centre of human rights and democratic movement in china.the myth was set: richard li had faced down the man who ran his own father's company, and won.in addition, as china builds its internet infrastructure, the government is maintaining strict control over local isps with a \"great firewall,\" using proxy servers and filtering technology to ban access to sites containing political subversion, pornography, and other dangerous foreign influences.yet longtime china watchers say that in the larger picture, the present crackdown will likely have little dampening effect on the explosive growth of the net in china. the overall trend in china over the past decade, they point out, has been toward increasing openness, with government attempts to control the foreign electronic media usually sporadic and short-lived.li's technological hurdles remain high, of course. i point out to him that john malone, whose tci cable behemoth is now wiring a portion of the united states for digital television, once said that the software and hardware required to manage the information traffic for interactive services covering only five or six southeastern states would be larger than that required for the entire us space-shuttle operation. how, i ask, will li escape going broke while wiring all of asia?he knits his brow, takes a deep breath, and gives an answer in his best to-the-moon-by-the-end-of-the-decade tone. \"let's just say,\" he responds, \"that if we haven't solved it, we will solve it.\"our last conversation is at the royal hong kong yacht club, where li and i have lunch overlooking a marina stocked with gleaming white sailboats, their tall aluminum masts pinging like wind chimes in the gentle breeze.we're engaged in our usual battle. i am trying to elicit li's admission that the information revolution he hopes to lead in asia will inevitably weaken both the repressive political regimes of the region and the rigidly hereditary and hierarchical power structure of his own family.li is dodging and weaving as only a hong kong tycoon can, shifting every question about political power into the anodyne vocabularies of the free market, increased productivity, and economic progress.\"knowledge is power,\" i prod. \"how do you predict that asians will use the knowledge - thus the power - that you intend to deliver?\"sidestepping my invitation to consider the political empowerment of his subscribers, li mentions the business and educational benefits his service will provide. noticing my skeptical smile, li draws up defensively, showing the vulnerability of a billionaire businessman who knows that any claim to idealism will be quickly dismissed.\"you may say it is abstract,\" he blurts, \"but actually i believe that when you have better dissemination of information, people understand each other more. you have less misunderstanding about what the other guy's motives are.\" when star showed travel programs broadcast from china into taiwan, li says, ordinary taiwanese for the first time saw that their own government's propaganda - that china was still mired in the cultural revolution - was wrong. \"when you have a clearer picture there will be less conflict, less chance of war, more investment, more feeling that china and taiwan are one nation, the same people. and more affinity toward the truth.\"i want him to go further - to link the implications of his communications revolution to his family's role in the asian establishment. \"do you,\" i ask, \"see yourself as your father's son, carrying on in his tradition and motivated by similar basic values?\"even now, li can't bring himself to directly mention \"f.\" staring out over the long rows of docked yachts for several long moments, he finally speaks. \"revolution with sensible evolution,\" he explains to me, \"all toward the same goal, which is meeting a challenge. if there is any tradition, that would be it. meeting a challenge and overcoming it. making breakthroughs.\""}
