to the course of interest rates. share prices stick to a narrow range, while 3com has a very bad day. by david lazarus.", "author": "david lazarus", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "03.03.1999 02:00 PM", "text": "wall street was little changed wednesday as investors opted to play it safe while watching for the latest signs of america's economic vitality, which, the thinking goes, should mean a hike in interest rates to keep inflation at bay. stocks spent the entire session flitting in and out of positive territory. traders kept an eye on fed boss alan greenspan, who repeated to congress his reservations about investing social security funds but offered no hints as to interest rates. with that hurdle passed, investors are now looking ahead to the release of february employment data on friday.the dow jones industrial average fell 21.73 points to close at 9275.88, and the wired index was 9.74 lower at 572.75. the nasdaq composite index gained 6.19 to 2265.22, and the s&p 500 was up 2.20 at 1227.70.while greenspan had nothing new to say about fixing the social security system, he did have this pearl of wisdom for older investors: \"as you move closer and closer to retirement you move to less and less risky assets. if you have everything in equities, if you have everything in internet stocks, you're in real trouble.\"this is why mr. g makes the big bucks.tech shares were buffeted after networking big boy 3com (coms) warned that its fiscal third-quarter earnings will come up short of estimates, probably in the 23-cents-a-share range. analysts had been looking for considerably better performance, more like 36 cents. 3com, which blamed the shortfall on a slump in its sales to business clients, saw its stock tumble 8.8 percent to us$24.63.while the cyclical nature of enterprise-technology sales comes as no surprise, what's most telling here is how badly 3com's shares were punished for the company merely stating the obvious -- that corporate customers are holding back on big-ticket purchases for a variety of reasons, including global economic uncertainty and the y2k reckoning. share prices are still so high, there's simply no margin for error.\"any small disappointment will knock the crap out of a stock,\" said allan roness, research director for jw genesis capital markets. \"we're at a very lofty level now.\"the market's altitude also requires a constant focus on innovation and reinvention to justify sky-high valuations. dell computer (dell) advanced $2.88 to $80.94 as it took the wraps off a new online superstore, gigabuys.com, which will complement its traditional pc lineup with a wide assortment of accessories and software.clearly this is the wave of the future. after achieving critical mass in a particular niche, online retailers are rapidly expanding to cut into the action of other niche players. hence we see amazon.com going from books to cds to movies, and then to an assortment of other goodies. we see yahoo running one of the biggest cyber-malls on the web. and now dell is looking to become the net's one-stop shop for computer gear.\"you make a lot of profit on accessories,\" roness observed. \"the main thing for dell is still their own stuff. now they'll make more profit on all the other stuff they sell.\"for its part, compaq computer (cpq) gained $1.94 to $33.88 after tapping beyond.com (bynd) to provide software support and service via the net. investors weren't so sure if this was in beyond.com's best interest, though, and the company's stock lost $1.31 to $24.81.hewlett-packard (hwp) rose 13 cents to $68.75 on continued enthusiasm for the company's plan to split into two separate publicly traded firms, one focusing on computers and imaging, and the other on measuring devices. morgan stanley dean witter figured it was finally time to take a closer look at hp, initiating coverage with a nice and safe \"neutral\" rating.online hardware retailer cyberian outpost (cool) surged 40 percent to $22.50 after saying it expects fourth-quarter revenue to quadruple to $33 million. of course, cyberian is still losing money and didn't bother saying when break-even is expected. but, hey, what do you want for a net stock?and with enthusiasm for all things dot com showing no sign of waning, it comes as little surprise that online broadcaster netradio has filed to raise nearly $35 million by going public. netradio's majority shareholder, music and software distributor navarre (navr), gained 31 cents to $15.13.look who's coming to dinner: it's painewebber (pwj), announcing the $13.5 million purchase of a 25 percent stake in kingland, which develops online trading services for financial firms. painewebber's better-late-than-never embrace of the net follows a similar move by merrill lynch, which recently shelled out nearly $30 million for the online-trading resources of investment firm d.e. shaw.investors gave a wary reception to painewebber's coming of age, pushing the broker's stock down 63 cents to $36.38. the looming arrival of such a prominent player also produced a mixed reaction among established online brokers. etrade group (egrp) fell 50 cents to $47.19, while ameritrade (amtd) rose 19 cents to $46.81 by saying it will fight back with an expansion of its operations. charles schwab (sch) was 13 cents higher at $73.81.financial-software maker intuit (intu) slipped $2.56 to $88 after saying it will fork over $200 million in cash and stock to acquire payroll-services provider computing resources. separately, intuit said it is suing checkfree (ckfr), a provider of payment services, for alleged contract violations. checkfree's stock dropped 8.7 percent to $35.50.qwest communications international (qwst) declined $1.06 to $59.44 even as it rolled out a new e-commerce package as part of the telco's partnership with microsoft. the service links qwest's high-speed network with redmond's applications to help retailers set up shop on the web. microsoft (msft) was up $1.06 at $149.63.monsanto (mtc), meanwhile, climbed $2.25 to $46.63 following a report in the new york times that the biotech outfit is in merger talks with chemicals giant dupont. both companies declined to comment on the story, which estimated the value of such a tie-up would be at least $28 billion. dupont (dd) was $1.13 lower at $50.19.lastly, a couple of economic indicators. first we have tiffany & co. (tif) advancing $2.13 to $61 after posting a 27 percent increase in quarterly net income to $1.49 a share, topping estimates by a penny. then we have intimate brands (ibi), the leading us lingerie retailer, gaining $2.19 to $43.13 as it reported an 11 percent rise in february sales at outlets open at least a year.say what you will about the precarious economic outlook. someone's having a good time."}
