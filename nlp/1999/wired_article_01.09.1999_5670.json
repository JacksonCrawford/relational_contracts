autumn game into america's most popular spectator sport. and tv's biggest moment in any football season is the super bowl. by steve kettmann.", "author": "steve kettmann", "category": "science",

changed the face of american sports. but all you have to do to appreciate the revolution is plop down and watch an old joe namath talk show being rebroadcast on a classic-sports network.broadway joe was the game's first great tv star, and he was both way ahead of his time and a caricature of the late '60s big-city hepcat. today, steve young does a wink-wink, nudge-nudge commercial with jerry rice. back then, it was namath all by himself, flashing the dimpled grin as he pulled on some nylons.namath's tv presence was nothing to dismiss. take the classic show when he and dick schapp sat still for howard cosell's rat-a-tat-tat rap. the lack of any kind of polish or timing, the long pauses, the \"what now?\" looks that followed yet another cosell insult -- all of it had an immediacy and a power that pulled viewers in and created the illusion that, yes, football players were knowable. the mega ratings of the future were on their way right then, once the fan watching at home felt the game and the people who played it belonged to them, right there in their living rooms.namath's brand of easy-going brashness was perfect for tv. he grew with the medium, signing out of alabama in 1965 for a then-record us$400,000 and sitting on the bench as a rookie that year during nbc's first nationally televised game, called by curt gowdy and paul christman and pitting namath's new york jets against the houston oilers at rice stadium. by january 1969, namath was boldly predicting a jets victory in super bowl iii against the baltimore colts and backing up the boldness. he led his team to victory, earning most valuable player honors, and that super bowl is still considered a classic. namath understood hype, and it is hype that has turned the super bowl into so peculiarly american an institution, a kind of monument of self-celebration.this goes for the athletes and coaches and the days of numbing nothingness that pass for buildup. but it also goes for just about everyone associated with the event, whether it be media or sponsors or the companies flopping all over themselves trying to come up with the most attention-getting commercial.in fact, over the last decade, so many games have been all but decided before halftime, the huge international television audience often finds itself spending less time thinking about off-tackle runs or four-step drops than mocking the cheesy, las vegas-wannabe halftime nonsense, and, of course, parsing and grading and analyzing the commercials. everyone knows everyone's watching, and that gives each weird moment and obvious bomb a sense of heightened interest.this is the aspect of the event, the national-holiday intensity, that has turned the words super bowl into shorthand for the kind of over-the-top excess americans seem to regard with such fondness. new york times columnist frank rich recently grumbled that the various revelations in the clinton sex scandals had all been \"hyped like the super bowl -- only to come and go, leaving the essential civic equation unchanged.\"rich is obviously no fan of the game and all of its big, sloppy glory if he thinks it leaves no lasting impression. that it does, at least at its best moments -- more so than a column by rich or anyone else.all those nfl films clips of great games, narrated by the voice (think: \"the frozen tundra of lambeau field\" whether he actually said it or not), add the aura of myth to the great national holiday, all the more so because the green bay packers were one of the two teams to kick off the whole tradition. led by quarterback bart starr, green bay won that first super bowl, 35-10, and the game was played before a crowd of 61,946 at the memorial coliseum in los angeles.that first super bowl was shown on both cbs and nbc, and the audience was somewhere around 60 million, if that. one-minute tv commercials sold for between $75,000 and $85,000, but the hype machine was running at full tilt: al hirt played his trumpet before the game, joined by bands and baton twirlers and choral groups, and before kickoff, several thousand pigeons were released.the packers were back in the super bowl last year, but the day belonged to john elway and the denver broncos. the game pulled in an international audience of 133.4 million, which ranked just third all-time for the game, tying it with the 1993 game between buffalo and dallas. according to nielsen, the most-watched game in history was super bowl xxx, which attracted 138.5 million viewers. the dallas cowboys' 27-17 victory was far from automatic, but it gave america's team an unprecedented three super bowl victories in four years and a permanent spot in history.unlike in the early days, everything that happens on the field is now covered copiously. by last year's super bowl, the number of cameras surveying the action had risen to 17. every dropped pass is shot from several angles, giving the viewer ample opportunity to process information that in the old days only the sharp eye of an experienced football expert could make out. penalties are usually explained by a replay showing how the offensive lineman lifted his hand a little too high or showing a defensive back bumping a wide receiver after the ball is in the air. facial expressions from the blank mask of disappointment to the ecstatic grimace of triumph are all captured unmistakably and studied.the enveloping presence of television, bucked up by a 1,001 high-tech gadgets, does not just alter the game's profile worldwide, it makes it a different event. contemporary tv brings alive every play, every confrontation, so vividly, that it bombards the senses as dramatically as the latest diversion from nintendo. no wonder the rest of the world tunes in, even if the strategies and rules of the game are mysterious. and no wonder so many people drink so many beers as they watch.steve kettmann has covered professional sports for the san francisco chronicle since 1990."}
