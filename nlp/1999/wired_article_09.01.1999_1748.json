(the actual rate turned out to be close to 13.5.) recently, ibbotson took the same methodology and ran it out to the year 2025. his assumption this time is that the dow jones industrial average should show a 10 percent annual return for the next 26 years. that means the dow will reach 100,000 in early 2024, and pass 120,000 by year-end 2025.to ibbotson's scenario, we've added three more on the graph below. harry dent, author of the roaring 2000s, plots a log curve described by the upper and lower limits of the daily fluctuations of the dow and extrapolates this \"channel\" into the future. he expects the dow to peak at 41,000 in 2008, before taking a dive. charles kadlec, author of the forthcoming book dow 100,000: fact or fiction, bases his forecast on an annual appreciation rate of 11.1 percent. this is the growth rate he observes in periods that enjoy decreasing inflation, decreasing rates of taxation, and lower trade barriers, just as we have now.\"to reach dow 100,000 by the year 2020,\" kadlec says, \"requires a tenfold increase in the dow in a little less than 21 years. we know that is possible because we have just lived through an equivalent tenfold increase in just the last 17 years.\"and those are the conservative estimates. economist kevin hassett and financial columnist james glassman, coauthors of the upcoming book dow 36,000, suggest that we'll reach that mark not in 10 years, but in a few years. they argue that stocks are actually undervalued today and further claim that a century of experience has lowered the risks in stocks to the point where they are as safe as bonds.all four of these forecasts rely on the very plausible premise that the next 20 years will basically extend the current and historical trends of the stock market. they may be wrong, but they are not crazy."}
