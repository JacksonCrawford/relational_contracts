[but] all you have done then is rewarded the microsoft shareholders for the illegal behavior of their management, if they are guilty.\"at its ongoing antitrust trial in washington, microsoft has denied any monopolistic practices -- and has even denied it has monopoly power, insisting it faces severe competition. mcnealy has long disputed this view.he said monday that microsoft was trying to \"leverage\" into areas like consumer appliances, servers, and other sectors.\"if they are allowed to use that leverage before the world moves to this new network economy, they can establish dominant and stifling positions in these new architectures,\" he said, referring to banking, retailing, travel, newspapers, and telephones.gates, for his part, sounded a familiar refrain at the forum. \"i think it would be a tragedy if any government action held companies back in terms of doing more advanced products,\" he said.reuters contributed to this report."}
