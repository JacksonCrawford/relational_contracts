whatshappenin.com? a successful lawsuit would set a precedent that could affect domain-name owners. by chris oakes.", "author": "chris oakes", "category": "security", "type": "article", "timestamp":

trademark.\"the case asks a simple question: does a spanish-language trademark for an internet web site infringe upon its english-language equivalent?\" said whatshappenin.com attorney michael spadaccini in a statement.the case could set a domain-name precedent, since the registration process currently has no safeguards to protect web sites from competitors acquiring foreign language equivalents.if whatshappenin.com is successful, it could pave the way for litigation between other common word sites. perhaps love.com would have a case against amore.com. similarly, news.com might take on noiticias.com, or music.com challenge musique.com.the suit, filed in the us district court, seeks to prevent quepasa.com from using the domain for the words which are the spanish translation of what's happening. the complete charge against quepasa.com: trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising.a quepasa.com spokeswoman said the company could not comment until it had reviewed the suit.whatshappenin.com said the sites are offering similar web services and that the names could be confused by consumers. quepasa.com offers weather, entertainment guides, search services, and horoscopes. whatshappenin.com said this is too similar to its own web service.quepasa.com's service is delivered primarily in spanish, but it also offers an english-language version.\"the law is well-settled and supports our position,\" said spadaccini. \"under the doctrine of 'foreign equivalents,' foreign words from common languages like spanish are translated into english in order to ascertain confusing similarity with english-language trademarks.\"does whatshappening have a case?\"creo que no (i think not),\" said domain-name trademark specialist sally abel of the law firm fenwick & west.\"whatshappenin seems to have taken an advanced course in trademark law and missed the fundamental that descriptive marks are not protectable (if they are) absent significant consumer recognition,\" abel said.descriptive marks describe the product or service in some way, such as its location or in this case, the nature of the service. they are generally ineffective as trademarks, requiring expensive efforts to gain public recongition beyond the literal meaning.that's why abel believes whatshappenin.com may have to show that it has established this \"secondary meaning.\"\"there is something called the doctrine of foreign equivalents but you don't even get to that until you prove that you have a protectable mark. and i don't know that whatshappenin can do that.\"spadaccini countered that the site's visitor traffic totals show that consumers recognize the name.\"we've had 7 million page views since our launch, and we think that's adequate to demonstrate secondary meaning if we need to,\" spadaccini said. the attorney doesn't think the argument will come to that, however.but abel said the other factor on which the case depends -- the similarity between the sites -- may not be as strong as whatshappenin.com believes.\"i don't see them as being sites that are going to confuse consumers as to where they are -- which is the essence of trademark infringement,\" she said.spadaccini countered that sites are close enough. \"both sites answer the question 'what's happening?' they're not exactly the same, but they're using the mark as we use it.\"quepasa.com is a newly public company, while whatshappenin.com is privately held. quepasa.com was among the spate of hot internet initial public offerings in june, shooting from us$7.75 to $19.75 on its opening day.recent history in internet name cases favors quepasa.com, abel added.\"there's been a lot of acknowledgement by the courts that it is possible to have domain names that are only one letter off -- let alone an entire collection of letters off. so i don't see whatshappenin winning this case.\"not only does he expect his client to win, spadaccini expects the case to set a precedent. \"the case is interesting, and will have a wide-ranging precedential effect,\" he said.abel agreed that a victory by whatshappenin.com or a plaintiff with a similar suit would be groundbreaking. such a victory would put a strong hit one of the fundamentals of trademark law.\"are we creating a new type of intellectual property that essentially runs counter to the basics of trademark law?\" abel asked. \"that is, that descriptive marks are not protectable absent secondary meaning, and generic marks are never protectable?\"but cases like whatshappenin.com threaten to alter the descriptiveness rule, abel said. if a court were to decide, for example, that drugstore.com was infringed by drugstores.com, a first-come, first-serve standard could supplant the fundamental descriptiveness rule that would make drugstore.com an indefensible trademark.if whatshappenin finds a judge sympathetic to the first-registered viewpoint, abel could see the company winning. barring such an unusual verdict, abel said she \"would expect the court would find reason to hold that there is no infringement here.\""}
