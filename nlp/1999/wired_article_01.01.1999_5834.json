although your \"interviewer\" graciously doesn't ask this question, tesla's responses reveal a genius with an ego and a generosity that both helped and hurt him in the public's eye and in business.the interview made me ask, \"what would the world do if only we could bring tesla back to life!\"__ janice marconipresident, marconi works internationalmarconi@pcnet.com ____ wanted: dead or alive __according to your interview nikola tesla is living at the ripe old age of 142. according to others, he died in 1943 at the age of 86. which is correct? and could i get a little proof whichever way the answer turns out?__ noel hammillnoel@witty.com ____ bye-bye this domain __maybe the people covered in andrew raskin's article \"buy this domain\" (wired 6.09, page 106) should take a look at jonathan zittrain's article \"keyword: obsolete\" (page 93) before they give all that money to tuvalu.__ hal dunnhal@intersonic.com ____ photo graphic __thank you for courageously publishing the picture of the stillborn child and the accompanying text in your october issue (\"why?\" wired 6.10, page 144). as the father of a stillborn child, i support bringing light to an issue that most people in today's society do not know how to (or choose not to) deal with. while millions of people fight viciously over the ethics of aborting an unwanted child, hundreds of parents grieve over losing an unborn child that they already loved and wanted desperately. many grieve alone, and many grieve without understanding why their child died.__ bob gerardstonetbl@mc.net ____ healthscape __jim clark's vision for healtheon (\"doctor stock,\" wired 6.10, page 122) demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of our health care industry, physician finances, and simple weather.first, less than 3 percent of physicians use paperless medical records, due to the cost of software, length of time required to transmit images via standard telephone lines, and absolutely wretched reliability of computer hardware compared to printed files. while these concerns are minimized within large medical groups in urban settings, those of us in the rural southeast us must accept the realities of low operating margins, limited phone service, and monster lightning storms.second, insurance companies and hmos shy away from systems that ease data sharing, because their profits depend on asymmetric information. third, insurance companies and hmos have all the money and want to keep it that way.good luck, jim. now you know why your experience with healtheon feels like trying to sell another web browser to microsoft.__ donald j. miratemirateye@surfsouth.com ____ reinventing red tape __healtheon created a trial interactive internet site for blue cross and blue shield of massachusetts employees to choose their benefits at the end of 1996, and i was part of the test group that used the system.i had the suspicion all along that healtheon wanted a relationship with bcbsma to legitimize its efforts to enter the health care market. the problem with all these systems is that health care coverage is extremely customized, and each employer has unique benefits. a massive data-processing and human-labor effort would be necessary to manage the variations of coverage. reproducing that system for the internet would require another massive investment. the real question is whether technologically sophisticated companies need a middleman or whether they can themselves use the internet the same way they capitalized on voice-response, pos terminals, and computer claims submissions.__ jeffrey travis atwoodjeffrey_t_atwood@hotmail.com ____ old media meets new __when michael wolff, in his new york magazine column, kept referring to the reporter from brill's content who was writing about him as \"young,\" i attributed it to bad editing. but in \"burn rant\" (wired 6.10, page 82) he does it again: \"my favorite response, however, came from a reporter at brill's content. noah robischon, an earnest young man, seems to think i made up burn rate.\" youth is not necessarily a characteristic that defines or limits anyone. as someone with experience in the internet industry, wolff should know better. insistently holding robischon's youth against him makes wolff seem, well, old.__ erik torkellsnew york ____ changing the rules __i am an avid reader of wired i get it mostly off the shelf here in pakistan. at one time my country aspired to become an industrialized nation, and we still hold that dream. at least our government does. but while we were dreaming of becoming an industrial nation, the nations of the world started turning into information economies.what puzzles me most is that the internet (and the communications revolution) has stretched us into two very different and perhaps opposite worlds. we never had the opportunity to apply the rules of the classic economy, and now the rules have again changed to give way to the new economy.in this age of information economy, where do we stand? who will speak for us?__ nasir farhat khannasir@instecdigital.com ____ captured youth __i loved \"when we were young\" (wired 6.09, page 128). author david s. bennahum managed to capture in words the entire experience of being captivated by the machines as a boy.he perfectly conveys the romanticism, the intrigue, the pure joy of learning, and, above all, the understanding. he also touched on why i feel a strong sense of melancholy when i sit down in front of my screaming pentium 266 with 64 mbytes running nt 4.0 to write a program. i shall give this article to my mom and my wife so they will be able to better understand me as a man by coming to appreciate that part of my boyhood.__ jeffrey lanterjlanter@netcom.com ____ hacker see, hacker do __i subscribe to wired through my office, and i find it one of the most informative magazines about the world we live in and the future we're creating for ourselves. but i felt \"happy hacking\" (wired 6.09, page 143) displayed questionable judgment in today's world. your story begins:\"hacking a toy can be as fulfilling as infiltrating a large corporate computer system, as i've learned during my various adventures with tamagotchi, playskool ... and other various playthings.\"this may sound churlish, but i find myself imagining grateful weirdos out there thinking: \"gee, this is a great idea for building a bomb i can leave on a school bus, too! just like kingpin, this'll make me 'look like one bad muthafucka.'\"__ cliff weisscweiss@naea.org ____ don't stop the presses __what incredible irony that i came across scott messinger's rant about electronic books (\"paperbacks and 8-tracks,\" wired 6.10, page 31) while on final approach to eugene municipal airport.during the exact time that an electronic book is perhaps most useless, i was being told that i was not attached to paper. yet the fact that his rant was on paper allowed me to read it.paper will always have a place, even when electronic resolution equals that of modern printing, and implying that those who prefer it are luddites is wasting both electronic and paper bandwidth.__ john stanleystanley@peak.org ____ behind the fa\u00e7ade __i still can't believe you devoted eight solid pages of your magazine to a photo essay on fry's (\"the future of retail,\" wired 6.09, page 146). granted, the san jose store has a great fa\u00e7ade, but that's about it.if fry's is indeed \"the future of retail,\" heaven help us all.__ steven meloanmeloan@aimnet.com ____ phony phones __apparently bary bertiger came up with the idea for iridium (\"the united nations of iridium,\" wired 6.10, page 134) when his wife could not use her cellular phone while they were vacationing in a resort in the bahamas. but who is going to pay $3 a minute to make a phone call? rich wives who are too spoiled to walk to the resort front desk and use the phone there, that's who.when you have to use sex and snob appeal to sell a phone, something's wrong. this is going to be a huge flop and an expensive lesson.__ bryan chowbryan@translogic.com ____ undo __change of address: imacon (\"worksaver,\" wired 6.10, page 56) can be found on the web at www.imacon-usa.com/. ... alternative press: tibor: tibor kalman, perverse optimist (\"the unabridged tibor,\" wired 6.10, page 43) is published by princeton architectural press. ... wave the ride: the announced merger of tellabs and ciena (\"ride the wave,\" wired 6.10, page 191) was called off.__ send your rants & raves to: __email: rants@wiredmag.comsnail mail: wired, po box 191826 san francisco, ca 94109-9866editorial guidelines: guidelines@wiredmag.comeditorial correspondence: editor@wiredmag.com"}
