way - - - - - -rica guarnieri, x games project manager for the white house office of national drug control policy, raises the specter of those heavy-handed, scare-the-kids ads with no prompting whatsoever.\"we want to go beyond 'just say no,'\" guarnieri said thursday, as she handed out shiny silver stickers reading \"get vertical. not high.\" to as many nine-to-13-year-olds as she could reach. the stickers promote the freevibe web site and its hip take on drug information.before long, 10-year-old mariya approached the booth, just a few spots down from where the us marine information booth was drawing a line for its pull-up bar.it didn't seem like mariya, from san francisco, was paying much attention to what guarnieri had to say. but she loved the sticker \u00ad- and immediately stuck it to her shorts.\"i like that it's shiny and i like this part,\" she said, pointing to where it says \"freevibe.\"\"i think people will pay attention to this,\" added mariya's friend, 12-year-old anna. \"usually in middle school, no one wants to listen to this kind of stuff. lots of kids at my school, a.p. gianinni, smoke and use drugs and stuff. but i'm not friends with those people.\"that's the sort of real-life experience the new antidrug initiative endeavors to take into account.\"extreme games are proof that sports and drugs don't mix,\" said robert houseman, deputy director for strategic planning for the white house drug office.but guarnieri was candid about the fact that few young people wanted to take a break from the fun to think about a serious subject.\"the kids are mixed, to be honest,\" she said. \"you're going to have kids who are too cool for school. but earlier today i had a girl come by who was about 15. she said a couple of her friends were in trouble with drugs and she wanted information to try to help them.\"there's always the titter factor associated with handing out drug information, and the freevibe web site confronts it directly. its top 10 myth list includes items that are sure to make teens laugh: \"experts are not yet sure if marijuana is addictive, but they are sure that some marijuana users develop something called 'amotivation syndrome.' people who develop this disorder become extremely lazy, unmotivated, and they lose interest in things they used to enjoy.\"keeping it real, as a billion pop stars would put it, is a big part of the point.\"when kids see their friends smoking pot, they see that they're not keeling over dead,\" guarnieri said. \"we want to say, 'hey, there's more to it than that.' we want to provide them with information so they can make their own decisions. we want them to just say no so their grades won't go down and they won't lose focus.\"if they know you're being honest with them, they're going to trust you. we want to provide them with the truth about how drugs can screw up your life.\"that effort starts with familiar faces doing the telling. take tony hawk, who made headlines earlier this week with his x games record-breaking 900. people at espn like to call him \"the michael jordan of extreme.\"hawk and his doubles partner, andy macdonald, are both actively involved in getting out the antidrug message. passersby got a glimpse of what hawk had to say on the booth's 21-inch screen: \"when i was young, and had just turned pro, i saw some guys start using drugs recreationally. before long, they lost their focus and dropped out of competing altogether. it was sad to see.\"nearby, macdonald's television commercial was loaded with the requisite funky, ant's-eye-level camera angles, and twilight zone-style lighting, the spot shows macdonald looking cool on his skateboard.\"there's a whole generation of skateboarders out there who are just as talented athletically as some basketball or football player,\" macdonald says. \"someone who isn't afraid to fall down, because you're definitely going to fall down. you're not going to be a failure unless you refuse to get up. drugs hinder that. this [skateboarding] is my idea of getting high.\"the antidrug campaign's presence at the x games was an outgrowth of the television commercials. the white house drug office buys time on espn for spots like macdonald's \"this is my idea of getting high\" bit. espn offered a sponsorship deal as part of its one-for-one pro bono contribution to the effort.\"espn gave us the demographics of the crowd here, parents and teens, and we said it was too good an opportunity to pass up,\" guarnieri said. \"our core group, our bullseye, is kids nine to 13. that's the first time they start to get exposed to drugs and alcohol.\" 2.jun.98"}
