england are questioning the aggressive tactics used by a software publisher's industry association to fight piracy. the business software alliance has long touted its bold actions against companies and individuals who use software without paying for it. software piracy, or \"thievery,\" as the bsa encourages the media to call it, allegedly cost software companies us$11 billion in 1998.but a report on the london-based news site the register monday says that the bsa has gone too far. the birmingham chamber of commerce and industry, along with the advertising standards authority, have condemned the practices of the industry's watchdog group.the two groups were objecting to a campaign sponsored by bsa europe. called crackdown 99, the campaign targeted small and medium-sized businesses and organizations, asking them to audit their computer systems to check for illegal software.if businesses didn't respond to the letters, the bsa sent follow-up notices, threatening to place them on its public database of companies suspected of using pirated software.by stating, \"this is a formal notification that we have not yet received your reply,\" the letters misleadingly implied that the correspondence was official and that recipients were legally obliged to answer the questions posed by the bsa, the two groups told the register.mike newton, campaign affairs manager for crackdown, said that after the complaints by asa and the birmingham chamber of commerce and industry, the tone of the letters was changed to say it was a \"final,\" rather than official, notice.but newton doesn't apologize for the bsa's tactics. \"we've tried friendly exchanges in the past couple of years and we got two to three percent response rates,\" newton said. \"we make no apologies for being more up-front this time around.\" the newer, terser campaign has gotten a 40 percent response rate, newton said.\"we're not a bunch of softies who will just roll over,\" he said.the bsa was founded in 1988 by microsoft. other members include adobe, autodesk, corel corporation, lotus development, novell, and symantec.the bsa started the software watch database in december 1998. on 17 december, bsa europe announced that 15,000 company names had been placed on the database, companies that had not responded to an earlier crackdown campaign.\"that's always been their style,\" said don gotterbarn, head of the software engineering ethics research institute at east tennessee state university. \"instead of being out to rectify the situation, they are out to capture and punish.\"gotterbarn points to a recent ad campaign the bsa sponsored, which showed the image of a water cooler and a caption reading, \"don't gripe here, report software piracy.\"\"they encourage people to contact bsa if their bosses or someone are using bootleg software,\" gotterbarn said. \"the first step in the procedure [should be] to talk with their bosses. the first step should be inside, to deal with it directly.\"karine elsen, director of marketing for the bsa, said the water-cooler campaign is only a way to promote the use of the bsa's hotline, but agreed that the crackdown campaign in europe has generated negative publicity.\"this is not the first time that somebody hasn't liked this campaign,\" elsen said. \"but it's a very effective campaign. sometimes it takes a bit of an aggressive approach to get people's attention.\"the bsa has resorted to all sorts of tactics to get out word that software piracy won't be taken lightly. in 1996, bsa europe offered cash rewards to anyone who turned in a software pirate. \"why should an organization steal -- and benefit from -- a program someone like you may have spent many months developing?\" asked an advertisement on the group's site.so-called \"rat on your boss\" schemes have been enacted by the bsa in australia, hong kong, taiwan, and south africa, as well.more recently, the bsa assembled a group of 40 investigators in tel aviv. divided into teams of four, the investigators paid unannounced visits to small companies, asking for information about their networks. according to the financial times of london, the teams were briefed on \"raid\" procedures by the bsa's israeli representative, ami fleischer.the group has extracted more than $40 million from software pirates in the last six years, according to a 3 june press release. much of its efforts are focused in third world countries and in the far east. on 20 may, the new straits times press reported that 300 companies in malaysia suspected of using illegal software had been given a two-week deadline to replace their programs with legal ones.a january 1998 mother jones investigation accused the bsa of strong-arming companies in developing nations into agreeing to purchase microsoft licensing agreements. calling it a \"global bounty hunter for the software industry,\" the story said that the bsa agreed to drop copyright infringement lawsuits against companies caught with illegal software if the companies agreed to buy legal versions of microsoft's products.the bsa frequently works with government agencies both to enact copyright protection laws and to enforce them.a 1995 editorial in the south china morning post protested the massive crackdown in that country.\"we think the big guns are pointing in the wrong direction,\" the editorial said. \"what the government ought to be cracking down on is giant american software companies that release products riddled with faults and which are seemingly unable to be contacted by the public.\""}
