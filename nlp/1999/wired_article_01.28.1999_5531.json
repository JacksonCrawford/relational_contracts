ever become a net entrepreneur. boob bowl i is her latest marketing move. by polly sprenger.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "01.28.1999 12:40 PM", "text": "of all the web sites vying for super bowl eyes, danni ashe may have hit on the one thing that could tear football fans away from their tv sets sunday. ashe is producing a live internet video show -- boob bowl i -- to air at the same time as the nfl's super bowl half-time show in a move that has boosted subscription rates to her danni's hard drive adult-entertainment site by 50 percent.ashe has become one of the internet stars of the late '90s, making a fortune with one bright idea. in 1995, after nearly 10 years as an exotic dancer and adult-film star, she built a web site featuring herself and other nude models.the press has been mad for her g-string-to-gold-mine life story, describing in one interview after another how she got her start at age 17, dancing on a fake id. reporters tend to characterize her as a sweet little thing who built herself a web site.but ashe's business acumen stands out in the millions of adult web pages. the super bowl stunt is only the latest event that has helped her net more than 3 million users a day and add an average of 6,000 new paid subscribers each month.\"we'll have a number of danni's hard drive models doing their version of what goes on in the locker room,\" ashe said wednesday in a cell-phone interview from the rehearsal site.although ashe dubs the event as \"cleavage convergence,\" her plans for merging tv and the web are serious. and any web companies that might have been scoffing would do well to listen up.\"right now, subscriptions are 90 percent of our revenue, and 80 percent of our subscription site is static pictures alone,\" ashe said. \"i don't envision that lasting much longer. everything is moving toward video, and we're doing as much as we can in that area.\"ashe is building her own broadcast facility and brainstorming with her staff of 17 on how the company can build content that is uniquely designed for web-and-tv convergence.\"we're hoping to take it to the next level and do unique programming,\" she said. \"we see ourselves as becoming our own channel, when broadband gets to everyone.\" unlike her contemporary, internet entertainment group ceo seth warshavsky, ashe doesn't spend a lot of time trying to shock the world into viewing internet events.\"seth and i both use some of the same marketing techniques,\" ashe said. \"we tend to use pr rather than advertising to market ourselves. but we do it in different flavors. to me it's very important to try to be more supportive of the women in the industry. i think seth is less concerned with the people and more concerned with profit.\"in fact, ashe deplores warshavsky's instinct for the grotesque, such as his latest effort -- an online sex-change operation.\"it's disgusting,\" ashe said. \"he's playing on all of the dark sides of humanity, all of those dirty little things that nobody wants to talk about.\"compared to some of warshavsky's stunts, ashe's site is cotton-candy porn. a requisite number of big-breasted models are accompanied by folksy captions like: \"i thought i'd bring you an e-zine that shows off the slender, more petite side of nature.\"the site is the foundation of the business, but ashe has plans to move out of a strictly subscription-based revenue scheme. one plan for building other revenue streams is to resell the custom software applications she and her staff have spent years developing.\"we've started to think about offering a service for other webmasters. all of last year we spent building up our infrastructure,\" she said. soon, other sites will be able to pay a fee to use her credit-card billing application, email-response software, and other business services that an upstart pornography site needs.although she's held up as a model e-commerce entrepreneur, ashe said she doesn't have as many partnerships within the technology industry as she'd like. in an industry where every company is in bed with the other, ashe said her porn stigma keeps them away.\"everyone is interested and wants a piece of our audience and our traffic. but there's a lot of fear of jumping in with an adult company.\" so while her pageviews are the envy of the industry, ashe says she doesn't expect to see herself on stage at the next technology conference. besides, the woman whose naked body appears everywhere on the web is nervous about public speaking.\"i would rather striptease for the supreme court than give a speech,\" ashe said. \"i have a morbid fear of public speaking.\"ashe said she was approached by cnet and nbc to work on their joint-effort portal snap, but the companies shied away at the last minute, worried about the ramifications of working with an adult company.\"we are at a very strange place in this society. we have very strong puritanical undercurrents, but we have a lot of freedoms,\" ashe said. \"it's forbidden and dirty, but it's still available.\"her female contemporaries hold her up as an icon. mimi miyagi, another dancer turned webmistress, used the revenue from her web site to give up the live dancing business and start a family.\"she was definitely a mentor,\" miyagi said. \"when problems would arise or i needed business advice, she was there. she's a very honest person and still down to earth.\""}
