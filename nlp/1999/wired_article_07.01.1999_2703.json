(onboard navigation unit: $1,800.) __tele aid (mercedes-benz) a three-button premium package that includes onboard navigation. drivers can contact emergency help and roadside assistance from protection one via the overhead console, or obtain general information about the car and limited routing assistance from a mercedes call center. the next step for mercedes will be concierge services - such as restaurant locations and hotel reservations - similar to those of onstar and bmw's mayday phone.__ price: standard on all year 2000 s-class models. __autopc (clarion and microsoft) microsoft's windows ce-powered play to capture the road's wireless future. once the platform is fully in place by this fall, one-touch road assistance can be coupled with a voice-activated computer that recognizes commands for traffic reports, numeric paging, and email. other options include a navigation unit providing spoken turn-by-turn directions and a diagnostic module configured to check the car's main computer for malfunctions.__ price: the $1,299 sticker price basically buys you a car stereo with upward mobility; expect to tack on around $850 just to get your system up to speed, plus monthly fees ranging from $5 for traffic updates to $16 for \"voice email.\" __"}
