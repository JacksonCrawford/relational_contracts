guys in black hats. but computer security experts warn that online criminal activity is increasing, and the perpetrators are growing more sophisticated.", "author": "reuters", "category": "science", "type": "article", "timestamp": "04.19.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "a computer virus writer with the stolen america online user name \"sky roket\" turns up on a computer bulletin board in norway and is arrested in new jersey. a north carolina computer engineer using an anonymous web site service is linked to a stock hoax in california. cybersleuths are catching perpetrators of hoaxes and malicious acts on the internet more quickly, helped by growing cooperation between the online industry and law enforcement agents.\"we're getting past the age of denial,\" said richard powers of computer security institute in san francisco. \"people are realizing there's a problem and that we have to work on it together.\"but even after a string of high-profile takedowns of alleged web criminals, the security experts championed as the sam spades of the digital age are warning about the future.computer crime is growing, and smart criminals are avoiding prosecution, they say. computer security institute surveys show that over the past year, \"online intrusions\" doubled as a percentage of computer crime.the reason it's happening, say the computer experts, is \"that's where the money is.\"\"now that e-commerce is coming online and getting bigger and bigger, the fraud and criminal activity that used to be committed with fax and phone is moving onto the internet,\" said george vinson, a former fbi cybercrime unit member who is now with deloitte & touche's computer security practice.the experts say their search for perpetrators has gotten a boost from some less-than-clever methods used by crackers and hoaxters.for example, david smith, the 30-year-old new jersey man charged with creating melissa \"actually signed his name to some of the online documents he created,\" noted richard smith, the cambridge, massachusetts-based cybersleuth who was credited with the key breaks in cracking the melissa case.the melissa virus disrupted and crashed some e-mail and computer networks at thousands of companies and government agencies by overloading their systems. smith, who was charged last week with violating an array of new jersey computer laws, faces up to us$480,000 in fines if convicted.cyberleuth smith, who works for software company phar lap, found clues when he tracked the online postings linked to the suspect.\"david smith was a very good macro virus writer, but not a terribly good hacker,\" said security expert michael zboray of gartner group. \"he could have done a much better job of covering his path. the next time this happens it might not be so easy.\"perpetrators of cybercrimes have felt safe in the anonymity of cyberspace. but internet service providers are growing more eager to hand over user logs in criminal investigations. and investigators are becoming better at searching the scenes of virtual crimes for clues to a perpetrator's identity.\"criminals over the years have always left a signature or a fingerprint or a footprint to let investigators find them,\" said vinson. \"some hackers think they are a lot smarter than they are, and they don't give law enforcement much credit for having the technical capability to find them.\"\"hackers are dumb,\" argues garnter's zboray. but he warned of a growing threat from increasingly sophisticated white collar criminals who can operate with more stealth than hackers \"who really just want fame and notoriety.\"he says sophisticated attackers can secretly gain unauthorized access to computer installations, then wipe out the hard disk drives from which they launched their offensives. that would make them virtually impossible to track.richard pethia, director of the computer emergency response team at carnegie mellon university, told a house science subcommittee hearing this week that future viruses \"could easily be much harder to detect, spread even more quickly, and cause significantly more damage\" than melissa.nonetheless, vinson said law enforcement professionals have made great strides. vinson worked to set up the fbi west coast cybercrime unit that tracked the notorious hacker kevin mitnick. he said public awareness has grown since that time, along with the will to crack down on abuses.\"back then when we went to an isp (internet service provider), with a warrant, we'd have to go through a whole long delay with a series of lawyers,\" said vinson. \"i think we've gotten beyond that in cases where there is criminal activity.\"in the pairgain stock hoax case, fbi special agents backtracked from a bogus web page set up to show pairgain technologies being taken over by another company. a copied bloomberg news service page looked real enough, but was actually a fake graphical representation posted to the angelfire anonymous web page service.the fbi agents dug into internet protocol addresses -- numbers linked to specific sites on the internet but not specific computers. using those so-called ip addresses they found the internet account that allegedly was used by a 25-year-old computer engineer from pairgain. they arrested the man, gary dale hoke, and charged him with defrauding investors who lost money because of the hoax.but once again, as with the melissa case, the alleged hoax involved simple off-the-shelf technologies that proved easy to unravel. the digital detectives may not have broken any new ground in using better anti-hacking technology, but they have managed to raise awarness of problems.\"the good thing about the sherlock holmeses of the internet is that they are showing us that the locks are not so good,\" says gartner's zboray. \"and if sherlock says so, then you better go out and get new locks.\"copyright"}
