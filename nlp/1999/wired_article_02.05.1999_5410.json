by coincidence, cbs also posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $1 million, compared with profit of more than $860 million a year ago. when you look past all the one-time charges and what not, however, the company could claim a profit of 2 cents a share, beating estimates by a penny.lanvision systems (lanv) surged 129 percent to $4 after announcing that the health alliance of greater cincinnati, which runs a bunch of hospitals, has inked a four-year contract to receive specialized health-care info via the web. terms of the deal were not disclosed.qwest communications international (qwst), on the other hand, fell $3.06 to $57.44 even as it landed a $42 million contract to provide high-speed voice and data service for kansas-based st. andrews telecommunications. mci worldcom (wcom), meanwhile, gained 13 cents to $76.25, while at&t (t) was down $2.94 at $88.50.from the ipo front, delphi automotive systems (dph), the parts unit of general motors, rose 8.5 percent to $18.44 on its first day of trading. the world's largest auto-parts maker sold 100 million shares initially priced at $17 apiece, making this one of the biggest ipos ever.fdx (fdx) finally came to terms with its fedex pilots, who approved the company's first-ever labor contract granting them more pay, better flight schedules, and other such goodies. fdx rose 63 cents to $82.56.dole food (dol) inched 6 cents higher to $31.94 after reporting fourth-quarter results that clearly reflected huge crop losses in hurricane-battered central america and uncharacteristically icy california. mother nature handed dole a loss of 13 cents a share, excluding charges, which in any case was a penny better than expected.lastly, pixar animation studios (pixr) declined $2.63 to $40.63 after revealing that its quarterly profit had dropped 75 percent to 2 cents a share, which was still a marked improvement over the 3-cent loss analysts had been watching for.of course, pixar still has a tsunami of money coming its way from \"a bug's life,\" its thanksgiving release, which so far has grossed about $155 million at the box office. things should brighten for the company very soon."}
