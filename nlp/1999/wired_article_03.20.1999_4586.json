(one judge tells us y2k likely will be a finalist.)like any good storyteller, tiggre shows glimpses of social chaos from the perspective of some notable characters: jared the mormon doctor; alexis, a military officer responsible for coordinating y2k contingency planning; merlyn, leader of a survival community called the dollar ranch; and angel, the driven leader of the la gang.tiggre is a libertarian, a freelance political writer, and the founder of the liberty round table. his individualistic ideas inspire the book instead of ruining it. just about anyone should find y2k a stay-up-all-night read.patriots: surviving the coming collapseif you're worried about y2k blackouts and scattered looting, patriots: surviving the coming collapse will do one of two things. the novel will reassure you that power failures aren't really that bad, or it will give you teeth-grinding nightmares for each of the 280-some days left until 1 january 2000.penned by james wesley rawles, patriots describes not isolated glitches but the complete collapse of society. in fact, an earlier version of the novel -- and the one wired news reviewed -- was titled teotwawki, or the end of the world as we know it. neither book is specifically about y2k, but rawles has been active in y2k survivalist circles, and the inchoate crisis at the beginning of the book jibes quite nicely with apocalyptic predictions of computer-induced doom.so when the lights go out and banks fail in the first few pages, it's hardly a big deal. the hardy band of survivalists who have spent years prepping their retreat in the hills of north-central idaho simply switch over to solar power, close their steel-reinforced shutters, and jam fresh magazines into their well-oiled ar-15s. the real drama comes chapters later, when the roving motorcycle gangs attack. and then the army comes.the bad news: patriots suffers from hackneyed writing and nonexistent character development. but don't think of this book as fiction. you'll enjoy it much more as a survivalist manual that just happens to have a plot.glitch: the y2k conspiracydoug woodson, a kind-hearted computer geek with the charisma of a walrus, has accepted a six-figure job fixing code for a shadowy corporation. the fine print of the deal confines him to the corporate grounds, which offer movie theaters and plush casinos but little contact with the outside world. armed guards ensure no programmers have second thoughts.in short, woodson is a prisoner. when he registers the enormity of the company's betrayal, he attempts escape. that's when the intrigue begins.glitch, by david kedson, follows woodson as he begins to unravel a skein of deception that leads to international skullduggery involving the indonesian government. the goal: to exploit y2k's impact on the world by monopolizing all competent programmers.improbable? certainly, and that's one of the book's weaknesses. others include the hamfisted way kedson introduces new ideas through a character who has no purpose other than to serve as a portable oxford english dictionary. but kedson manages to make it all enjoyable anyway, in part because of the book's charming -- if at times unduly naive -- second main character, federal agent jennifer thomas.while woodson is cooling his heels in his high-tech jail, thomas is infiltrating federal agencies to puzzle out how they're doing on y2k repairs. the unsurprising answer: schedules are slipping.what is surprising, however, is the reason. thomas learns that programmers are being lured away to work for -- you guessed it -- the same shadowy indonesian corporation. eventually the two join forces and try to penetrate to the heart of the mystery.y2k: the day the world shut downwe first see bob priam snug in his rural retreat, a cottage surrounded by lilac and lavender bushes, after y2k has arrived and computers have crashed. outside, stealthy intruders with faces obscured by night-vision goggles have circled his home. silently, they creep toward him with all-too-sinister intent.it's not a bad way to begin a novel. too bad the rest of the novel, by michael hyatt and george grant, isn't as compelling.hyatt, a leading figure in the hoard-guns-and-gold movement and a frequent guest on religious radio talk shows, has already written a preparation guide called millennium bug: how to survive the coming chaos. his weekly email updates warn his readers of the worst: social security won't make it! sell your stocks now!he should have stuck to nonfiction. it's not that the writing is terrible or the plot absent. the authors do a competent job of leading us through priam's journey, from being fired for telling his boss about the cost of y2k fixes to launching his own spectacularly successful consulting firm.the real problem is the heavy-handed moralizing: it's the god-directed duty of every christian to evangelize preparedness -- and just plain evangelize -- even at the expense of individual readiness. hyatt's real-life web site argues much the same thing. a good idea? maybe. but it gets in the way of what would otherwise be a good yarn."}
