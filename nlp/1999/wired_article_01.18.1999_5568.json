but mp3 advocates aren't amused. by ronald warren deutsch.", "author": "ronald warren deutsch", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "01.18.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "it sounds like there's something for everybody in encrypted mp3: music lovers get the format they want. artists get the royalties they deserve. but mp3 fans say that's not exactly how it works. there's plenty of buzz surrounding the recording industry association of america's release of the secure digital music initiative (sdmi). while it clarifies the riaa's stance on digital music downloads, the sdmi has caused some confusion about what encryption means, why it is needed, and exactly whom it benefits.m-trax is a new mp3 player set for release on 24 january from mcy.com, and the company took pains to comply with the sdmi.bernhard fritsch, president and ceo of mcy.com, has been working on the technology for three years. he says it not only encrypts and watermarks mp3 files, it offers a \"unique and proprietary digitizing tool to deliver 100 percent cd-quality.\"short for motion picture experts group audio layer 3, mp3 compresses music files at near-cd quality for easy transmission over the internet.fritsch thinks his deals with well-known record labels and \"almost the entire indie scene,\" will be a big part of m-trax's success. he won't disclose which labels, but says their rosters include tina turner, john coltrane, and bob marley.other companies -- namely liquid audio, a2b, and audiosoft -- are also competing to provide the riaa with secure digital download formats. but michael robertson, president of mp3.com, says that race misses the point.\"focusing on security is a bad idea,\" robertson says. with cds, robertson explains, you can play the music in your home, office, or in your car. you can take it to a friend's house or, when you've tired of it, sell it to a used record store. you can't do that with encrypted mp3 files.\"the goal is compatibility,\" says arnold brown, president and ceo of audio explosion, whose mjuice is another player in the encrypted mp3 market.brown believes the riaa is creating a framework but that ultimately it it will not endorse one format over another. audio explosion has taken a step toward compatibility by making its format operable on diamond's rio player.nick digiacomo, vice president of electronic markets at scient and a riaa consultant for sdmi, says compatibility is one aim of the new initiative.\"no matter which format a particular record company decides to go with, you should be able to play it or send it around no matter which player is used,\" digiacomo says. thus, users who purchase a song in liquid audio format should be able to play it on mjuice, a2b, or m-trax.freeamp, an open source mp3 player, is also incorporating direct support for the rio, as is liquid audio.\"the best way to combat the illegal duplication and distribution of music on the internet is to provide consumers with open, flexible solutions that make purchasing, downloading, and playing music extremely easy,\" says gene hoffman, president and ceo of online recording label goodnoise, which helped to develop freeamp.for goodnoise, the operative word is \"open.\" in fact, hoffman and some of his staff previously worked at the software encryption company pgp. as steve grady, vice president of corporate communications, puts it, \"we know encryption and that's not the solution.\"grady says the term \"encrypted mp3\" is an oxymoron. \"once you add encryption, it's no longer an open standard. and that's the whole point of mp3.\"the riaa wants more than to prevent illegal duplication and distribution, according to digiacomo. \"it's about the recording companies and artists being appropriately compensated for it. if the music is free for too long, there won't be any music.\"\"the riaa's vision is somewhat similar to divx,\" a pay-per-view dvd format, he explains. \"what the riaa wants is the freedom to sell a song with certain security or purchasing codes embedded which will dictate how many times you can play or copy the music.\"in other words, users might buy a song for us$5 and be able to copy it three times, or pay $20 for the ability to copy it 10 times. or, they might be charged for the number of times they expect to play the song. the code in the song would let the software player know how many plays or how many copies are left.that is exactly what another encrypted-mp3 company, audiosoft, has accomplished. after three digital copies are made, the copy capacity is disabled.steve grady at goodnoise agrees that it's not about duplication, although he sees it differently from digiacomo. \"the whole piracy issue is a diversion, it's about control.\"grady says people trading music over the internet are not traditional pirates, they're fans. there are already laws in place to stop people making money through illegal duplication and those people are easy to find on the internet and can be shut down.\"[sdmi] is about maintaining the infrastructure of the major record labels,\" says grady. since illegal files on the net originate from cds, he says pirates can only be stopped by removing cds and tapes from store shelves. the mp3 movement is a reaction to the label's control. \"this is about the artists and indie labels looking for alternative distribution channels to get more of a share of the pie.\"digiacomo nevertheless warns \"it's going to be up to the various competing formats to get on the riaa bandwagon.\" there will be those who will resist and those who will come late, he said. \"there'll be a shakedown, and it's not going to be pretty.\"michael robertson at mp3.com disagrees. \"this may be what the riaa wants, but i believe the consumer won't buy it.\""}
