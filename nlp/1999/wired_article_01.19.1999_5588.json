price tag: us$6.7 billion, almost twice excite's stock market value. by craig bicknell.", "author": "craig bicknell", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "01.19.1999 07:30 AM", "text": "at home said tuesday it agreed to buy excite, the third-largest net search engine, for about us$6.7 billion, creating a company with the intellectual firepower to take on microsoft, yahoo, and america online. the move also would significantly stretch at&t's reach across the entire internet. at&t, the largest us phone company, is about to conclude its acquisition of tele-communications inc., which is at home's largest shareholder.\"it's a tremendous deal for at home,\" said louis kerner, an analyst with goldman sachs. \"the internet is about scale and presence and reach, and this dramatically increases at home's scale. this solidifies their dominant position in broadband, which is the future of the internet.\"the value of the offer was staggering, nearly double excite's $3.4 billion market value and much larger than america online's pending $4.2 billion offer for netscape communications.under terms of the agreement, at home (athm) will issue 1.041902 of its series a shares for each share of excite's shares. based on at home's friday closing stock price of $102, it would be paying $106.27 a share for excite (xcit), a 57 percent premium.the price tag reflected at home's financial muscle -- a market capitalization of $12.4 billion -- and its eagerness to use that muscle to purchase brand oomph, audience share, and content-development capabilities. at home had to pay the high premium to stave off rival suitors, which reportedly included yahoo and microsoft.\"this accelerates us three or four years down the road,\" boasted tom jermoluk, at home's chairman and chief executive. \"we would have had to spend tens of millions of dollars to get the national reach that excite already has.\" excite will immediately begin to market at home's service to its 20 million registered users through targeted emails.jermoluk said excite's marketing will boost at home's subscriber growth by 20 percent each year over the next several years. \"that's enough to make this deal a slam dunk.\"manna for ma bellunderpinning the deal is at&t (t). the largest us phone company -- which is nearing completion of a takeover of tci -- has been taking bold steps to keep up with new industries being created by the internet.with at home and excite in its arsenal, at&t would control a large portion of the internet backbone, the last mile of cable into 30 million homes, and the third-largest search engine -- an arsenal that not even microsoft (msft) can match.at&t will pitch regular internet access through phone wires to excite users in parts of the country that at home can't currently serve. at&t will eventually use its marketing might to pitch at home's broadband service to excite's 20 million registered users.\"this is the only company that's positioned for growth in all bands,\" said george bell, excite's chief executive.the new at home could see revenue of about $2 billion by 2002, with a profit margin of about 33 percent, jermoluk said.\"five years from now, the at home network is a high-speed cable version of america online,\" said gerry kaufhold, multimedia and digital tv analyst for cahners in-stat group. \"only, instead of being owned by america online, it's owned by at&t.\"excite's opportunitiesfirst and foremost, excite has found a way to survive and thrive. in recent months, its audience growth has stagnated, and its market value dropped far beyond that of its rivals.the stalled growth was a red flag for potential suitor yahoo, which decided to drop its bid after taking a close look at excite. \"we have a lot of respect for what they\ufffdve done\" for the portal space, said yahoo president jeff mallet, \"but we didn\ufffdt see anything special over there,\" he said. \"their reach has been down for the last three quarters.\"with at home, excite gains entrance into the broadband market, perhaps the biggest opportunity to lure big advertisers onto the net.\"this lets us reach users across all bands and all devices,\" said bell, who will continue to head excite as a subsidiary of at home. that broad reach will be a major draw for advertisers, because excite will be able to make one advertising purchase that crosses all net boundaries.at home is concentrating its resources on developing so-called rich media -- content that takes advantage of broadband's ability to display animation and video. some advertisers have been reluctant to advertise on the internet, because low-speed access through traditional modems won't let advertisers create compelling ads. with at home's network and excite's reach, at&t could attract more advertising revenue.another potential boon for excite: the credit-card billing information from at home, tci, and at&t customers. armed with that information, excite's direct marketing subsidiary, matchlogic, could ramp up its targeted marketing efforts -- big time.\"it's a tremendous platform for doing personalized marketing in a new way,\" said andy halliday, excite's vice president of commerce.because of the acquisition, however, excite might have to untangle itself from aol and netscape. excite has agreements with those companies to supply search services and content. the future of excite's $70 million contract with netscape is now in doubt. netscape can't renege on the deal, but excite can, bell said.\"the option of exit remains a possibility for us,\" he said. excite would get a refund of between $35 million and $40 million, depending on when the contract is terminated.odd man out?with excite now off the table, the remaining web giants and traditional media titans have just one big free-standing portal to chase: lycos. investors bid up lycos shares $15.25, or 17 percent, to $103.13 tuesday morning on speculation that the bidding will be hot. lycos is in the process of buying wired digital, the parent company of wired news.still, the big price tag for excite may discourage potential suitors for lycos. microsoft might be willing to pony up a premium, but some big media firms may not. news corp.'s chairman rupert murdoch said two weeks ago that portals have gotten too rich for his blood.bruce smith, an analyst at jefferies & company thinks big media companies may no longer be in the market to buy. the more likely buyers are tech companies with huge market values. \"who's big enough to buy [lycos]? america online, yahoo, and microsoft.\"louis kerner of goldman sachs says that lycos will almost definitely be acquired. \"it's hard to imagine them continuing on a stand-alone basis.\"lycos left all options open. \"we're always talking to potential partners,\" said spokeswoman madeline mooney. \"we feel that only the strong survive.\"pete danko, jennifer sullivan, and chris oakes contributed to this
