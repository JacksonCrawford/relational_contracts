(he's ceo and editor in chief; she's president and editorial director.) for another, advertisers have become more accepting of sex in mainstream publications - pick up any recent issue of maxim, details, or gear (and then take a cold shower). and salon.com's blanket coverage of sex has given new meaning to the term \"sticky site.\"in response, this fall griscom and field are launching nervecenter, a portal offering personals, free email, homepages, and suggestive greeting cards to all comers. paying subscribers will have access to the especially risqu\u00e9 photo archive and can join high-minded chats on nerve columns like \"this week in sex\" and \"jack's naughty bits.\"nerve's also relaunching its ecommerce site, the nerve boutique, which sells t-shirts, underwear, and pajamas. and griscom is hoping to close a $10 million round of venture financing to fund marketing and international expansion.as griscom and field oversee the repositioning of their site, they're also getting used to sharing an office but not a bed. the breakup, griscom says, \"has made my work slightly more relevant to my life.\"must readhot tongue actionpower exchangenaughty bitsstupid net lawsthe lewis and clark expeditionclark's remarkstired/wiredpeoplejargon watchthe wages of simpac-ratinstant replaypc and a blow-drygimme redmondraw data"}
