no ocean cleanup, cost efficiency, and reusable fuel. the only problem is that it could cost up to $5 billion to build the two sets of reusable boosters that could fly up to 12 missions per year.the house appropriations committee voted friday to restore us$400 million of the $1.325 billion a spending subcommittee cut from the space agency's $12.3 billion budget.the panel restored $75 million for future mars missions, as well as $225 million for focused technology that supports planetary missions, especially to the outer planets. also included was $100 million for the space infrared telescope facility.at friday's space shuttle development conference, boeing project manager tom hamilton touted his company's \"reusable liquid first stage\" booster, which use liquid oxygen and kerosene for fuel instead of monomethyl hydrozine and nitrogen tetroxide.but don sauvageau, manager of systems engineering at thiokol propulsion, which builds nasa's current solid boosters pointed out that the new reusable designs will require engineers rebuild them from scratch.boeing and lockheed cost estimates are conservative, he said, and the reusable booster could cost upwards of $10 billion. thiokol estimates its five-segment rocket booster will cost a little less than $1 billion.thiokol presented its own new concept for a rocket booster, a five-segment solid model that is not a complete throwaway. each segment, weighing about 300,000 pounds each, can be towed back to the base and reused.\"the people at nasa are responsible for looking at both alternatives and comparing them from equal sets of requirements,\" said sauvageau.thiokol also plans to update the parachute design since the shuttle hasn't had an upgrade since the program began. engineers there have redesigned the parachute to use more sophisticated materials that will reduce the weight of the parachute and still take up the same amount of volume on the craft.thiokol presented its new concept of a five-segment solid rocket booster that would add a center segment to the present booster and a newly designed nozzle, increasing the length of the booster 26 inches.\"we're taking advantage of all we've learned from the shuttle missions, and the benefits far outweigh the detriments,\" sauvageau said.one of the biggest problems that keep costs up and efficiency low for the shuttle program are the toxic fuels on which rockets runs. the propellants require workers to wear bulky, uncomfortable protection gear, and the area around the shuttle must be completely cleared in order to work on the fueling system.this keeps labor hours and costs very high. for example, nasa predicted that by now a shuttle flight would require 20 work shifts from launch to landing, but in actuality it takes an average of 120 shifts.but there are options to toxic fuel problem, according to boeing. benjamin barrera, an engineer with boeing who works with electric motors and power electronics, presented research on alternatives to the monomethyl hydrozene and nitrogen tetroxide fuel mixture currently used. the company is working on replacing these with liquid oxygen.it may sound simple to engineers, but it poses problems because liquid oxygen evaporates easily and requires specially designed tanks, barrera said. it also needs to be ignited, whereas the hazardous fuels combust when they contact each other.another option to get rid of the fuel altogether is to go with an electric motor, according to barrera. boeing is taking its cue from electric carmakers to come up with lithium ion cells that could run a shuttle.because of all the research being done by companies like nissan, general motors, ford, and the department of energy in the past three to four years, progress has accelerated rapidly.another key to saving time and money for the shuttle is the development of integrated vehicle health management, or ivhm. basically, nasa is designing the shuttle to take care of itself.ultimately, that would mean it could diagnose how its subsystems are running, much like cars do today.\"we want to plug an instrument in and say 'are you ready?' and [the shuttle] will say 'yes,' or 'heck no, i have a flat left tire, fix it!'\" said w.t. powers of the nasa marshall space flight center.nanotechnology, a science that builds subatomic components, will play a key role in developing diagnostic sensory systems for ivhm, said meyya meyyappan, project manager for devices and nanotechnology at the nasa ames research center.sensors made of carbon nanotubes could prove to be small enough and sensitive enough for use on the shuttle, and will take over when silicon improvements max out, meyyappan said.the ames center is currently building a nanotechnology lab.meyyappan also said he expects funding for nanotechnology to escape the effects of the proposed nasa budget cuts.\"like (astronaut) gus grissom said, funding makes the rocket go up!\""}
