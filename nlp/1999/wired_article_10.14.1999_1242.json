but now, on the web, the whole world is watching. by andrew rice.", "author": "andrew rice", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "10.14.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "when a massive avalanche killed two american mountain climbers last week, it was the first time such a tragedy happened to climbers providing regular web updates to the world. in the early days of himalayan climbing, news of such a tragedy would have taken weeks to reach the outside world, but bad news travels fast in the age of digital sportscasts.alex lowe and dave bridges were part of the 1999 american shishapangma ski expedition, which sought to not only climb the 26,291 foot high himalayan peak, but also to ski back down. they and the rest of their team had been sending photos and dispatches to mountainzone.com every day for almost a month.climber conrad anker, most famous for discovering the long-lost body of sir george mallory on mt. everest this spring, was injured in the slide. but he was well enough to assist with the search for his lost companions.lowe, age 40, was widely considered to be the best all-around climber in the world.as part of outdoor-gear manufacturer the north face's professional climbing team, lowe had recently made trips to antarctica and trango tower in pakistan's karakoram range. bridges was a 29-year-old mountain filmmaker from aspen, colorado, who was also an experienced climber and skier. he was one of three camera operators assigned to the climb.\"i got a call early in the morning from andrew maclean, the expedition leader,\" said peter potterfield, the editor and publisher of mountainzone.com, which waited until the families had been notified to report the news. \"they had just finished searching all day for the bodies and had found nothing. to me the news was obscene, but we had to deal with it.\"dispatches from the climbers still on the mountain searching for their friends conveyed the horror and magnitude of watching a gigantic slab of snow and ice break free more than 6,000 vertical feet up the peak. two separate groups ran for cover as the avalanche roared down. lowe, bridges, and anker, however, were caught by the slide.\"the compression of time one experiences when you're a small person underneath this huge avalanche is amazing,\" anker told mountainzone.com. \"we all ran in separate directions. i looked back three times and on my third time i saw david and alex close together. at this point i laid down onto the ice, secured myself with my ice axe and put my arms over my head in a prone position and was instantly hit by massive ice and snow unlike anything i've ever felt.\"after the avalanche passed, anker dug himself out and began looking for his climbing partners. their bodies still have not been recovered.\"two great people are now in a higher place,\" said expedition member kristoffer erickson, \"their souls have entered a greater existence.\"sites that provide daily or even more frequent updates from expeditions in the field have become extremely popular, gathering hit counts in the millions. the tragic 1996 storm on mt. everest that took several climbers' lives and was the subject of jon krakauer's best selling book into thin air fed the public's desire to be armchair travelers.\"we'd been trying to do cybercasts since before 1996,\" said mountain guide wally berg, who has summitted everest four times and leads climbing expeditions all over the globe. \"i had a satellite phone and laptop at everest base camp in 1992, but there was hardly anyone on the internet back then. it was only because of the events of 1996 that suddenly everyone became aware of the possibilities.\"the sudden appearance of cybercasting technology on trips to remote regions raises questions for many wilderness travel buffs. outside magazine editor-in-chief hal espen recently took a four-day mountain biking trip in colorado with a mountainzone.com correspondent who was putting daily dispatches and photos up on the web.\"i have enormous questions about the root appropriateness of that kind of media coming along for the trip. it raises all sorts of questions about why we go into the wilderness. it reminded me a little too much of my day job.\"in the world of professional climbers heading to places like shishapangma, everest, and k2, however, espen said, \"those kinds of concerns are dwarfed by the fact that expeditions and climbers are happy to have sponsorships from any source.\"eric simonson has guided numerous big mountaineering expeditions and recently led the group that found sir george mallory's body high on the flanks of everest. several of his trips have included mountainzone.com coverage.providing ongoing expedition dispatches, said simonson, \"is an enormous amount of work. but i think it's part of the democratization of the sport. now it's possible for people to experience climbing in a lot of different ways. it's turned climbing into a spectator sport.\"some climbers and observers have questioned whether the ever-increasing attention brought to major expeditions raises the stakes of success to a level where people will make bad judgment calls. berg, however, is not so sure.\"will this affect people's judgment?\" he asked, \"perhaps. but it's going to be a double-edged sword. you are going to be more accountable than ever before for the decisions you make. when i make a judgment on the mountain now, i know that my wife can look on the internet and see what i'm doing. mrs. jones' third-grade class can see me on the internet. i'm not sure it's a logical conclusion that people are going to make bad judgments because of this.\"tragedies also raise difficult ethical issues for the people cybercasting the events.\"the kind of story i don't want to happen is the story that happened last week,\" said mountainzone's potterfield. the site withheld the news of the avalanche for several hours until lowe's and bridges' families could be contacted.\"a lot of people thought we should have gone with the news instantaneously, because that's what the web can do,\" said potterfield. \"i couldn't do that. i wouldn't want to hear about the death of a loved one on the internet.\""}
