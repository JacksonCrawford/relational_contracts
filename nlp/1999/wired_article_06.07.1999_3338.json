[now], we're taking that same kind of improvement, lower prices, wider availability of software, better performance, and we're bringing that now to server-type computers.\"gates' video testimony began and ended on monday. bristol will call other witnesses.also on monday, judge janet hall dismissed one juror who was late in arriving, reducing the size of the jury to nine from 10.copyright"}
