set of standards. pharmacogenomics is the wave of the future in drug development -- a field of research that many say will change the face of health care by bringing personalized medicine in a few years. but the process of finding individual treatments requires maintaining large databases of genetic information, which inevitably creates privacy issues.experts discussed this bioethics dilemma at a symposium during the 49th annual american society of human genetics conference.it's not as simple as making dna samples anonymous. if, in fact, genetic samples were completely anonymous, they'd be of little use to researchers. identifying markers allow researchers to track trends in genetic variations.the existing guidelines from such organizations as the human genome organization and unesco apply to the previous generation of genetic research. there, a single gene specific to a disease was the focus, rather than variations in genes in the population, as in pharmacogenomics.a longstanding concern has been the possibility of discrimination by a health insurer or an employer against individuals whose genetic makeup indicates they are a prime candidate to contract a disease.but in pharmacogenomics research, gene variations could predict who would or would not respond to certain drugs. many fear that this could result in similar discrimination.\"let me tell you something, folks,\" said michael silber, director of pharmacogenomics and clinical biochemical measurements at pfizer. \"you have something in your hospitals called formularies, in which somebody already discriminates against you because you can't find the drug that might work for you because your health system doesn't use it.\"however, if you can get personalized medicine so that we can identify which medicine is effective for you and that you'll have less side effects for, there's no pharmacist in the world who's going to discriminate against you by not putting it on their formulary,\" he added.\"and if they start to do that, my suggestion is to go to law school, because you will make a mint.\"pharmacogenomics research requires information about the potential target for a drug, and then tries to identify who will respond to it.\"it is not a diseased-gene test,\" said allen roses, vice president of glaxo wellcome. \"it uses the same gene tools, but there's no diseased-gene information.\"therefore, some experts say there may be reason to loosen some of the guidelines dictating how many identifying markers should be attached to dna data.bartha knoppers, chairman of the international ethics committee of human genome organization, said more than 70 different statements from countries around the world now exist in an attempt to provide an ethical guideline on genetic testing.both hugo and the national bioethics advisory commission have recently issued statements specifically addressing dna banking.\"hopefully, we're at the end of the state of confusion,\" knoppers said.\"hugo is concerned that if you do anonymize by removing all identifiers, you can never trace back to the person,\" knoppers said. \"potentially, you lose some very valuable data. even though it may be appropriate in certain circumstances, caution should be exercised in that this is an irreversible strip of identifiers and it may preclude valuable use of the sample long-term.\"to solve this problem, nbac has come up with two controversial suggestions. one suggests allowing the dna data to be traced back to the person in case that research on the same condition is pursued in the future.knoppers said a second \"revolutionary\" option suggests \"we don't know what the research will be, can we contact you when we get there?\"this certainly creates more scientific advantages, but it might create burdens and obligations you might not anticipate,\" knoppers said. \"[researchers] will have to go back and contact those people and communicate with them.\"study subjects can now choose whether their information will be identified or not, even though all samples are identified during the study so that clinical data can be linked. after that, the sample is destroyed or stripped of identifiers and banked indefinitely.non-identified samples are stripped of all information, and not even the study subject can access the data.some researchers suggest that the term \"genetic testing\" is not accurate in the case of pharmacogenomics.\"we need to really use the term genetic testing [carefully],\" roses said. \"otherwise, we're going to end up with the same situation of hysteria [surrounding] genetically modified foods.\"in any case, roses said pharmacogenomics research is something that can benefit all patients.\"it's very, very simple,\" roses said. \"when you go to the doctor, you only really want four things: you want a 100 percent accurate diagnosis, you want a drug that is going to work 100 percent of the time, you want zero percent side effects, and you want it for free.\"we'll work on the first three.\""}
