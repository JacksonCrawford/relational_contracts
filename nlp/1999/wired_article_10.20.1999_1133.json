[we wanted to see] what happens if the damaged occurred early on.\"though the scientists focused their research on just two patients, bechara said the findings were solid enough to make a case for the effects of early-onset damage to the prefrontal cortex. \"even if you have only a few cases, these findings are usually very robust. you can make inferences from them.\"though the findings are part of a preliminary study, bechara is enthusiastic about its meaning for the study of the neurological basis for moral and social development.maybe one day antisocial behavior could be viewed like diabetes, where [patients] have a missing chemical, and you need to replace or replenish this chemical and then they can behave normally -- like schizophrenia, or any other psychiatric ailment that can be treated or handled.\""}
