"there are all kinds of fetishes: high heels, leather, latex-clad teenaged she-male amputees. caity mcpherson has a geek fetish.the ceo of samantha's online galleries has been making a splash around silicon valley with her tech girls pictorials, which pose semi-clothed models against familiar tech landmarks. the guerilla photo shoots on mcpherson's juicy mango site have gotten her a lot of attention.\"why shouldn't nerds have their own porn?\" asks mcpherson, a self-professed lover of nerd culture. \"silicon valley is so stuffy, so professional. people around the world put the valley on this pedestal. i just want to break down the walls a bit and have a little fun with that image.\"to that end, mcpherson and her models pose against such ubiquitous valley landmarks as signs for xerox, lycos, and snap.com.\"people see these signs every day driving on the highway or back and forth to work,\" says mcpherson. \"it's exciting to them to see this really familiar landmark with a hot babe in front of it. a lot of those pictures get passed around a lot of offices.\"perhaps a little too much: mcpherson has taken down photos from epri and sun after receiving cease-and-desist letters. mindful of her dangerous mission, mcpherson snaps images on the run before security can be alerted.\"still, it's amazing how lax security is at some of these places,\" she said. \"we took pictures at hewlett-packard and there was a security guard right there, asleep in his van!\"nonetheless, a few techie employees have actually offered to let mcpherson inside their companies for a shoot, sometimes after hours.mcpherson recently decided to push her nerd fetish even further with her geek next door competition. she's looking for hotties at high tech companies who will doff their clothes for the chance to be ogled by geek-lovers.\"i'm looking for women who work in the high tech world who are interested and willing to come out of the closet as sexy women,\" says mcpherson. \"my ideal candidate is an engineer who works for yahoo, who is super smart and cute and willing to tell her story, with no company names named.\"she says the geeks who work in the valley are intrigued by porn that exposes the lust beneath the valley's professional demeanor.mcpherson's geek-centered focus is a rarity on the web, but she says she's just doing what comes naturally. the native californian witnessed the birth and boom of the valley's tech industry, with a grandfather who owned one of the valley's early semiconductor companies. mcpherson's resume boasts credits from a major semiconductor company along with experience as a dancer at san francisco's women-owned lusty lady night club.\"i really wanted to combine my interests in the adult industry and the high-tech industry,\" mcpherson says. \"i'm a geek to the bone.\"with that in mind, mcpherson cobbled together credit from maxed-out cards, cashed in her 401k, and launched juicy mango in 1998. the profitable site has 500 members who shell out monthly fees to see the tech girls pictorials and other images, streaming video feeds, and interviews with adult industry figures.that profitability is a relative rarity today. running a porn site is no longer the easy money it was in the early days of the web, and it's particularly rough going for a site like mcpherson's. her sites avoid the typical generic porn fare of big breasts and blank stares.mcpherson's personal attention to customer service is part of her success. she promptly answers all the email sent to the site and is careful to charge customers properly for access, a far cry from fly-by-night sites that double- and triple-charge customers and provide no contact information for webmasters.partially in response to these kinds of unscrupulous sites, mcpherson and colleague ben feldman launched bay area adult sites, a monthly gathering of adult site webmasters and affiliates looking to exchange ideas, compare notes, and network. enterprises like bay area adult sites and mcpherson's own impeccable business practices have earned her a sparkling reputation in her industry.\"caity is an incredibly down-to-earth and friendly person as well as being incredibly ambitious,\" feldman says about his colleague. \"she cares deeply about legitimizing the online adult business.\"collaborator kacy (who'd prefer her last name to remain private), a member of bay area adult sites and the webmaster of certified amateurs and website girls, also praises mcpherson to the skies.\"she has a really great business head on her shoulders,\" kacy says. \"she's really professional. everybody just loves her because she has such a personal style and is such a great business woman.\"mcpherson says her reputation is one of the reasons why juicy mango is now turning a profit.\"i just wanted to make a good site and i'm a geek so it's really geeky too,\" she says. \"my customers are happy and i'm making money, so i'm happy too.\"see the latest entertainment photossee
