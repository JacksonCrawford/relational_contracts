yes. an ebenezer scrooge called federal reserve chairman alan greenspan.\"there are two potential culprits standing in the way of the santa claus rally,\" said manley. \"strong interest rates and a strong economy could cause real problems for the market.\"the central bank chief is convinced that inflation monsters are coming back to bite the economy and greenspan appears set to pull the interest-rate trigger again.wall street will be on pins and needles going into the next meeting of the fed's interest rate-setting group on dec. 21.experts say the worst thing that could happen for the market would be for consumer spending to speed up and for the economy to continue to growth, despite three interest-rate increases since last june, which were aimed at putting the brakes on the economy.\"that's the kind of stuff that could end a bull market,\" said manley. \"right now i would characterize the scenario as only a risk that i have worry about, but not one that would force me to protect myself against.\"so far, greenspan has failed to talk the economy down, despite his contention that he has done the right thing at the right time with the right amount of force to snuff out inflation.the stock market also hasn't bought the fed head's line because inflation is still incredibly low.allen sinai, chief global economist for primark decision economics inc., said this summer's rate increases, totaling three quarters of a percentage point, are at the ``edge'' of what historically has been needed to get the job done.but the fed may have to revisit its game plan because things are different in this \"new age economy.\" productivity remains high and inflation is still low after almost nine years of growth.\"the us economy is extremely good at evading and avoiding the restraint of higher interest rates,\" he said. \"the system finds ways to minimize the cost of higher interest rates and to maintain the flows-of-funds from lenders to spenders and borrowers.\"he said the fed will also have a tougher job than ever before in fighting inflation.\"this time around, the number of financial intermediaries outside the federal reserve span of control is much greater than previously,\" sinai said.\"also, the rest-of-the-world economy is beyond the scope of the us central bank, leaving open the possibility that a big worldwide boom could contribute to higher us inflation and prolong the time before tighter money could hold back the economy and reduce inflation,\" he said.the fed also has to be preoccupied with the fall-out overseas from its domestic policy.the pacific rim countries and japan are growing gray hairs, worried that if greenspan is able to slow the us economy, then he could take down their economies, which are starting to get back on their feet after a recession.\"higher interest rates by the us fed can also affect capital flows and can puncture the stock markets in asia because higher returns on u.s. investments such as treasury bills makes it harder for the asians to attract money,\" said paul d. mcnelis, professor of economics at georgetownasia's biggest argument is that if greenspan succeeds in capping this country's growth, he would cut american demand for its goods.the american consumers' appetite for foreign stuff has been so hot that it has driven the us trade deficit to a record $25 billion this year, while helping to fuel asia's rebound.in particular, japan is troubled by the rise in its currency, the yen, to a four-year high against the dollar. the yen has been on the ascent since a burst of economic growth in the first quarter shored up an economy that had been in a downward spiral for five quarters -- a record string of consecutive declines.now, there's concern the fast-rising yen could be a serious threat to the recovery of the world's second largest economy.all of those things are on the table. happy stock picking.copyright"}
