inevitable transformation of music distribution. a wireless future and net delivery mean hard choices for the recording industry association of america. by christopher jones.", "author": "christopher

the recording industry association of america has become the internet's biggest rubbernecker. if its lucrative cd business goes the way of 8-tracks and cassettes, the industry will have to adopt a music delivery mechanism that appeals to consumers for quality and service, and to artists for security and royalties. what that magical compromise will be is the question.right now, the answer looks to be some mix of encryption and digital-rights management, as suggested by ibm's electronic music management system and microsoft's new media technologies 4.0 platform. the microsoft architecture creates file sizes about half those of mp3s and includes a system for artists to receive compensation as their work is sent around the net.read wired news' ongoing mp3 coveragebrowse webmonkey's mp3 guide- - - - - -the riaa is plodding along with its development of a secure delivery format for online music -- the secure digital music initiative -- and eventually it hopes to create some order out of the chaos.consumers will help decide which of the growing number of formats, channels, and services will win. while the immediate future for delivering online music will be based on downloads, some recording industry gurus see it as a shortsighted vision that will one day be subsumed by more convenient and efficient services.jim griffin, who was chief technology officer at geffen from 1994 to 1997 and is now the ceo of onehouse, consults with businesses interested in delivering all kinds of intellectual property assets over the internet. his clients are some of the biggest and most influential entertainment companies in the world, from tech companies like microsoft to major recording labels. they look to griffin for advice about what the future holds for delivering artistic assets online.griffin says that downloading files is a primitive delivery method that will give way to subscription-based broadcast models providing consumers ubiquitous access to their services.\"the flat-fee pull world is the way music is headed. music will be a service, not a product,\" said griffin. \"as wireless connectivity delivers what we want, wherever we want, our desire to own digits decreases.... nothing is more certain, and it's happening as we speak.\" in this world of \"ubiquitous access to digits,\" consumers would have broadband access to music, whether from portable devices, home stereos, or desktop pcs. by aggregating content, the major labels could offer music services that let consumers customize channels in whatever fashion they like, and pay a monthly, all-you-can-eat fee similar to the broadcast models used by aol and hbo.one big advantage to this model, said griffin, is that it would virtually eliminate music piracy. \"nobody ever offered me a pirated copy of a seinfeld show, but look at how valuable that intellectual property is. nobody remembers paying for it, but they paid a little something.\"this undercurrent of change is already underway as companies like broadcast.com and spinner.com -- an internet music service with more than 100 \"channels,\" ranging from bluegrass to jungle genres -- build their subscriber bases and ramp up their infrastructures.also rapidly gaining momentum is the shoutcast underground, in which novice djs are taking nullsoft's easy-to-use server tools and broadcasting their play lists in mp3 format to whomever will listen. the beastie boys' label, grand royal, uses shoutcast to promote its artist lineup, and the label has plans for interviews and live broadcasts.so how will record companies maneuver in the next few years as the online delivery market develops?\"the industry is in such a transitory period right now, and isn't concerned so much about the next three years. what they are concerned about is 10 years from now,\" eric scheirer, editor of the mpeg4 standard and a researcher at mit's media lab.marc geiger, ceo of artist direct, is building a music company meant to provide a direct connection between artists and consumers, who will buy all the products they want from one central band site. he has already signed the rolling stones, tom petty, marilyn manson, and korn, as well as other multiplatinum bands.geiger agrees with griffin's predictions about the future for online delivery, noting that both downloaded and encrypted files are a nuisance for the consumer.\"in the next five years, you'll start to see higher-bandwidth connections, and as that happens, you'll see a shift in the economy of the music business.... we'll need to figure out other revenue streams to make up for this loss of value. in the short term, it's going to be a nightmare,\" geiger said.the first wave of online music resellers is hoping to cash in until the infrastructure that supports ubiquitous access model arrives. by undercutting the cd market for albums that cost less than us$10, they are tempting consumers to change their buying habits and gear up with portable players like the rio. goodnoise, one of the few online music vendors offering straight-up mp3 files, is locking up artists and labels to exclusive electronic-delivery deals for the next five to 10 years, and has recruited some big-name indie acts such as frank black and they might be giants. steve grady, vice president of marketing at goodnoise, said the technical infrastructure for ubiquitous access is a long way down the road, and has some significant cultural barriers to overcome.\"streaming is important and will gain steam, but i'm not convinced that it will ever be the way people use music,\" said grady. \"in terms of how people use music today, we're talking about a good next step and one that matches how people want their music. maybe 15 years from now [ubiquitous access services will be possible]. but in the meantime, there is a lot of money to be made on downloading music.\"andrew milne, vice president of development at a2b, thinks that streaming is a good promotional format, but that it doesn't have the same ownership value as downloaded files.\"there are a variety of ways that people want to enjoy music, just as they do video programming. we're focused on the concept of downloads to either a portable or computer, getting music into a form where you own it and control what you can do with it,\" said milne.whether through downloading or streaming music, the business -- including products surrounding music -- is sure to grow to two or three times its current size.\"the distribution chain is being wasted on delivering digits on a plastic disc,\" said griffin. \"once freed up, we can sell items associated with music that have higher margins. it's actually a better business to not sell the content. selling items associated with the music is where it's at.\""}
