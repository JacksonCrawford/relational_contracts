the cheerful advice of a leading analyst. and net shares get even nuttier. by david lazarus.", "author": "david lazarus", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "01.08.1999 02:10 PM", "text": "wall street blasted back into record territory friday, fueled by the unbeatable combination of strong economic data, upbeat sentiment from an influential analyst, and internet shares going bonkers. it also didn't hurt that telecom heavyweight at&t chimed in with some sweet earnings news.the dow jones industrial average rose 105.56 points to close at 9643.32, topping 9600 for the first time ever, and the s&p 500 was 5.43 higher at 1275.16. the nasdaq composite index gained 18.82 to 2344.91, and the wired index was up 7.57 at 626.28. once again, these were all record-high closes.it must be quite an ego boost to know you can single-handedly move the market. on thursday, goldman sachs' abby joseph cohen flexed her muscle with some cautious advice that investors trim back the stock allocation in their portfolios. a day later, ralph acampora of prudential securities challenged this notion by recommending that investors place every last penny into stocks. the market slowed when cohen spoke, and then rallied once again on acampora's words.a few of the more faint-hearted folk attempted to spark a sell-off in the late afternoon, but the bulls won out in the end. enthusiasm was underpinned by a report from the us labor department showing that the unemployment rate fell to 4.3 percent in december and averaged just 4.5 percent for all of 1998 -- the lowest peacetime level since 4.3 percent in 1957. in all, employers added approximately 378,000 jobs to their payrolls last year.while stocks reacted to this good news by advancing pretty much across the board, turbocharged internet shares were out in front as investors maintained their damn-the-torpedoes commitment to throwing money at the .com crowd.\"institutions aren't the ones driving this thing,\" said steve franco, an analyst with piper jaffray. \"it's the retail investors.\"interestingly, he's not talking about the day traders, who usually get the blame whenever internet stocks punch holes in the ozone layer. these days, franco noted, the ones cashing in on momentum plays are the mom-and-pop investors who used to stick to the time-honored practice of buying and holding.\"that's changed because a lot of the retail investors are switching to online brokerages,\" he said. \"the online brokers have lower commissions and more research. by lowering the pain threshold for being able to trade, people are trading more often.\"case in point: charles schwab's site crashed for about 15 minutes in the morning as record usage swamped the system. lengthy delays continued throughout the day.as for high-priced internet shares, franco said it will take more than technical glitches to cool investors' jets. \"there's hasn't been enough pain inflicted to spook people,\" he observed. \"it's going to take a yahoo or amazon coming up with some disappointments.\"can we expect that any time soon?\"not this quarter,\" franco replied.indeed, eagerness for net stocks is building as the market awaits the latest quarterly earnings from yahoo (yhoo), to be released next tuesday. the company is expected to report profit of 16 cents a share, and to show big increases in numbers of visitors and advertising revenue. while yahoo's success is still more the exception than the rule for online outfits, it's regarded as a bellwether of the industry's health.yahoo rose us$23.63 to $343.63. rival excite (xcit) gained $4.69 to $60, and lycos (lcos), soon-to-be parent of wired news, was up $20.25, or 28 percent, at $91.75. broadcast.com (bcst) vaulted $65.50, or 50 percent, to $197.50 for no better reason than having dazzled analysts at a new york investment conference.geocities (gcty) jumped $14, or 34 percent, to $54.88 after saying it had cut a deal to license new e-commerce technology, paving the way for introduction of a new cyber-mall. etrade group (egrp), meanwhile, was up $3.56 at $67.63 as the online broker's customer trading volume continues to rise, while amazon.com (amzn) inched up $1.38 to $160.25.in telecom, at&t (t) climbed $2.81 to $85.06 after saying it expects 1999 profits to come in as high as $4.30 a share, well ahead of the $4.09 expected by analysts. separately, rumors circulated that the telco may be negotiating with microsoft to acquire the microsoft network and other media assets. usa today said that while there's no deal planned for the immediate future, something still could gel in months ahead.speculation is still mounting as to mci worldcom's (wcom) intentions in the bidding war for airtouch communications (ati).although mci said it isn't pursuing a marriage with airtouch \"at this time,\" bloomberg quoted \"people familiar with the companies\" as saying mci would make a stock-for-stock offer that is below the $54 billion offered by vodafone group (vod), but above the $43 billion on the table from bell atlantic (bel). according to this scenario, mci still would expect to prevail because airtouch's managers and investors would rather own shares of mci than vodafone. we'll see.mci shed 13 cents to $75, and vodafone was down $3.13 at $173.13. bell atlantic rose 63 cents to $56.63, but airtouch was $3 lower at $79.one last telecom nugget: cable & wireless (cwp) jumped $3.31 to $43.31 amid rumors that britain's second-biggest phone company may merge with deutsche telekom. why not? everyone else is doing it.tech shares firmed a bit following a report from market researcher pc data that december sales of personal computers in the united states increased 41 percent, even as average prices dropped 20 percent. total pc sales for the month reached about $1 billion.but the outlook for the industry remains uncertain, with some analysts still anticipating consolidation among manufacturers. dell computer (dell) fell 38 cents to $77.81, and international business machines (ibm) was down $2.69 at $187.50. compaq computer (cpq) gained 81 cents to $45.38, while apple computer (aapl) was unchanged at $45.lastly, a pulse-taking of asia's economic well-being. never mind such benchmarks as industrial output or employment. the more important gucci (guc) factor suggests that asian markets are clearly on the mend.the italian maker of expensive stuff said increased demand out of parts east is partly the reason for a 23-percent hike in sales over the past couple of months. this, plus an improved outlook for the latest quarter, sent gucci's shares up $7.44, or 11 percent, to $74.88."}
