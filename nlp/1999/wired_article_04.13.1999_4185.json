what did they do this time?\"it seems the pair had a long and sordid history in the immigration law community. after some research in the organization's membership files, i learned that they had been the subject of disciplinary action in florida some years earlier and had been thrown out of the association long before they fled to arizona and discovered the art of spamming.my crash course in spam marked a turning point: by the time i left the office late that night, i would emerge from my cubicle a man with a new mission and a chip on his shoulder.that chip looked suspiciously like a block of pink lunch meat.much has changed since then. i received my license to practice law, and canter and siegel lost theirs. meanwhile, spammers have gotten more prolific and highly sophisticated.i realize now that i was one of the first computer professionals to experience the feeling of dread evoked by a flood of spam complaints. i have never quite forgotten that feeling, and it is part of the reason i have spent so much of these last several years combating internet abuse.thinking back on the details of the green card lottery, i recall my puzzlement when i first learned the address to which would-be immigrants should address their lottery entries.the submission address was a post office box in a place called \"dulles, virginia.\" as a resident of northern virginia, i knew that no such place existed. upon further investigation, i learned that it was an address created specifically for a large postal processing facility built in the early 1990s near dulles international airport.followers of internet business, however, will already recognize dulles as the new mailing address for the headquarters of america online and the location of a massive new data center to house the east coast operations of uunet and mci worldcom.i will leave it to the reader's own imagination to assess the cosmic irony of a town created to service floods of postal mail becoming home to a large chunk of the internet's infrastructure.ray everett-church is an internet lawyer with the arlington, virginia-based law firm of related wired links:<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.wired.com/news/images/pix155.gif\"/>safeeps from spam at last?9.oct.98house sides with spammers7.aug.98pro-spam bill derailed30.jul.98house takes up spam bill23.jun.98when spam goes bad13.jul.98senate embraces spam bill18.jun.98"}
