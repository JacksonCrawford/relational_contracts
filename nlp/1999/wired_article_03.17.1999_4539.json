[our] code is open and free. apple's code is open, but it's not free.\"ironically, hass said that apple may have used some of linuxppc's code -- or at least its techniques -- to boost mac os x server's performance.\"it's perfectly fair and legal for apple to do this,\" haas said, \"because our system is free and open. we'll be able to tell when apple makes their code available.\""}
