hours of it. steve kettmann reports from berlin.", "author": "steve kettmann", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "12.06.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "berlin -- it looks at first as if the cameras have been hijacked and a group of mischievous, computer-loving 23-year-olds has taken over a german television show. they talk about cool internet sites and hot new video games, visit chat rooms, and generally carry on and have fun until someone pulls the plug. but no one pulls the plug. nbc giga lasts five hours every afternoon, and it's getting more and more popular throughout germany.a crew of 13 on-air personalities cooped up in a warehouse-like set in dusseldorf take turns talking viewers through web navigation, showing just what they're doing on big screens connected to computers.this is computer training for beginners, and the fresh-faced personalities do everything but show up in living rooms and hit the \"enter\" key.once the information is out there, viewers are encouraged to email or comment in one of the chat rooms, which is always showing on a screen somewhere, giving the show a realistic feel, since what gets typed into the computer at home often matters as much as what one of the hosts wants to say.\"we surf every topic that interests young people, and there's a lot of personal contact with the viewers, via the chat and emails,\" said kerstin linnartz, a former model who is one of the show's 13 on-air personalities. \"the viewers see us every day and get the chance to talk to us. i think they build up kind of a relationship with us.\"that's how it seems to the people at home.\"you feel like you know them,\" said stefan ruppenthal, 28, who works at aol germany's saarbrucken office and watches the show often. \"when you switch the tv on and see nbc giga, you think, 'oh yes, there is georg and kerstin.' it's always the same people on there and they are always nice, every day.\"linnartz and the others try to show viewers the internet is \"not only work,\" but also fun.\"you can see that in the 12 months that we've been doing this show, people in germany are looking more to the internet,\" she said. \"every tv show has its own web site now, and they talk about it on the show. i think it's coming much farther in europe, too. i wonder why there is no show like this in america yet.\" hosts discuss video games, too, and play them. european pop bands appear to talk and sing, and like one doe-eyed, glitter-flecked lead singer recently on the show, engage in a kick-boxing videogame death match. there is also time for entertainment-world news and sports.the program, like most new ventures, does not make money yet, but producers expect to be in the black next year. monthly page views have gone from 900,000 in its first full month last december to 10 million in october.\"we focus a lot more on online reach than on tv reach,\" said program director ollie weiberg. \"we have almost 100,000 registered community users. we have 50,000 who use our free email. and for the reach of the tv show, every day we have between 200,000 and 300,000 people.\"handheld cameras and tight shots are nearly constant, but it's all in good fun. the personalities don't take themselves too seriously, and are chosen to look presentable and sexy in a low-key way.even the glamorous veronika ring, the only austrian, insists she and the others are ordered to dress in pretty much whatever tumbles out of their closet on a given day.the show is not scripted, said george zaal, one of the show's games experts, who, fittingly enough, looks a little like the arch-villain kane from \"command and conquer.\"\"we just talk when we want to talk. one time, i was on the air and one of the guys came out and put aftershave on my head. some people think we should be more serious, but i think it's fun.\"the 13 personalities each receive several hundred emails a day, and they give them all at least a perfunctory answer -- those that deserve one, anyway.\"i would say 90 percent of them are flattering,\" said ring. \"sometimes they say, 'i hate you, you're a foreigner,' and sometimes they are really dirty, or nazis, people with stupid brains.\"some viewers boast about never missing a day, and the web site encourages devoted fans with photos and lists of likes and dislikes for each personality. ring's favorite movies are pulp fiction and when harry met sally. linnartz, a german-looking sandra bullock type, lists madonna and the dalai lama as people she would like to meet.the 13 hosts also write for the web site. emily whigham works the \"stars\" beat and recently wrote a piece on bruce willis. below the piece are 18 links, enough to more than satisfy anyone's curiosity -- and inspire feedback.\"this show is very innovative compared to america,\" whigham said. \"it's not a planned show. if we have a topic that we think is going to work, and it doesn't, because of the interaction of people, then we have to change and try something else. the stuff that is said in the chatroom i will talk about on the air again, so it's like a circle. the whole thing doesn't work if one of the elements doesn't work.\"there's always room for improvement. ruppenthal, the big fan of the show who works for aol, suggests having guest experts on topics like computer networks (he's available). but nbc giga is faithful to its subject -- and it forges new ground.\"i think we have really invented something here,\" said weiberg, the program director. \"we do this a whole new way. we have been evolving from the very first day. we are growing, just like the internet is growing, and every day there is something new.\""}
