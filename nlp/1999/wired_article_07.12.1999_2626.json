a benchmark tool to show nonprofits just how tech-savvy they are; and some type of technology exchange where donors and nonprofits can meet, cohen said.the proposed technology exchange, he said, would reside online and act as a \"clearinghouse or a place that would bring together hardware and software makers and nonprofit groups and groups that assist nonprofits ... with technology.\"the report's initiatives stemmed from the frustrations of microsoft, hewlett-packard, and the packard foundation -- companies anxious to ensure their respective software, hardware, and training donations would be used as effectively as possible, said cohen.\"the donations would be linked to training so that you would know how to use what you get.\"another proposal is a benchmark tool currently in beta that will allow nonprofits to gauge how well their organizations are using technology, said joan fanning, executive director for npower, a seattle-based technology assistance provider.the web-based tool will issue nonprofits a \"technology report card\" based on their answers to questions about how they use technology, she said. it will also provide model answers to the questions and will link to additional resources on the web.npower was also born of microsoft's philanthropic arm, fanning said. the organization is modeled on other nonprofit technology assistance providers throughout the country, such as the information technology resource center, the fund for the city of new york, and compumentor. npower makes its business model available to nonprofits looking to help other nonprofits with technology.cohen said that nsnt will probably be dissolved after presenting its findings, since it will have completed its mission. based on the discussions at the conference, a new group will be formed to make sure the principles and initiatives outlined in the report are enacted.the help could not come soon enough, cohen said. at a time when corporate consolidation and the government's \"less is more\" policy toward charities has put the squeeze on nonprofits, they could use a hand getting plugged into technology.\"technology is one of the most powerful tools to help the sector strengthen itself and become more effective, at a time when the sector is challenged to do more with less.\""}
