(by contrast, using the serial port took an hour and 45 minutes.) slide this mp3 monster back into your dash, and you're ready to roll.since it's linux, there's a cute penguin logo on the startup screen, and if you've updated your tracks via a net music database, the song titles scroll by while they're playing. on the road, i found the four buttons on the front panel clumsy. left and right arrows double up for track skip and volume control, so i managed to alternately blast my ears out and zip through the entire playlist in seconds. the down button opens menu options such as digital radio, graphic equalizer, and track arrangement; the up button pauses the song. using the remote control, with its separate buttons for each function, was easiest - and extremely practical if you tap empeg car's audio line out to plug it into your living-room hi-fi. losing your grip on the remote control behind the wheel is another matter entirely. cue mr. bean fumbling around the floor while driving down the freeway.4-gbyte empeg car: $1,099. empeg: +44 (1223) 576123, fax +44 (1223) 576124, street credrest in inner peacerip-and-roll highwaybiodetectivemagic markershead triphelping handelectric avenuereadmemusicpocket portalwords for windowsthe boy mechanicspin doctorsjust outta betathrash and burnthe long view on short-term profiteerscontributors"}
