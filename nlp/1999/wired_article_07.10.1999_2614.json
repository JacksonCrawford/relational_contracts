(if it's at ups.com, it ain't easy to find.)last and probably least: ok, so here's the hottest issue -- honest -- at the adult video expo, which ran simultaneously with the vsda's main gig. \"condom videos vs. non-condom videos. the industry's hottest issue will be presented, with a slant on merchandising of both types of product,\" according to vsda literature. another hot topic: \"zoning -- battleground for the next century\", with a distinct slant toward surviving \"bad zoning decisions.\" ahem."}
