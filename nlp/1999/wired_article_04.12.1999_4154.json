the south carolina network administrator couldn't resist the chance to read the script when it landed in his hands.\"i did read it. it was the holy grail, and i had been chasing it for awhile,\" linder said. \"it reads like a sweeping epic, with high drama, intense action, and a touch of sincere humor.\"the two men are contributors to theforce.net, one of thousands of sites dedicated to star wars fandom, but quite possibly the most popular and deepest site of the genre. launched in 1996 when founders scott chitwood and darin smith were roommates at texas a&m university, theforce.net is a hobby that commands full-time attention from its 13 contributors.one of their colleagues -- whom neither ens nor linder would name -- claims to have obtained the script from someone selling it out of the trunk of a car at a science fiction convention. both consider it authentic. \"obviously, there were very few people with access to the entire thing. it's marked in a way it could be linked to the source if it got back to george lucas. he would know where it came from,\" linder said.regardless of the script's origin, there is no denying the strength of theforce.net's spies. they have delivered to fans a steady diet of sneak peaks, hints, and outright spoilers as the movie has developed. one spy gained entry to leavesden studios in england to snap photos of the sets. others work for the companies involved with the film's promotion or for lucasfilm ltd. itself.many are motivated by the simple fact \"that they just can't keep a secret,\" ens said.\"we have two movies left to go, so i don't want to say too much about how we find our spies, and of course for some people their jobs are at stake,\" ens said. \"some contacts we've made at conventions or we have friends at lucasfilm who will make unofficial comments. we also have spies who are directly involved with the production, and they come to us.\"and the information they've obtained is catching eyeballs. in three years, the site has become so popular that it has had to change isps half a dozen times, each time leaving overloaded servers in its wake.as many as 40,000 people visit the site each day, reading the latest news and rumors about every aspect of the star wars universe, from toys to books to promotional products.the site is also the official home of kevin rubio's underground short film troops. as the film became a download sensation, traffic on the site tripled, forcing the most recent move and a requisite increase in bandwidth. this in turn sent costs to host the site through the roof. what had begun as a hobby that cost us$40 a month now costs between $2,000 and $3,000 a month. rather than close down, the site struck a banner advertising deal with san francisco-based imagine media, publisher of magazines like pc gamer and mac addict as well as entertainment web site the den. as traffic grew, so did the advertising revenue.\"at first, it was barely covering our costs,\" ens said. \"but now we're starting to see a very small profit.\"any profit not used to cover the site's costs will be donated to charities, such as organizations involved with diabetes research. presumably, star wars creator george lucas, who is diabetic, would approve, and that's the idea.\"there's always a worry that he might sue us,\" ens said.lucasfilm recently sued the publisher of an unauthorized guidebook to the star wars universe, and ens said that rumors have leaked that some web sites might be next on the list.but for the time being, it seems they have little to worry about.\"we love theforce.net,\" said lynne hale, director of communications for lucasfilm. \"it's pretty much our policy that as long as they are using the copyrighted images and materials to show their enthusiasm and not making money, then that is fine. as long as they are just fans having fun, then that's great. remember, our fans have stuck with us for 20 years.\"the fans are a determined lot. all have jobs or are students, and all are expected to work hard for their particular areas of the site, ens said. that can take time.\"this is really a side project for all us,\" he said \"some of us are able to integrate it with our jobs, but between us and the times of day we work, we have almost 24-hour coverage of the site.linder agreed. \"it's like trying to work one full time job, manage my personal life, and work a second job as a professional star wars fan. if we could figure out a way to do this full time it would be a blessing.\""}
