chat is not necessarily cheaper than paying aol to use its chat rooms. but to sign up with aol you must provide your credit card or checking account number and, by extension, your real name, address, and telephone number.for millions of people, this is acceptable. but for others, freedom in the form of anonymity is something to be cherished.__ john baichtaljohn@baichtal.com ____ bugged out __lisa margonelli's description of aol's community leaders (\"inside aol's 'cyber-sweatshop,'\" wired 7.10, page 138) reminded me of what it was like to work as a beta tester for microsoft, which i did for a few years until i decided the company was getting the best of the deal. they got in touch with me, flattered the hell out of me, told me how great and wonderful it was for me to be exposed to their new technology. the microsofties ended up motivating me to think i was on a great and noble crusade, and i pissed away hours and hours testing, isolating, and reporting all their damnable bugs. maybe there should be a class-action suit against redmond on behalf of all its beta testers.__ ben myersbenmyers@ma.ultranet.com ____ literary industrial complex __john brockman incites all independent authors to participate in a sort of intifada against publishing houses that are dominated by media conglomerates (\"agent provocateur,\" wired 7.09, page 98). i live in brazil, where many editors are puppets of the same conglomerates, and brockman's outcry is music to my ears.the concept of replacing the conservative, industrial publishing process with cost-cutting, inventive, digital distribution signifies the end of the best-seller profitability model, and the beginning of wider access to all creative literature. it will no longer matter where the writer and reader are located. amazing.__ ilidio soaresilidioso@zip.net __i loved the quote by john brockman: \"companies are like roach motels. good people go in, and nothing comes out.\" i have seen this for myself over and over again. it goes a long way toward explaining why anything microsoft produces is so full of bugs!__ david cookdcook@cookware.com ____ burn rate __in \"virtual book burning\" (wired 7.09, page 68), mike romano takes amazon.com to task for removing the committee from amazon.co.uk and temporarily pulling a piece of blue sky from its us site, noting that \"the church of scientology has been aggressively going after online content it deems objectionable.\"the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles is also pressuring amazon.com, as well as barnesandnoble.com, to remove quite a few books from its german site, and there is no outcry. the center claims the booksellers are breaking german law by carrying mein kampf, the protocols for the learned elders of zion, and other titles. (it is illegal to distribute literature that supports nazi ideology in germany.)should amazon.com be liable in a german court for selling mein kampf? if so, surely it might be liable in an iranian court for selling salman rushdie's the satanic verses. do we want a truly open internet, with any information available to anyone, anywhere? bomb-making manuals, hate literature, pornography, free tibet sites, rushdie novels: all could be illegal in one country or another.__ tom coxtough_tom@yahoo.com ____ spamtrak __i wanted to thank you for your report on globaltrak (\"anatomy of a spam,\" wired 7.10, page 144). while it wasn't very flattering to me personally, i think it was a very good portrayal of the company. all of the licensees with me were, and still are, friends. like me, they wanted to save the world and make a difference. i was hurt financially and emotionally when it became clear that the promises were pipe dreams. if your article can stop one other person from spending a dime on this venture and others like it, it would be well worth it. i know i speak for all of us when i say thank you and kudos for a great job!and my suit, by the way, was not cheap.__ daniel k. holmesdanielkh@aol.com ____ the zero effect __i've just finished kevin kelly's \"the roaring zeros\" (wired 7.09, page 150), and i'm flabbergasted that a seemingly educated, intelligent person could be so naive. forget about current market conditions and futuristic hand-waving. history teaches us that inevitably the good times come to an end, no matter what. arrogant optimism fueled by technology brings to mind the mood at the end of the last century, and what was the result? the titanic and world war i, to name but two. prosperity and growth are by no means bad things, but they are no guarantee, nor are they a birthright.__ warren freywfrey@powersurfr.com __so the dow will hit 50,000 and everything shall be peachy forever? in fact, you say, we will be able to buy lots more of everything, and even have our own personal assistants.but who is this \"we\" who will have gaggles of personal assistants? certainly not the personal assistants themselves. so this \"we\" must be a privileged upper class of technocrats with several layers of subservient drones doing their work for them. how utopian!it's an oft-proved truism on wall street that when the mass media starts running front-page stories about how the good times will go on forever, it's time to short the market.__ bob morrisbob@bomoco.com ____ undo __hardwired: waldo jaquith's 384k connection (\"bell hop,\" wired 7.09, page 36) is a multiple virtual line, not wireless. ... retrained: bombardier was not involved in alstom's development of the tgv in france (\"power trip,\" wired 7.09, page 50). ... un-finnished: yrj\u00f6 neuvo was a professor at the tampere university of technology, not the university of tampere (\"just say nokia,\" wired 7.09, page 134). additionally, finland has never had a fully socialist economy.__ send your rants & raves to: __email: rants@wiredmag.comsnail mail: wired, po box 191826 san francisco, ca 94109-9866editorial guidelines: guidelines@wiredmag.comeditorial correspondence: editor@wiredmag.com"}
