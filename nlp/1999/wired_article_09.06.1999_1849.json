- - - -japanese feminists have been fighting with the ministry of health and welfare on the pill issue since they first applied for its approval 10 years ago. but the stodgy health ministry has always tried to keep it off the shelves.in june, after the ministry swiftly ruled to legalize viagra, officials finally relented. women's groups and the four female health ministers, furious over the favored treatment for a male impotence drug, demanded that it was time to bring in the pill.\"the crux of the problem comes from the fact that in japan, everything is controlled by the men's perspective,\" says keiko yamanaka, a research associate at the institute for the study of social change at the university of california, berkeley.yamanaka thinks the pill wasn't approved earlier because japanese men do not trust women to make choices about their own sexuality and reproductive rights.\"men think that women would go wild. and that would undermine the very basis of the japanese family and gender roles,\" she says.the 12 pharmaceutical firms supplying the pill are bracing themselves for a tough marketing campaign. yamanouchi pharmaceutical co. of tokyo estimates that only 2 percent of japanese women will be using the pill by the end of 2000.the company has to overcome several social stigmas to popularize the pill.part of the current disinterest is a fear of the pills' side effects, says hara, a tokyo anthropologist and university lecturer. \"some fear that the pill can cause health problems, like hormonal imbalances.\"\"the pill is bad for you,\" said kazuko baba, a tokyo department store salesperson in her early 30s, who confided over email that she would never take the pill for contraceptive purposes.the health ministry has widely publicized the negative health effects of the pill, leaving some people with an exaggerated perception of the pills' risks.another misconception is that the pill is only for treating health problems. medium and high-dose birth control pills, considered more risky than low-dose pills, have been legally prescribed to japanese women with menstrual problems for years. japanese couples will also need to shift from their attachment to the condom, currently the most widely used form of contraception. one recent survey publicized by a feminist politician concluded that 90 percent of unmarried people and 78 percent of married couples use condoms.noriko, a 29-year-old tokyo office worker who asked that her last name not be used, staunchly defended the condom as preventor of sexually transimitted diseases.\"we hear horror stories on the news of sexual relationships between high-school students on the pill and older men. they got chlamydia and hiv afterwards.\"gynecologists and feminists hope that the legalization of the pill will cut down on japan's abortion rate.dr. jim nishimine, a berkeley-based gynecologist and obstetrician, says the demand for the pill has always existed among japanese women who are sexually active, and legalization will definitely reduce the number of abortions.even if oral contraceptives don't become mainstream right away, pharmaceutical firms expect they will be able to build a sizeable market relatively quickly, says yutaka yamada, communications director at yamanouchi. german drug seller schering ag and yamanouchi hope to sell \u00a53 billion worth of pills in the next three years.to reach their goals, drug firms will launch a massive publicity campaign to educate japanese women on the effects of each drug. in june, the health ministry also did its bit, launching an oral contraceptive information center to supply information on each pill to doctors, women, and the media.feminists are concerned that just giving out medical information might not be enough in a culture where women need to be encouraged to ask questions.\"just giving technical instructions to women and japanese girls on how to use the pill is nothing. these are women who are not socialized to talk about their reproductive organs, their genitals, or sexuality,\" said uc berkeley's yamanaka.yamanaka's view reflects the general sentiment among japanese feminists who think the legalization of the pill is the first of many hurdles for women to overcome.\"i think the legalization of the modern-day pill gives japanese women more control over their bodies. but the use of pill is only one part of the whole issues regarding japanese women's individual rights, family planning and reproductive rights.\""}
