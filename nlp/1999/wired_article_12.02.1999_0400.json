friday. but the shadow of the lost mars climate orbiter looms large. by lindsey arent.", "author": "lindsey arent", "category": "science", "type": "article", "timestamp": "12.02.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "pasadena, california -- a wildly expensive robotic spacecraft hurtling toward mars is on its way to freezing itself to death. and that's if the nasa mission is a complete success.project leaders were optimistic as they made their final preparations for the mars polar lander's touchdown at the red planet's south pole, scheduled for noon pst friday.\"a successful landing would be a relief to a great many people,\" said dr. richard zurek, project scientist for the mission. \"it would be the first time we explore these polar regions, and we won't have this chance again.\"nasa has to make several changes to the mission because of the loss of the mars climate orbiter in september. the failure was blamed on a simple metric mix-up.\"it was a big disappointment for everybody, said sarah gavit, project manager for the lander's related deep space 2 mission. \"you learn from that. it causes us to make sure we triple check everything.\"to avoid similar problems, the polar lander crew brought in a team of more than 30 experts to comb through every conceivable problem that could jeopardize the us$120 million mission.the scientists and engineers of the polar lander team -- many of whom worked on the failed mars climate orbiter mission -- said they were more prepared than ever for the rigorous task of landing the craft on the martian surface.\"this team has been under a great deal of scrutiny,\" said project manager dr. john mcnamee during a press conference at nasa's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena. \"[but a new team] has turned over all the rocks and are raking the rubble ... mars polar lander is in excellent condition.\"the mission is the latest step in nasa's long-range program to explore mars, which began in 1996 with the launch of the mars global surveyor, still orbiting the planet, and the subsequent mars pathfinder mission.the polar lander is carrying an arsenal of scientific instruments designed to detect traces of water and to help scientists learn more about the history of mars' climate.\"water is important to find on mars because it's one of the ingredients required for the soup of life,\" said gavit. \"it played an important role in the formation of the planet, and it's a potential resource for the future.\"the equipment will analyze material on the planet's surface, weather patterns, and frost, and examine samples of the layered terrain just beneath the surface of mars.other instruments include a descent camera -- called the mars descent imager, or mardi -- a light detection (lidar) instrument that will observe ice clouds and dust hazes above the lander, and a microphone that will record the sounds of mars.the polar lander is equipped with two \"basketball-sized\" microprobes called deep space 2, that will separate 10 minutes before touchdown, hurtle to the ground, and conduct experiments miles away from the lander.once released, the microprobes will crash beneath the martian surface and perform soil and climate tests as well as tests for signs of vaporized water ice.\"we wanted to build something really small to understand the weather,\" gavit said. \"it's hard to do it with just one station.... this whole lab [an analysis unit inside the microprobe] can fit on your thumb.\"before any of the instruments can go to work, however, the lander must survive the difficult entry into the planet's atmosphere.\"you have to enter at precisely the right angle,\" said norman haynes, former director of the mars program at jpl and a spokesman for the mission. \"if you come in too shallow, you won't land on mars. too steep, you'll come in too fast and you'll overheat. the parachutes have to open, the engines have to fire ... all that has to happen just right. it's tough to do.\"according to plan, the spacecraft will land on the martian terrain with the aid of a parachute, retro rockets, and \"onboard guidance,\" then wait a few minutes for the dust to settle before unfolding the lander's solar energy panels.once the lander calculates its position in relation to earth and adjusts its antenna, project managers hope the lander will then begin to transmit images of its descent back to the jpl.\"we play back those images,\" haynes said. \"it gives you a chance to see the landing site, it gives you some context.\"a second camera, identical to the one used on the 1997 pathfinder mission, is scheduled to record panoramic images of the martian surface. and a third camera, located on the robotic arm, will be used to take microscopic images of scooped up soil to examine what scientists hope will reveal the planet's climatic history.\"the wall of the excavation below the polar area [is believed to have] layers of dust-like tree rings,\" haynes said. \"we'll look at the soil up close.\"the images were originally to have been relayed to earth via the ill-fated mars climate orbiter. instead, the data will be transmitted by the mars global surveyor, or alternatively, through a direct antenna link on the lander itself.\"most contingencies are dealing with the question of 'suppose we can't talk to the lander?'\" zurek said. \"that's our limiting factor.\"at best, the lander is expected to function on mars for 60 to 90 martian days, which last 24 hours and 37 minutes each. after that, the craft is expected to succumb to freezing polar temperatures.even if the landing is successful, there are no guarantees that the data will transmit to earth, or that the instruments will function correctly.\"mars is tough,\" zurek said. \"that imposes inherent risk. we can do everything right [but] we could still lose the mission. that's the nature of the business.\""}
