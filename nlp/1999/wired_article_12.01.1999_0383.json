like the sec and the fcc - and so on. and you know as well that you will have 20 to 25 leaders from the top companies.equally important is that you know you will not be manipulated: we will not suddenly come out with a big davos declaration on behalf of participants that someone cannot subscribe to. and i should add - and now i'm immodest - that you know you will be attending what is probably the best-organized meeting in the world.if that's why people come, what should they leave with?the benchmark of success is if you can say you have answered three questions: one, \"did itake home an idea that will have considerable impact on the future of my country?\" two, \"did i make a contact who will have considerable impact on the future of my country?\" and three, \"did i learn anything that will have considerable impact on my own leadership abilities?\"does davos have competitors?there are other communities of interest but nothing on the scale of davos. the truth is, our real competition is the lack of time: everything that competes for the time and attention of top players is our competitor. in the end, we are not so much in the conference business as in the attention-getting business.there appear to be some intriguing points of tension in what you are doing. on the one hand, there's idealism - namely, the notion that one should do good deeds and help the world. but on the other hand, there is a real fascination with the very practical, dynamic side of simply doing business.i have a business education. in addition, i take a very systematic approach to things. but i have always also had an orientation toward the future, an interest in the creation of something new. so maybe there is a dualism. people ask me what i am - what my role is at davos. when you do such an event, you must act like an artist, but also like a r\u00e9gisseur (stage manager). you choose your actors. you choose your script. you get your audience.and you must choose your vision.yes. it's a highly creative act. if you do something, you have to do it with passion. but i'm aware also that you have to achieve an objective. and you have to be cost conscious and make sure you always have the necessary financial resources. the alternative would be to be subsidized, but then you'd lose your independence. and one of the good things about the world economic forum is that it has always been able to generate enough financial resources to resist losing its independence. i would even go as far as to say that in the whole of our history we have never had to make a compromise. in terms of independence versus financial attractivity, we have always chosen independence.what's the forum's mission in 2000 and beyond?we are living in a world characterized by a number of factors. let me use a few key words: global. complex. technology-driven. interdependent. time-constrained. it's very clear that in such a world, there are more and more challenges, and that those challenges need faster and faster reactions.and yet at the same time, the power wielded by individual governments in this new arena has receded.yes, so the challenges cannot be met by governments alone. most of the challenges require a close cooperation between governments, business, academia, and the media.are there other players?many of today's challenges are created by technology. so you need to integrate technology into this interface. i also feel deeply that there must be a new role for nongovernmental organizations as advocates of civil society. in fact, we are building a new constituency group of ngos. and we look particularly favorably on ngos that may have different opinions.how do you organize such a synergy?my vision for the forum turns on global-policy networks. it's a notion that was coined about two years ago, is now frequently used by world bank president jim wolfensohn, and is also very much part of the thinking of the un. the idea is that the best way to deal with key issues, particularly those still on the horizon - like bioengineering and genetically modified food, the impact of the internet on government, the role of internet-based learning in education, and privacy and the internet - is to put the most knowledgeable and the most influential people together. then ask: what are the possible negative outcomes of an issue? what are the positive aspects? what are the options for action? and what is it possible for the international community to do?so what part exactly does the wef play in all this?we see ourselves as an incubator and a hub for these global-policy networks. we are not necessarily the only originators, because a network may be originated by, for instance, the un or the world bank. but we use our relationships with the world of government, industry, the media, and academia to make these networks happen.is there any analogy in history for these global-policy networks?actually, there are very few models. we are really entering new territory.as i understand it, the total annual revenues of forum members comes to about $6 trillion.that was the last time we made the calculation, about a year and a half ago. we have added some very big players, so it's higher now.could it be that the balance is out of kilter, with business playing too big a role - a role that in the current mercantile boom threatens to overwhelm government, politics, academia, even the media?this is one of life's realities. it's not a moral issue. it's just an economic fact. let's take the media: to a large extent, 10 media groups control the capital base of the world media. this tells us they should be integrated into the davos process - not to use their power, but to give them a chance to show their responsibility. and in business, when you look at people like john browne, group chief executive of british petroleum, or forum councilmember bertrand collomb, ceo of lafarge in france, or people like john bryan of sara lee in the states - they are aware today that they are politicians as well as businesspeople. and they really must look for ways to counterbalance their new political responsibilities with the fact that they have to remain competitive.can you give a practical example?mary robinson - the un high commissioner for human rights - and i talked recently about issues of corporate governance in a global world. we reflected that 10 years ago, the big challenge was to integrate the notion of environmental responsibility into corporate governance. today, although there are still environmental sinners, there is a basic awareness of responsibility. now, the same thing has to happen in the field of human rights - people have to learn to integrate the notion of human rights into corporate governance. and i would argue that if you asked 100 of our business members today, \"is this necessary?\" probably 70 would say yes.so the wef's role is to put these longtime issues on the table, along with new ones that are just now unfolding.yes, and to try to deal with all these issues without immediately emotionalizing them. of course, if you want to make progress, you first have to identify the most open - i want to avoid the word progressive - business leaders.you can't put too many hot issues on the corporate table at once, can you?but you have to have a certain courage. normally a business organization would go into such a discussion having already formed an opinion, which then often creates a situation where a conservative point of view and a resistance to change get emphasized.it seems to me that implicit in the whole davos concept is the notion that the wolf can lie down with the lamb - that business, the media, governments, and ngos can, at least, find some reasonable common ground for discussion.you've described exactly the most basic thing about our philosophy. recently, one of our foundation board members said he thought we had to define our beliefs much better. and we said, \"no, we don't need to, because our belief is very simple: we want to improve the state of the world.\" how? first, by accepting that there are different cultures, ethnicities, lifestyles, but then by understanding that in the end we are living in a global, interdependent world. so our contribution to improving the state of the world is to facilitate a dialogue among these constituent parts.and who exactly should take part in this dialogue?we should invite all those who have respect for the opinions of others. so we should not invite saddam hussein.what does the davos org chart, as it were, look like?we are both a members' and a constituents' organization. a member or partner is a company that helps to maintain us financially. a constituent is a participant in one of the individual groups that we have set up - the global leaders for tomorrow, for example. then we also have forum fellows, a strong network of people from academia, media, the arts, and the sciences.but looking at your programs, it's clear that the business component dwarfs all the others.in terms of attendance and financial support, yes - if you take the 2,000 people at our annual meeting, businesspeople comprise about 1,000.how do you answer the criticism that davos is fundamentally a watering hole for the corporate elite - the place rich people go to rub shoulders with other rich people?we invite participants not because they are rich, but because they are playing an important role in shaping the new economy. davos participants are not jet-setters who go to sotheby's auctions and just have a lot of money. they are people who are accomplishing things.the high tech industry, and particularly leaders of american companies, seem to be on the rise at davos. it's been suggested that some others resent all the attention they get.many people still look at the internet the way they look at computers, as another kind of machine that can increase productivity. they don't realize they are confronting a revolution that will force them to rewrite all the rules of the game. and so the question for us becomes, how do you make sure that young entrepreneurs get integrated into the group so that large companies are challenged by the thinking of the people who are creating the business world of tomorrow?how do you track developments in high tech?i have a team that does nothing but monitor high tech companies to see who is the most innovative in rewriting business models.how do you select your business members?we say that they should be among the 1,000 foremost global companies. we cannot accept more, because over this number we can no longer create a feeling of community. we look at revenues and capitalization, but we also tend to give priority to forward-oriented companies. so we accept amazon.com, e*trade, or ebay because they are trendsetters. those companies have all been to davos. but we have relatively few utilities or textile manufacturers among our members.what company is your most recent member?nike.it would certainly meet your criteria.yes, we looked at the company, but also at the person at the top - though that can be a double-edged sword. we want to have the company integrated with the top person, and not the top person integrated with the company. otherwise, if the top person should change, the company will be at risk.and you expel companies that no longer measure up?we have actively squeezed out a number of companies because we felt they didn't fulfill the criteria anymore. we asked about 30 companies last year and 30 companies this year to step down.and did they go willingly, or did they kick and scream?many have been very loyal over the years, so it's not an easy process. but they are leftovers from a time when we were much less able to be selective.do you do it personally?it ends up on me, and this is probably one of the hardest jobs i have. sometimes we make a compromise.you describe davos as a facilitator. has it also been an instigator?in the early '80s, when the world trade organization was not yet in existence, ambassador william e. brock - who was then the us trade representative - approached the world economic forum saying that he felt there should be a new trade round on the rather delicate issues of agriculture. so we got all the ministers related to trade together to have an initial discussion in lausanne, switzerland. the results were not too encouraging because there was strong resistance by some developing countries. still, we felt we should go ahead. so we invited the top ministers to a private two-day meeting with the secretary-general of gatt. even though there were many problems, we still went ahead and met again in the us. and out of that, the uruguay round was formed when trade ministers finally got together in montevideo.you must take pride in these breakthroughs.yes, of course! the wto was one of the outcomes of the uruguay round. now, when i pass by the wto headquarters in geneva, sometimes i have this nice feeling that we had something to do with the creation of this institution.at the same time, the wef appears to observe a kind of code of discretion.we had many discussions about whether we should publicize the fact that we were the point of origin - that we had started something to facilitate world trade talks and afterward the political machinery took it over. but my colleagues and i felt, no - what we did is exactly our role. and i am always hesitant to say davos was the first mover of anything. people often ask me, \"what role does davos play in corporate-merger discussions?\" a merger is like two people falling in love: it's a process. sometimes we are the place where the people first meet. sometimes we are the place where they do the proposing. and sometimes we just provide the beautiful sunset.and personally, what is the payoff for you in this work?i have the biggest luxury one can have. i can be a creator in a domain that has an impact on the world. i also have the satisfaction of working with a team that is committed to this mission. sometimes things do not go fast enough. you feel there's such a lot to do; you have problems. but i like it.wouldn't you also like to make a lot of money?i know that if i were to stop the forum or leave it, i would definitely be able to find a position where i could make more money. and at certain times i've had offers that confirmed this, though i'm not very interested.but nonetheless, you like knowing that the opportunity exists.yes, that i could do it if i wanted to. of course, if i wanted a fallback position, i have my tenured professorship. and i was very fortunate to join the board of a high tech company, nixdorf, in the '70s. that had a big influence on my whole relationship to new technology. nixdorf was europe's apple. it was the highflier of the '80s. and i joined just around the time it was going to go public. i'm also on the board of a private bank in zurich, where i have served for 20 years. let's just say that being part of these companies, even though i am not very involved, is profitable. although i never used my relations for my own uses, being on the boards has enabled me to have a more comfortable life.you're not interested in having yachts or houses around the world?i have one of the nicest - but not one of the most expensive - houses in geneva, and i have a chalet in the mountains. the rest i'm not interested in.running a nonprofit, you don't feel out of the action?i created a second foundation - called the foundation for social and economic development - in 1998 that is quite successful in the internet and technology fields. we have three participations. one is a videoconferencing company, advanced video communications, that we sold to us web/cks last year. we entered into this field after working on mediaconferencing at davos three years ago. afterward we began another small participation just to learn in a direct way from the internet world. so we created an auction site, industry to industry. lastly, we helped create a software company, think tools, which is a spinoff of the german government-funded max planck society.it sounds to me like you might actually yearn to be a businessman.no, i do it as a hobby. i'm not a social man - i usually come home from the office by 7 p.m., read the papers, have dinner with my wife, and then, from 9 p.m. to midnight, i do my phone calls to the states. that's when i work on industry to industry. and i hope that at the beginning of next year we can have an ipo. by the time of the second round, we will have a valuation of the company of about $70 million to $100 million, which is not bad for something that started half a year ago.and the profit would go into the foundation.yes.you aspire to have davos be a place where people can let their hair down. does that happen often?oh, yes. when prime minister yevgeny primakov was here last meeting - given his background, everyone expected a relatively cold, formal person. but at the big saturday-night soiree, we had a special russian room with russian music, and in he came and began singing into the microphone!and you preside over all these affairs - the formal and the informal?you can imagine how many times people go off after we have dinner or following an event to have a drink at the bar and so on. but i cannot remember one time when i stayed longer than 10 minutes. never.so for you it's a question of finding the proper degree of distance?in being social, i have always had two fears: the first was that i would lose my independence; the second was that i would lose time. i have practically no social life in geneva because i find it a waste of time. i have very few of what you would call real friends. i know a lot of people, but i always feel when i communicate with people and i convince people to do something, it should be done on the basis of the strength of the idea rather than because people find me nice or just want to do me a favor. however, i have very good relations with a lot of people. there is a small difference.have you never felt emotionally overcome by a davos \"moment\"?of course. there was the handshake between yasser arafat and shimon peres. and then there was the time nelson mandela turned to my wife and said, \"take care of this man, because without him the fate of south africa would have been different.\" well, his words left me with tears in my eyes. but the occasion that moved me most of all was in 1988, when the soviet union was still at the beginning of perestroika, and a russian dissident had just been freed from prison where he had really suffered. we caught him practically at the border and brought him to davos, and he made a speech so moving that i, and everyone else, had tears in our eyes. what he had to say about freedom was made all the more poignant by the recognition we all shared that finally things were really changing in russia.has your perception of greatness changed over 30 years of davos meetings?in the beginning, i was impressed by someone who had power. now, i am far more impressed by someone who has values. power comes from the outside, whereas deeply held values come from the inside.have you ever been disappointed by an attendee?we have had politicians, and even well-known businesspeople, give talks that have been prepared and written by someone else, and you get the sense they have not even read the speech before giving it. after all, you are invited to davos in a personal capacity, to share your own ideas, to be genuine. you should not recite someone else's speech.where do you think you and davos have failed?i think we've failed in one way that we're now in the process of fixing. the challenge has been, how - when you deal with all these issues - do you make sure that progress continues over the course of the year? in other words, how do we change the world economic forum from an event-oriented organization to one that can cumulatively build up knowledge? and how do we store the tremendous knowledge created during davos and inside the wef?why have we failed in this process of building up knowledge? because until now we did not have the tools. of course, you can capture words, but that does not create knowledge; it creates only data.in 1987, i made the first attempt to correct this. i said that the forum should become a process organization by using network technology. and we formed a joint venture with dec, because dec had developed its own internal-communication system. but we failed, because that system was developed mainly for engineers, and it was also too costly. three years ago, we had discussions with andy grove and concluded that the future would be isdn-based desktop mediaconferencing. so we invested substantially in this area, and i put together a staff to develop the concept and integrate the technology that we called welcom, the world electronic community, into our work. but once again, we failed. we were too early. multipronged desktop mediaconferencing still has not really broken through. and now you have such a fast move to broadband that isdn is practically outdated. i mean, in the states nobody installs isdn anymore. it's already out.wouldn't you also include the art of forming ongoing personal relationships as part of the \"knowledge\" that needs to be saved?the strength of relationships for the new generation will come from a combination of face-to-face and virtual communication. this is why the video component - or now the internet component - is so important. the new generation will not find it enough to meet at a place like davos if an ongoing meeting doesn't also happen virtually. there will be the expectation of a follow-up mechanism. this means, as i said before, that we have to build up a knowledge-and-interaction infrastructure inside the forum. we have made too many mistakes in the past on this, but we are learning, and we will not fail this time.what is the wef's current game plan?my vision of the forum two years hence is of an organization that meets regularly, but in the meantime you can communicate on the different issues in the form of a community-based knowledge hub - or you could call it a knowledge portal - into which we may want to integrate a video component later.the changes wrought by technology have begun to alter the trajectory of human life. what happens, for example, to the notion of retirement?this is one of the issues we are paying more attention to in davos. i think the whole notion of aging will have to change in the future. of course, there is a physical limit, and death is very much part of our lives. but you can remain creative for - well, my mother was 92 when she died, and she would have been able to tell you every german government member by name and at least five american cabinet members as well, which is probably more than the average citizen in the states could.you are 61. do you ever think about retirement?i know ceo colleagues my age, particularly in american companies, who retire. and i've discussed retirement with my foundation board. but i feel more like a politician. i have a mission. yes, i will have to relinquish much more on the operational side to make sure that i have good people coming up. but on the strategic side, i think i can still accomplish a lot, because i have even more credibility now and an even stronger network.what happens, in the 21st century, to the notion of generational divides?to cast the difference between old and young in physical terms is wrong. one member of our foundation board recently used the terms ac and bc: \"after computers\" and \"before computers.\" but it's not a line-zero mentality. there are 30-year-old bcs - some are my students, and i am still trying to reeducate them - while you find more and more people who are 70 and use the internet for hours. what matters is whether you keep your curiosity.is there an outer limit to your productivity?i'm a marathon runner, i ski marathons, and i do ice-skating marathons. i have created two tests for myself. one is in st. moritz, where i do the famous engedine marathon. and the other is that each year i have to climb at least one mountain that is higher than 4,000 meters. so i have a summer benchmark and a winter benchmark. i told my board that i would stay as long as i'm passing my tests.how much bigger can the davos phenomenon grow - especially in light of a new virtual component?if you look at the world of the past and the world of tomorrow, i would say davos is a kind of commune of the global world. communes are very open and transparent. the world in general will move back more to this notion of communes as we had them in olden times. the difference will be that the notion of the state will be strongly supplemented by a sense of belonging to a multitude of other carefully selected communities, through which you will create your identity.which will be more global in nature?which can be global or local. you may belong to the local rotary club and at the same time belong to the global davos club.what else do you dream of doing?i have three dreams. the first is more or less public, and i have discussed it with kofi annan. the nobel prizes were created at the beginning of the 20th century around those fields that really influenced the century: physics, chemistry, medicine - the hard sciences - and then, of course, there is literature, the peace prize, and the economics prize. i would like to build a kind of nobel prize for the 21st century that would honor social entrepreneurship. i'm thinking that there could be three domains for such a prize: sustainable development, which means the environment; human development, or what you could call education; and social development. but unlike the nobel prizes, the money would not be used personally - it would go to the cause or organization for which the prize was awarded.so it wouldn't necessarily be awarded to an individual?no, it could go to an individual or an organization - or it could go to a government, which is something very unusual.and your second idea?to create something i call transition to peace. the idea is that the international system fails in places like bosnia and kosovo when it comes to the peace process. yes, the international community puts effort into maintaining order and rebuilding civil society. but what you really need in such a situation is to create something like what europe created after world war ii. it's a very complex situation, but we have started to invite 15 to 25 people from each of four areas - south africa, northern ireland, bosnia, and the middle east - for an exchange of experiences in davos. we've had several meetings, and they've formed small task forces. we will bring them together again in the autumn. we have also established a web site where we list projects (www.weforum.org/ttp). i'm not yet satisfied, because i cannot put the necessary financial means into it, but i'm hoping to build transition to peace into a movement and an organization. what i'm interested in is not the whole process of peacemaking, but that of peace building.and the third dream?creating a center for the global agenda, a kind of think tank - a hub, really - to undertake activities on crucial global challenges. we would work with everyone in the world who wanted to contribute to such an effort.this sounds like a perfect next job for bill clinton. have you ever spoken to him about joining forces?well, let me just say that within this framework, our idea is to create some senior-fellow positions that could be in residence or not. i could imagine that such positions might be of interest to former heads of state.you're an ambitious man.my wife would say i'm a reckless man."}
