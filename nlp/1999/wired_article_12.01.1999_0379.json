the beauty of this scheme was that it would do an end run around the local phone companies and fcc regulations. best of all, so far as rouhana could tell, no one else had come up with his idea.in a state of excitement, rouhana called george the next day and offered to buy the frequencies for $4 million in cash, plus $6 million in winstar stock. he also insisted that the slightly stunned george join the new venture.there were some formalities. rouhana had to ensure that new technology really could make the frequencies work in bad weather. a contract had to be drawn up. weeks passed. when the agreement was ready for signatures in february 1994, it was almost too late.\"the day we were closing was one of the worst snowstorms ever,\" rouhana remembers. \"everything in new york was being shut down, including all the airports. and then the fax machine started humming, as people started trying to outbid me. word had gotten out. there were counterproposals! i was very upset. leo and i had experienced an instant bond; we'd both been at georgetown law, and both happened to be part lebanese. thank god the snow was there - it kept him in my office long enough to close the deal.\"six years later, rouhana is that rare creature, a contrarian outsider who outsmarted the experts and is now outrunning them. today his concept, known as lmds, for local multipoint distribution service, is a leader in the new category of fixed wireless broadband. (though lmds technically refers to a narrower band of spectrum, the term is broadly used in the industry to describe bandwidth above 20 ghz.) winstar companies has become winstar communications inc., owning spectrum licenses in 60 major us markets. so far, it has deployed wireless broadband in more than 30 of them.the package includes much more than just a pipe. winstar offers videoconferencing, lan interconnections, mpeg-2 video, distance learning, a proprietary email service, web hosting, online news, and a commerce site, office.com, in which cbs has acquired a one-third equity stake. winstar also boasts \"key broadband relationships\" with lexis-nexis, standard & poor's, and dun & bradstreet. if customers want to just surf the net, they can do that, too.continual growth seems assured, since the company has established a $2 billion strategic partnership with lucent technologies. \"with lucent we are working to make sure our network gets built out as rapidly as possible,\" says rouhana. \"on one level we are a customer and they are a supplier. on another level they are a financier and we are a borrower. on yet another level they are providing services around the world to accelerate our development. they also want to use our service, and have guaranteed $100 million in business.\"since signing its first client in december 1996, winstar has installed more than 500,000 lines serving 120,000 customers, many of them small to medium-sized businesses, but also a few big names like siemens and colgate-palmolive. ironically, the latter company uses the supposedly unreliable 38-ghz system as security backup for its regular plain old telephone service.internationally, winstar already offers service in the netherlands and in tokyo and osaka. it will launch a service in argentina, has a preferred allocation of radio spectrum in the uk, and is looking for grants in other countries.winstar is publicly traded (nasdaq: wcii), has more than 4,000 employees, and reports more than $300 million in annualized core revenues, $500 million cash in the bank, and a market capitalization of between $4 billion and $5 billion. in fall 1999 the company outgrew its park avenue headquarters and moved to a larger space a few blocks away, in addition to leasing 600,000 square feet in suburban virginia outside washington, dc.for winstar customers, a typical installation works like this: inside a multitenant building, a conventional ethernet cable links participating businesses with a single dish antenna on the roof. when a user sends data, its packets stream to the antenna, which squirts them out in a tight beam aimed at another building not far away. this second building is a hub that receives data simultaneously from many clients, sequences their packets, and pushes them out on a fiber backbone leased from a long distance company.conversely, data from the backbone is received at the hub, which sorts the packets and distributes them as transmissions aimed at the rooftop antennas on surrounding buildings. since audio signals can be digitized and sent as data packets, lmds carries telephone service simultaneously - which is no stretch, since the total bandwidth for each building winstar serves can be an amazing 4 billion bits per second, supporting up to 3,360 phone lines per channel, while users enjoy data speeds as high as 250 mbps (about 4,500 times the speed of a 56k modem).__ \"38 ghz is the functional equivalent of fiber, but cheaper and easier to install.\" __during the six years it took rouhana to develop and deploy his service, alternative technologies have made slow progress. as he predicted, fiber never became an option for most end users. annual growth in domestic fibered buildings fell from 65 percent in 1996 to 47 percent in 1997 to a miserable 9 percent in 1998, according to piper jaffray equity research. out of 750,000 commercial buildings in america, only 10,000 are served by fiber. virtually no residences are connected, and most probably never will be.dsl is being heavily promoted, with a theoretical maximum download speed of 7 mbps, although many consumers opt for cheaper variants such as pacific bell's 384-kbps service. but dsl squeezes its capacity out of ancient copper connections and is usually asymmetric, meaning that you send data more slowly than you can receive it. in chat rooms and newsgroups, many early adopters complain about outages and transfer rates far slower than advertised - as low as 120 kbps for downloads in some cases. if you live more than 3 miles from your nearest telephone exchange, you can't get dsl at all.nearly 1 million people now have cable modems, but many seem unable to attain the theoretical maximum download speed of 40 mbps. a recent computer shopper test run got only 600 kbps - a mere 1.5 percent of the maximum. urban cable users may suffer from rf interference that leads to dropped packets, while overall performance tends to degrade as more of your neighbors start sharing the cable node.lmds claims to be immune to all these problems. \"our system is 99.999 percent reliable,\" rouhana says of his fixed wireless product. \"the faa uses us in its air-traffic control network. this is rock solid, as good as anything you have seen from any other network provider.\"the word wireless has created much buzz, but lmds is unlike many other unwired systems. the antennas are highly directional, bolted into place; they do not support roaming. nor does lmds use satellites (such as the forthcoming globalstar). proteus, an airborne communications platform (see \"ethernet at 60,000 feet,\" wired 7.06, page 150), will be able to use the same radio spectrum as winstar, but it's not deployed yet.confusingly, in addition to lmds there is mmds (multichannel multipoint distribution service), which disperses its lower-bandwidth signal in a broadcast pattern instead of allocating a tight beam to each end user. currently, mmds (which, increasing the confusion, is often referred to as \"wireless cable\") is being tested for relatively high-speed consumer-oriented net access, which may explain why mci worldcom has been buying into companies - including sprint - that own the 2- to 3-ghz frequencies allocated for this kind of transmission. but because it's a system where all users share the same signal, it could suffer a performance penalty similar to cable modems when too many people compete for the limited bandwidth.despite the line-of-sight limitation of lmds, and its relatively short range, it's now the fastest bridge across the legendary \"last mile\" between installed fiber and the end user. consequently, rouhana's once-mocked technology finds itself locked in fierce competition.craig mccaw's nextlink started out as an early competitive local-exchange carrier (clec) offering independent local phone service. nextlink used its own fiber in some urban areas when it went online in 1996, but now it's going beyond wires. in a joint venture with nextel communications, it placed winning bids for lmds radio spectrum in a 1998 fcc auction. in january 1999, it paid $695 million for wnp communications, gaining rights to spectrum wnp owned. add it up and nextlink seems to have become the largest owner of lmds spectrum licenses in the united states. in september 1999, the company launched its first fixed-wireless broadband service for testing in los angeles.meanwhile, earlier in 1999 john malone, chair of the liberty media group (now owned by at&t), announced plans to buy the associated group inc., which just happened to be the largest shareholder in teligent, another major owner of spectrum licenses in the range suitable for lmds. this all-stock deal, valued at about $2.8 billion, will give malone 40 percent ownership of teligent and opened a new path for at&t into local phone service. in 1998 (its first year of operation), teligent's lmds service had penetrated 15 markets across america. the company aims to have 6,000 building licenses by the end of 1999, providing service in roughly half of them. as of june, it served 28 of the nation's largest metropolitan areas including new york, los angeles, chicago, boston, and philadelphia.like nextlink, teligent is staffed by telecom veterans. the chair and ceo is alex j. mandl, former president and coo of at&t. mandl's annual salary is estimated to be around $500,000, and he got $20 million worth of incentives when he signed. the company was well able to afford these perks, having raised an initial $1.7 billion - 10 percent of which came from japanese telecommunications giant ntt.kirby g. \"buddy\" pickle is teligent's president and chief operating officer. after holding various management positions at at&t, sprint, and mci, he was appointed president and ceo of uunet when it was bought by mfs communications. but, he says, \"i became frustrated with the inability of phone companies to provide my customers with high-speed access.\" all it took was one chat before he joined mandl.though teligent, says pickle, is committed to being \"service oriented, not content oriented,\" the company has announced that it will provide isp facilities some time next year. teligent's pricing is simple: the company averages your local phone and internet charges for the past couple of months, deducts 30 percent, and bills you the remainder at a flat rate. but winstar offers an even more seductive deal: $1,000 worth of free local calls for the first year of a three-year contract.net access via teligent is available at 384 kbps (to compete with cheap versions of dsl), or at 1.5 mbps (equivalent to a t1) or higher, depending on the pricing plan you choose. so far it's strictly for businesses, but that may change. \"i think within a year you will see teligent going to the consumer,\" says pickle. apartment buildings, not individual homes, will be the target, to spread the cost of the antenna and its transmitter-receiver across as many customers as possible.the smallest, newest entrant in fixed wireless is advanced radio telecom, based in bellevue, washington. art offers data services only; voice will come later. art chief exec henry hirsch was vice chair and ceo of williams communications group, which built a nationwide fiber-optic network that it sold to worldcom for $2.5 billion in 1995. in early 1997 hirsch quit his business involvements for a life of leisure - but couldn't resist the prospect of running art as an escape from what he refers to as \"my failed retirement.\"__ fixed wireless is now the fastest bridge across the legendary \"last mile.\" __when he took over the company later that year, it was trying to sell wireless links wholesale to clecs. this raw-bandwidth strategy was not working, according to hirsch. \"i cut the company in half,\" he says, \"then grew it back again as an isp, serving the end user. we halved the burn rate and started offering service in three cities.\"during 1998, art focused on raising capital. on june 1, 1999, the company announced a $251 million equity investment from a consortium including qwest ($90 million) and oak investment partners ($40 million). meanwhile, art was creating its own unique local-network topology. while other fixed-wireless companies use hubs that connect with clients via radio links like the spokes of a wheel, art is applying technology from triton network systems to connect buildings in san jose in a ring using 100baset ethernet. this consecutive-point architecture is meant to be more fault tolerant, like the internet itself - although this remains to be proven.\"this company has been very much in experimental mode,\" hirsch says. \"equipment was purchased by the previous management, and we used it in three cities. but now with new capital, things are going to change a lot.\"despite his prescience and his leading position in the field he created, bill rouhana still sometimes finds himself treated condescendingly by competitors.the digs often target winstar's media holdings, which include sports-radio talk shows, wellness videos, and \"art\" films but make up only a minor portion of overall revenues. \"he's a banker from the entertainment industry,\" comments one spokesperson from a rival company, who asks not to be named. \"what does he know about telecommunications?\"\"well, bernie ebbers was a gym teacher at my high school,\" rouhana responds, deadpan. \"it's true - he really was.\"more seriously, he goes on: \"sometimes i feel like seward, who bought alaska. people scorned him, just as they scorned me when i bought those spectrum licenses. people said, 'doesn't he know it won't work in the rain?' well, of course i had checked, and it works fine.\"\"what it comes down to is simply engineering for rain-fade,\" says international data corporation analyst jeannette noyes. rough translation: if you have more weather, you need more cells. \"the big issue is the perception that wireless is not as reliable as wireline.\"\"wireless is the best way to extend the network,\" responds rouhana, with alaska-size insistence, \"and the rest of the world has finally figured out what we knew.\"some silicon valley honchos seem to agree. during the ucla-sponsored 30th anniversary celebration of the internet in september 1999, panelist christine hemrick of cisco was asked which technology - dsl or cable - would be the key to bringing broadband into the home. her reply: wireless will be competitive with both - soon. earlier in the year, at the vortex99 conference, attended by ceos and ctos from many major telecom players, an audience poll placed wireless behind dsl - but ahead of cable - as the choice that \"holds the most promise.\"ultimately, rouhana believes his spectrum can reach more than 200 million people in the us. this raises tantalizing possibilities. lmds would be the ultimate video-on-demand distribution medium. with a large enough customer base, winstar could package its own content, rivaling hbo or cnn. does bill rouhana see himself as a 21st-century ted turner?he laughs at the thought. \"who knows?\" he says. \"my original vision, which is still my vision, was to integrate computer technology and information in a broadband network. does it include video? absolutely. movies? not in this round, but as we get further along and can offer services beyond the business market, we'll offer whatever the right services are.\"rouhana doubts winstar will go after the residential market for several years, but hints cautiously, \"i can imagine a way to get there earlier: let's say a cable company wanted to expand its addressable market. well, in the future we will have line-of-sight to thousands of multiple dwelling units - almost 10 percent of the country's residences. that would be very attractive to a cable company. i can imagine partnering with one that already has its own arrangements for consumer billing, customer service, and so on, so that we wouldn't have to do it all by ourselves.\"in the meantime, though, one seemingly trivial problem interferes with all of winstar's plans. \"our biggest impediment is access to buildings,\" says rouhana. \"eighty-five percent of us businesses are in multitenanted buildings. and it takes me 9 to 24 months to get access to one building.\"so, having built a multibillion-dollar business in competition with some of the nation's biggest telecom corporations, a visionary entrepreneur suddenly finds himself obstructed by that most elemental life-form: the landlord.the annoyance is compounded when you realize that other services are insulated from this problem by state and federal laws. \"utility companies, including phone companies, have legal right of access,\" rouhana points out. \"cable companies have widespread access. they can get in the building first and negotiate terms later.\"landlords hardly ever say no to an antenna on the roof; they just take many months to get used to the idea and to draw up the necessary documents. and rouhana needs to talk to 150,000 of them. \"this is going to delay broadband for another five years?\" rouhana complains, shaking his head in disbelief. \"it does not compute!\" winstar predicts it will have access to more than 8,000 buildings by the end of the year, but as rouhana puts it, \"i don't want to have to wait years to get to the rest of the landlords out there.\"in the meantime, rouhana plans to lobby for legislation to put him on an equal basis with phone companies, forcing landlords to open their doors - and their rooftops. \"i'm the ultimate capitalist,\" he says. \"i believe in private property. i want to work with landlords so they get appropriate protections. all i want is access to the roof and internal wiring to connect with it.\"so it seems fixed-wireless broadband won't entirely avoid the regulatory quagmire. on the other hand, wireless data is increasingly beaming into our daily lives, squeezed into countless on-the-go notebooks, pdas, and cell phones. more likely than not, it won't be long before renters demand broadband be part of the package with other workaday necessities like electricity and telephones. then rouhana may find the tables turned, as his antennas achieve another unprecedented breakthrough: taking up residence in midtown manhattan - rent-free."}
