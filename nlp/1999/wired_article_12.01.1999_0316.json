looking for naughty bits -- this webcam is clean. by andy patrizio.", "author": "andy patrizio", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "12.01.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "amid the numerous sexually oriented peepshow webcams is  aspiringactresses, a decidedly g-rated site that's built around two women's dreams, not their sex lives.it features karen and lisa (no last names please, at least not yet), two of the legions of struggling writers and actresses trying to make it in the competitive world of hollywood.it started when karen saw an ad in a local hollywood trade paper, offering would-be thespians a chance for a life akin to the popular american movies edtv and the truman show. turns out the two roommates had been thinking about something like a webcam for some time.\"it was a running joke that we should put cams in our apartment and tape things,\" said lisa. with friends and boyfriends coming in and out, their lives had almost a sitcom feel, she said.it took three months of discussing it between themselves and with craig winner, owner of lifecams. the beverly hills entrepreneur was looking for someone trying to make it big in hollywood, but wanted something more than a jiggle cam.as part of their contract with lifecams, lisa and karen can't cover or obscure the camera. the bathroom camera points at the vanity and mirror, not the shower or toilet, but the bedroom cameras have night vision, so the women can be seen in their sleep.if the women want privacy, they either have find a part of the apartment not covered by the camera, such as the kitchen or dining room, or go elsewhere, such as a boyfriend's home.\"you give up a lot of your privacy,\" said winner.the other lifecam sites are blatantly sexual. shannacam is in the home of adult film actress shanna mccullough, coupletv is a peek into the home of two minky college students, and abbytv focuses on a young woman with a number of tattoos who recently had a very sensitive piece of female anatomy pierced, right on the camera for all to see. not exactly the kind of content these screen actors guild members want to be associated with.\"some people said it would ruin our careers,\" said karen. \"in the end, it became a matter of i would regret not doing this.\"\"the biggest worry i had was that someone would take it the wrong way,\" said lisa. \"but as we keep doing it, we're not doing anything that could be taken the wrong way. so now we're using this as a medium to meet industry people.\"they needn't have worried. they've been contacted by agents, managers, casting directors, and karen got a small role in a film through the site. both women report they've had minimal problems and no harassment. occasionally someone at the supermarket will stare a little too long and hard, but that's been the extent of it, they say.\"from the email we get, the people who seem to stay are the people who are honestly interested in our lives and our careers,\" said karen. \"the kinds of emails we get are not the sexual emails. it's more like 'how did your audition go?'\"because the cameras don't record audio, both women keep the world informed of what's happening through online diaries. watchers have become rooting spectators, just like in edtv, cheering the two on as they go for auditions. viewers wrote in to console karen after she broke up with her boyfriend.the two are also inspiring other wannabes. \"a lot of the mail we get is from people who find what we're doing inspiring,\" said lisa. \"that's one of the best things, making friends all over the world and inspiring them and giving them encouragement.\"among their kindred spirits is david, a hollywood insider who declined to give his last name. he's a writer's assistant on a major network sitcom and was looking for information on webcams when he found the women's site. since then he's become a regular watcher. \"as someone who is the same boat as them, trying to make it in hollywood as a writer, they are fun to chat with,\" david said. the three have become a mutual support group. the women gave him advice on his webcam story idea, and he offered them advice.there is also a financial benefit. it costs us$15 per month to get a peek into the lives of lifecam participants. winner wouldn't reveal the number of subscribers to the site, but said the women are making enough to pursue acting full time.\"this web site has freed me up to be a student again,\" said lisa. \"acting is a full-time job, even when you're not acting.\" their lifecam check frees the pair up to mind the business of acting: attending classes, casting sessions, getting head-shot photos, and tending to other details.their friend david thinks the site is worth the money \"because they are really real. they aren't just taking their clothes off to make money,\" he said. \"i've found their personalities to be so easy going and they seem very well grounded, considering people are watching them all the time.\"even if they enjoy some success in hollywood, the two would like to stay online.\"i love having cameras everywhere and being online constantly,\" said lisa. \"even when i get to a point when i am a working professional, i would probably still keep doing this because it's fascinating for people. i will do it for as long as craig lets me.\""}
