forty-five years ago, french physicist maurice allais discovered that the swing of a pendulum will change during an eclipse, a phenomenon which has never been explained by established physics theory. advocates of autodynamics -- a theory that claims to debunk einstein's theory of special relativity -\ufffd believe they can explain the anomaly.\"einstein doesn't have a mechanism for [explaining] gravity, and most of the better physicists have said we don\ufffdt have a mechanism explaining it,\" said david de hilster, president of the society for the advancement of autodynamics. \"we can explain how it works.\"the autodynamics gravity theory goes like this: everything is constantly getting ever-so-slightly larger because of particles called pico-gravitons. the particles push things around causing gravity, and sometimes they get stuck inside objects, causing their mass -- and gravity -- to increase.according to einstein's theory of special relativity, mass and gravity do not increase over time.when the sun is screened out by the moon, it blocks lots of pico-gravitons, de hilster said, so it makes sense that a pendulum's swing would change slightly. \"we have a paper of brilliant calculations that explain why this happens and predict what should be measured.\"mainstream physicists have considered autodynamics a crackpot theory for decades, and most agree that an experiment at the stanford linear accelerator center in 1984 proved the theory wrong.\"as far as i was concerned autodynamics was disproved. special relativity is correct,\" said pierre noyes, professor in the theoretical physics section at slac, and lead researcher of the 1984 experiment.because einstein's theory is so pervasive in physics, and so much of their own research is based on his work, most physicists simply won't try to understand autodynamics, de hilster said.two nasa researchers will use a gravimeter at the marshall space flight center in huntsville, alabama, to revisit allais' 1954 and 1959 observations, which detected a 0.15 deviation in the rotational angle of the pendulum.the gravimeter itself will measure any gravitational anomalies and the researchers hope to coordinate their studies with a pendulum in europe, closer to the direct line of the eclipse.\"there's pretty good experimental evidence against the idea that gravity changes over time,\" said david noever, the nasa marshall space flight center physicist who will lead the eclipse research.noyes, of the stanford linear accelerator center, said the founder of autodynamics, ricardo carezani, has modified his original theory in an attempt to make the experiment work.the autodynamics equations, however, are exactly the same as they were 40 years ago, according to de hilster. the experiment was flawed, he said, not the theory.de hilster has been criticized because he has degrees in mathematics and linguistics rather than physics. but since he's studied autodynamics for the past five years and has worked closely with carezani, he said he understands it well.carezani was a student in argentina when he discovered autodynamics in 1940, where he claims his theory was suppressed by the peron government because it contested einstein's theory.now 77, carezani lives in california and still works to promote autodynamics.supporters of autodynamics do not subscribe to einstein's theory of the neutrino. the neutrino is integral to the theory of special relativity, which holds that the speed of light is constant. neutrinos are theorized to be particles with little or no mass or charge and an extremely weak force that allows them to pass through objects.conventional wisdom holds that neutrinos come from nuclear power plants and stars -\ufffd our sun produces over two hundred trillion trillion trillion neutrinos every second which pass through our bodies and the earth, according to neutrino researchers.autodynamics advocates believe that einstein followers fabricated the neutrino in order to explain inconsistencies in the theory of special relativity. and de hilster believes that evidence of neutrinos reported by government scientists is fabricated.it's the \"sentinel attack point for the theory of relativity,\" de hilster said. \"it has no mass and no charge and people have been trying to detect it and failed for 50 years.\"an inconsistency in the number of neutrinos shown in several solar neutrino experiments is a known problem in neutrino study.however, most physicists don't question the existence of neutrinos. huge and expensive underground neutrino detectors called super-kamiokandes, or super-ks, show apparent evidence of neutrinos.autodynamics advocates don't buy it. \"they hide the data because super-kamiokande collaboration is a secret society,\" an autodynamics paper states. \"they support the neutrino hypothesis in order to sustain special relativity, but with no scientific basis.\"but mainstream physicists say they've heard it all before.\"a lot of claims are made about \"relativity\" being wrong, in some way that has something to do with neutrinos,\" said lee smolin, physics professor at penn state university.\"there is no serious attempt [by the autodynamics supporters] to make an argument or to discuss the mountains of experimental data that refute their basic claims, for example, in which people every day produce and detect neutrinos in laboratories.\""}
