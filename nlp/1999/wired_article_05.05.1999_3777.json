reaches a minor milestone wednesday, with the first simultaneous online and theater premiere of a feature film. online film distribution company ifilm.net and business isp globix will present edward vilga's dead broke to audiences online and at new york's tribeca film center.vilga describes dead broke as \"a sort of hipster, agatha-christie comedy-mystery.\" the film follows a detective (john glover) as he investigates a murder that has taken place outside a collection agency (owned by paul sorvino's character). the cast also includes tony roberts and jill hennessy.beginning at 2 p.m. edt, visitors to ifilm.net will be able to view the 97-minute comedy-mystery using the windows media player.at the same time, the tribeca film center will download a high-quality digitized version of the film from the internet and show it using a hughes/jvc digital projector.\"distributing films over the internet for theaters allows us to practically eliminate the cost of distribution,\" said rodger raderman, founder and ceo of ifilm.net. \"this will open a whole lot of possibilities to get films out there that traditionally wouldn't get theater time.\"filmmakers and distributors agree that it's only a matter of time before digital production replaces celluloid. last october, wavelength releasing beamed the indie film the last broadcast via satellite to specially equipped theaters in five cities, making it the first digitally distributed theatrical film release.\"film is a nationally marketed product with a very conservatively controlled distribution. the hope is that electronic cinema will open the distribution channel up some, especially for independent theater owners,\" said wendy bosley, market development manager for electronic cinema applications at barco, a digital projector manufacturer.\"the technology is pretty much here ... so the remainder is just economical and political,\" said bosley, adding that the studios like the status quo.\"the studios want to make sure they keep the control they have now. while in the long run, the studios can definitely benefit from digital distribution, the independent theaters and producers are the ones who will likely have to push it from the beginning,\" she said. eastman kodak is not looking forward to the digital age, either. it produces the vast majority of the us$1.5 billion worth of film stock used each year for film prints, and stands to lose a lot when film is phased out. but the film giant isn't worried that dead broke will start a revolution.\"it's tough enough to change the technology without trying to change the system as well,\" said bob mayson, general manager of the cinema operations division of kodak.until digital projectors and storage media come down in price, mayson doesn't believe studios or theaters will push digital technology.\"one thing film has going for it is it's a standard,\" said mayson. \"who would pay $200,000 for a digital system that only one or two studios support, when they can get a $16,000 projector that works with every film, and lasts for life?\"others believe the transformation may come sooner.\"i think everybody has their feet in the blocks and is ready to run,\" said david baker, e-cinema development director for cyberstar, a company that hopes to provide satellite transmission services for digitally distributed films.\"people are basically waiting for the flag to drop.\"despite the cost of equipment, baker believes that smaller theaters and independent film distributors are already primed to go digital.george lucas' lucasfilm leads the charge to digital adaptation. in june, lucasfilm will offer digital screenings of star wars: episode i -- the phantom menace in four specially equipped theaters.lucas plans to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/news/news/culture/story/18495.html\">shoot the next star wars prequels digitally</a> -- hinting that he expects digital projection will be widely available by the time episode ii is released.lucasfilm's thx division, known for the thx digital surround-sound technology it introduced in 1983, recently announced certification specifications for thx electronic cinemas. the theaters will be equipped for fully digital feature film presentation.vilga hopes more people will see dead broke than would have if he'd hit the film festival circuit.\"there isn't a way i, as a filmmaker, could ever create the number of prints, and self-distribute them, in any way that compares to what's possible on the web,\" said vilga. \"it's ironic that the film is called dead broke, because we ourselves could hardly afford the digital transfer.\"perhaps even more ironic, however, is vilga's eventual goal. he hopes that his film will be picked up by a distribution company for theatrical release -- on film."}
