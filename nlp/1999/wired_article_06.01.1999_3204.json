(epic)the guitarist's guitarist returns for the first time in a decade, with a tight, muscular rhythm section and smokin' jazz-rock fusion. beck's new compositions range from lyrical ballads to furious, blistering rave-ups. the opener, \"what mama said,\" snaps your head around with its pummeling rhythms, funky bass, and dazzling guitar work; more than ever, beck elicits a kaleidoscopic range of sonorities from his instrument. and that's only the beginning ...the rentalsseven more minutes (maverick)imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, yet when american bands try to sound british, they often come off a bit ... well, flat. but on seven more minutes, the rentals' eagerly awaited sophomore album, the dudes do a nice job of just being blokes. singer/bassist matt sharp (formerly of weezer) takes the essence of britpop and creates his own unique tunes and formulas. songs like \"hello, hello\" and \"overlee\" contain sweet harmonies that surprisingly complement the jangly guitar riffs dominating most of the record. the result is a sound somewhere between oasis and jawbreaker. for added cred, a slew of britpop superstars, including damon albarn (blur) and donna matthews (elastica), contribute vocals. these lads are all right.fats wallera handful of keys (buddha)no matter how noisily today's acolytes - like the squirrel nut zippers - profess their discipleship, they can't hold a candle to fats. these 22 tracks amply demonstrate what made the man great: prodigious piano technique, a world-class sense of humor, and a sunny, rubbery bounce in everything he played. fourteen of these live recordings, from a 1938 nbc broadcast, haven't been heard since; the rest, cut at a manhattan nightclub the same year, have been available only on a hard-to-find lp. handful includes a generous portion of waller classics \u00e0 la \"ain't misbehavin',\" and fats's ad-lib witticisms and slap-happy banter are even more raucous than usual. long live the clown prince of jazz.blondieno exit (beyond)twenty years ago, blondie linked downtown punk hole-in-the-walls with uptown danceterias. after 16 years of dissolution, the band picks up where it left off, fusing resolutely loud guitars to ska, country, and rap - all with a decidedly '80s sensibility and suffused with chanteuse debbie harry's intelligent sensuality. though blondie's no longer rewriting the rules, its legend is secure, with this reunion a fitting bridge between then and now.street credbrother's keepercryptic adventureshave it your wayshout it outkiller opbatman's second lifereality checkrobo scopemusicjust outta betareadmepersonalized checkingdeep knowledge'phone of silencewatts for dinnerthe public face of linuxcontributors"}
