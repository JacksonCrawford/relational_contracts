(tommy boy)prince paul, the producer of chris rock's comedy albums, and partner dan \"the automator\" nakamura team up on this lighthearted project. silliness aside, what endures is the duo's sense of adventure as they create beats for hip hop luminaries (brand nubian, del tha funkee homosapien) as well as some unlikely folks (sean lennon, father guido sarducci).don byronromance with the unseen (blue note)after wowing fans and critics with dazzling excursions into klezmer, swing, funk, rap, and afro-caribbean music, jazz clarinetist don byron slips into a subtle, pastoral mode for this outing. with the help of guitar ace bill frisell and drummer jack dejohnette, byron explores the work of lennon-mccartney (\"i'll follow the sun\"), herbie hancock (\"one finger snap\"), and duke ellington (\"mural from two perspectives\") with elegant melancholy.frederica von stade/atlanta symphony orchestragustav mahler: symphony no. 4, songs of a wayfarer (telarc)known as the last of the great german romantics, mahler did his title proud. not only are his compositions exemplary of this adventurous genre, but the man himself was obviously smitten. songs of a wayfarer - sung expressively by diva von stade - is set to mahler's own german lyrics, absolutely maudlin with the stains of love. for symphony no. 4, he relies more on his prowess as a master of symphonic beauty. the 20-minute adagio is exquisite, quietly securing the appraisal that mahler's fourth is one of the most evocative symphonies ever written.mos defblack on both sides (rawkus)since mos def dropped his stellar first single, \"universal magnetic,\" in 1997, he has emerged as the ubiquitous poetic b-boy - from co-owning an african-american bookstore in brooklyn to appearing in a visa commercial and on nypd blue. last year's collaboration with fellow brooklynite talib kweli, black star, underlined the renaissance of conscious hip hop. his solo debut album carries on that tradition, fueled by urgent calls for change delivered with singsong lyricism. whether he's encouraging self-knowledge in \"fear not of man\" or attesting to the power of home in \"habitat,\" mos brings the voice of the underground to the masses.henri dikongu\u00e9wa (shanachie)those who equate the music of cameroon with the feverish, rhythmic buzz of makossa, zouk, and bikutsi will find dikongu\u00e9 a revelation. this guitarist, vocalist, and songwriter works a decidedly gentler groove. and while his sound is essentially west african, the influences of samba, salsa, and reggae are evident as well. cue up \"nama poula ndena\" and \"ndolo\" to experience the true breadth of the cameroon sound.street credrest in inner peacerip-and-roll highwaybiodetectivemagic markershead triphelping handelectric avenuereadmemusicpocket portalwords for windowsthe boy mechanicspin doctorsjust outta betathrash and burnthe long view on short-term profiteerscontributors"}
