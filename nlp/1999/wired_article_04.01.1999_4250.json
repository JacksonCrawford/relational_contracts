especially outstanding are john cale's \"hanky panky nohow\" and the powerful undertones on brian eno's \"spider and i.\"talvin singhok (island)talvin singh's first full-length solo album challenges the palate with a diverse 11-course offering that includes tastes of indian classical, drum and bass, pakistani folk, and electronica. a classically trained tabla player, singh wrote and arranged each song, uniting eastern and western instruments such as the shenai and the midi guitar; he recorded at studios all over the world. like a contestant on iron chef, singh whips up his feast with varied ingredients, unifying the effort with his tabla playing and digital massaging.joe passunforgettable (pablo)even air guitarists owe a serious debt to the late joe pass. nary a strummer exists who hasn't experienced near-nirvana listening to his recordings. pass played with small groups and large orchestras, but as a solo artist, he set the standard. throughout the 17 tracks of unforgettable, he is lead guitar, rhythm guitar, bass, and drums all rolled into one. his time is metronomic; his bursts of melody and harmony - although spontaneous - are strategic to perfection. like an amazing gypsy minstrel who ravished the goddess of jazz, joe pass had it all.ben leebreathing tornados (grand royal/capitol)aussie singer-songwriter ben lee was a musical sensation at 13, when he recorded with noise addict. now 20, lee continues - thrillingly - to match his early press and promise. from the pretty pop of \"cigarettes will kill you\" to the loungey rocker \"nighttime,\" this album's layers are alternately wounded, sexy, angst ridden, confident.various artistsafro american spirituals, work songs, and ballads: the library of congress archive of folk culture (rounder)recorded by john and alan lomax in the 1930s, this vital collection captures the palpable emotion of the time and makes obvious the influence these songs have had on subsequent generations of musicians. the spirituals range from the up-tempo \"blood-strained banders\" to the cool counterpoint \"lead me to the rock.\" the simple, raw work songs were recorded on prison farms; many feature ax-strike accompaniment that exudes the brutality of chain-gang life. a rich version of \"john henry,\" the archetypal american folk ballad, stands out in that genre.street credgeek basicslet 'er ripdata ports of calladdicted to toysthe art of getting alongblock-rockin' beatsamerica's cabinet of curiositiesmake more slimy gutsmusicjust outta betareadmereality bytesa world for the takinghigh on the hogvisual mixing in clublandmixed mediacontributors"}
