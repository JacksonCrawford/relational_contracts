perhaps, but analysts were downplaying any short-term advantage for microsoft's competitors.\"it could be a positive for companies rallying at this point, although the timeframe for injunctive relief could be years away,\" said morgan stanley software analyst chuck phillips. \"by that time, it may not matter in a lot of areas concerned.\"despite its legal problems, microsoft commands as much as 90 percent of the global market for personal computer operating systems. even short of a breakup, state and federal antitrust regulators could seek fundamental changes in the way microsoft does business, making a settlement improbable and setting the stage for an appeals process that could take years.\"i think buying a stock due to an initial outcome like this is a bit aggressive,\" added hambrecht & quist analyst christopher galvin. \"this could be a very long process.\"as for microsoft's stock value, analysts were debating how long it might be before the legal fog clears and the stock resumes trading on fundamentals following friday's federal court ruling.shares of the redmond, washington-based software maker, changed faster than a flashing pinball score, dropping as much as $8, or 8 percent, from their friday nasdaq close.after the market close friday, us district judge thomas penfield jackson issued his long-anticipated findings of fact in the government antitrust case against microsoft.\"i assume it will go down as much as 10 percent in a knee-jerk reaction to the legal decision,\" sg cowen analyst drew brosseau said. \"people will watch closely through the legal process. when we get a final decision in february or march, investors can begin to focus on fundamentals.\"the entire personal computer industry is gearing up for the company's introduction of windows 2000, the next generation of its business software operating system, which the company said last week would ship on 17 february, after several delays.michael kwatinetz, an analyst with credit suisse first boston, wrote in a note to clients that microsoft stock had much of the negative impact of a court decision already factored in to its stock price and he advocated buying the stock.\"at some time (monday), the risk associated with the case is likely to be maximally reflected in the stock. subsequently, the stock could trade with fundamentals,\" he said.\"we would be buyers later in the day, once the stock appears to have found its full doj discount level,\" kwatinetz said regarding the impact of the department of justice antitrust case. \"we wouldn't be surprised if microsoft weren't thinking the same way,\" he said, implying the company could become a buyer of its own shares at these lower levels.peter cardillo, director of research at westfalia investments, agreed that microsoft shares will likely become a buying opportunity today. \"if it dips into the low 70s, i'd be gobbling it up like nobody's business,\" he said.analysts emphasized that although the judge's findings of fact were a setback to microsoft that would likely set the tone for any final decision, the case was likely to drag on for years and end up before the supreme court on appeal.jackson is expected to rule in coming months on questions of law in the case and will decide on legal remedies.reuters contributed to this report."}
