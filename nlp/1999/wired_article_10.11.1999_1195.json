by joanna glasner.", "author": "joanna glasner", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "10.11.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "if money-losing companies are raking in billions in their ipos, it must be because of all their potential. it's common wisdom, after all, that shares of scrappy new companies do better in the long run than their more established competitors. right?dead wrong, actually.in fact, for the past several decades, statistics show that new stocks usually do much worse in the overall market, says ivo welch, a professor of finance at ucla who tracks the year-to-year performance of newly public companies.how much worse? here's welch's finding:\"in the long run, ipo shares have significantly underperformed to the tune of 30 to 50 percent below comparable companies over three to five years.\"that is not to say that new companies don't do well at first. in fact, most ipos have historically done rather well in first-day trading. it's over the long haul that they falter.that's not the only sobering fact that welch turns up in the ipo resource page, a web site that takes a somewhat unconventional approach to explaining how the market for initial public offerings really works.from questioning the accounting techniques that new companies use to pump up revenues to examining the behind-the-scenes plays that lead to first-day run-ups in stock price, welch takes a critical look at the machinations behind blockbuster ipos.in addition, he has a skeptical take on how much the average mom-and-pop investor stands to gain from buying stock in a company on its first day of trading \"unless you know somebody and you really trust them and you're going to get these shares for a company that you know is going to go up very cheaply, try and stay away from them.\"strong words.but among academics who've tracked the ipo market over the long term, welch isn't alone in his skepticism.\"the numbers i've seen indicate that it's pretty much a crap shoot buying on the first day,\" said jay ritter, a university of florida finance professor who tracks ipo data.welch says he first got into ipo research in a big way in the mid-1980s, back when the hottest new stocks were in the biotechnology industry. at the time, it was almost unheard of for a stock to double or triple in value on the first day of trading, like net stocks often do.\"internet ipos are a strange beast,\" welch said. \"when the internet ipo craze happened, of course all of us academics are scratching our heads. none of us understands where these valuations come from.\"why, for example, would a company like foundry networks, which went public in late september, price shares at us$25 a piece, if first-day investors were willing to pay upwards of $150? why not sell them for something closer to the market price?welch says ipo shares have historically gone up at least 5 percent or 10 percent in first day trading, mostly because the investment banks that take companies public like to under-price shares to attract big investors early on. but in the case of internet stocks, everything is about ten times more dramatic.the internet ipo boom has blown away a lot of traditional theories about how new issues should perform. welch is waiting to see whether internet stocks will live up to past trends and underperform the overall stock market.the early prediction is that some will. but a lot won't.\"these are very, very high valuations, and the fact that it's a very good company doesn't mean it's going to dominate the world in the next 20 or 30 years,\" welch said.trouble is, there aren't any internet companies that have been around for more than a few years. although bellwether internet stocks like yahoo, amazon.com, and ebay have blown away the rest of the market with their early growth spurts, it's unclear whether more recent newcomers will do the same.meanwhile, welch doesn't have a lot positive to say about the motives of investors who are hanging on to shares of newly public companies.\"why would anyone be willing to hold shares in companies that are risky and that can systematically barely beat the rate on safe treasury bonds? ultimately, the answer is related to irrational investor behavior.\" he writes.that and a bit of creative accounting that makes new issues look a little better than they actually are.a little known fact about ipos that welch likes to bring to light is the fact that companies have a lot of options in how they report their revenues.although companies can't lie about how much money they make overall, they don't have to be too precise in reporting when they made it. a company that earned $1,000 in a two year period, for example, could make it look like they earned a lot more in the second year, making it look like a good, fast-growing company.another popular tactic is to ignore profits in favor of revenue. that's because investors judge net companies more on how much business they do, and less on how much profit they make.welch's favorite example of the revenue game is priceline.com, the money-losing online travel site that at one point earlier this year had a market capitalization that surpassed america airlines, delta, and united combined. priceline had a lot of revenue, but it often sold tickets and other goods for less than it paid for them.one analogy would be that a company could accumulate a lot of nickels if it were willing to exchange them for dimes.of course, not everyone is quite so suspicious. ritter points out that dot com companies could actually be a lot more creative in their accounting.\"with the internet stocks, hardly any of them have positive earnings,\" ritter said. \"if they're trying to manipulate those numbers upward, they're not doing a very good job of it.\""}
