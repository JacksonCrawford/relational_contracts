licensing agreement allows mp3 encoding. hey us -- you listening? matt friedman reports from montreal.", "author": "matt friedman", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "11.18.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "montreal -- the days when mobile djs would turn up at parties and weddings with cartloads of cds are over in canada. with the announcement of a new licensing regime by canada's audio video licensing agency last week, djs are now free to spin mp3s from their computer hard drives. \"it's not like the old cassette days,\" says ottawa valley dj glenn miller.\"i can save everything i need in mp3 format on my hard drive, instead of having to carry around dozens of discs,\" miller said. \"and instead of searching though a dj book to find requested songs, i do a database search in milliseconds.\"miller has been something of an innovator -- and a criminal -- in canadian dj circles. he has been playing tracks from his laptop for some time now.with avla's announcement, however, he'll be able to work legally.\"this is something djs have been waiting for,\" said mike heindl, chairman of the canadian disc jockeys association. \"record companies are still living in the days of vinyl -- they don't want to even recognize the existence of mp3s. that's why this decision is so important.\"administered by the canadian recording industry association, avla has been licensing djs to make \"mechanical reproductions\" of music for their professional needs for 15 years.djs can buy a license giving them the right to burn their own compilation cds of \"useable tracks,\" instead of having to cart their whole cd collections around to their gigs.the license allows them to reproduce music as mp3s to be used at their gigs. it most assuredly does not cover downloads. the advantage, of course, is that a dj doesn't have to bring his whole cd collection to a show.the new licensing regime for mp3s is simply a recognition of technological advances, said cria president brian robertson.\"we've basically progressed from singles to tapes, to cds and cd-rs to computer hard drives,\" robertson said. \"mp3 is just the most efficient way of storing music, and a number of canadian djs had already moved to mp3s, albeit illegally. the simple fact is that we had to catch up to the way that djs are doing business today.\"for djs like miller and heindl, that \"simple fact\" is cause for some relief.under canadian law, a dj convicted of making unlicensed reproductions with any technology could face serious fines and the confiscation of his equipment. though there haven't been any such cases lately, heindl points out that canadian authorities have made examples of offenders in the past.\"we've tried to be on our best behavior, and this makes it easier,\" heindl said. \"djs in the united states are always saying how envious they are of us.\"there are no collective industry organizations in the united states such as avla, which is empowered to collect license fees and disburse them among record companies. consequently, american djs have no legal mechanical reproduction rights at all, never mind the right to make mp3s.representatives from the recording industry association of america, the labels' lobbying group in the united states, and from universal could not immediately be reached for comment.among djs, there is a bit of snobbery regarding which medium is preferred for mixing. some are wed to vinyl, some are trying cds, and some prefer the downloadable. not everyone agrees that mp3s sound good on speakers -- they are generally considered to be \"near-cd quality,\" which is not good enough for some of the golden-eared in the music community.but \"with mpeg-3 compression you can get a lot of music on a hard drive,\" said heindl. \"and unless you're wearing headphones and you have really crisp young ears, the sound quality is indistinguishable from cds.\"the cn$200 fee gives djs a blanket license to make one reproduction of music released by most of the major record companies. though djs have to purchase additional licenses for every hard drive they load with mp3s, heindl says it's still a great value.\"as business costs go, it's really minimal,\" he says. \"and fair is fair. money has to go back to the industry. they still have to service and develop new artists.\"although the record companies will welcome the license fees, the small amount of revenue they will generate isn't the point at all, robertson said.\"it's more a question of copyright control than generating revenues,\" he said. \"it's important to keep things like copyright above board like this.\"most of the major record companies have signed on to avla's licensing scheme, although universal music -- which owns polygram -- continues to hold out.avla has already established the new license fees in case universal joins the program, something miller said is inevitable.\"the fact that they've already set the fees for that shows that it's inevitable,\" he said. \"i can't imagine universal actually wants to be ignored by djs. they're just a little leery of new technologies.\"indeed, the bottom line is that, with djs moving to mp3 as their music format of choice, the music industry knows that its interests are best served by accepting the change.\"with radio stations playing oldies and sleepy-time music, where's new music going to be played?\" heindl asks. \"it has to be played at parties and events if people are going to hear it, and these days that means that it has to be available as mp3.\""}
