subversive postcards, annoy.com's founder resents mindspring filtering everything into the mulcher, as if it were common spam. by chris oakes.", "author": "chris oakes", "category": "security",

least, to say that we are spam, or to characterize [ email coming from our domain ] as spam,\" he said.fein is irked because he has been asking internet service provider mindspring to remove annoy.com, his free-speech advocacy site, from its blacklist of spammers. he said mindspring's list wrongly labels email sent from his domain as junk, and deletes it accordingly.\"to erroneously put us on a list of spammers and sully our reputation is inappropriate,\" he said. he published his grievance on his site thursday.mindspring said it is only following its customers' wishes.fein launched annoy.com in 1997 to promote free speech online in the aftermath of the communications decency act of 1996. a site feature flouts a provision of the act that bars \"indecent material with intent to annoy\" from the internet. the page, replete with ransom-note graphics, invites visitors to send their friends single emails containing sexual and politically subversive messages.fein recently lost an extended legal battle that went all the way to the supreme court, when the justices upheld the remaining strand of the cda that made it illegal to send annoying messages.mindspring maintains the list as part of its spaminator service \u2013 an option for customers choosing to block unwanted email. the company said it added annoy.com to the blocking list because customers wanted them to.\"at the request of our customers, we created a free spam filtering service so they could prevent unwanted email from reaching their mailboxes,\" said tom tatom, leader of mindspring's email abuse team. \"we add to that list based on customer reports and complaints.\"but fein insists the response is misplaced because mail originating from his service, while intentionally annoying, has nothing to do with spam.which brings up the question: what is spam, anyway?mindspring defines it as \"unsolicited email sent in mass quantities.... often spam email is for commercial purposes, advertising or direct marketing a specific product or service. spam email is often offensive and graphic in nature as well.\"fein doesn't think email from his service fits the description, especially since it is not sent in mass quantities and is not commercial. furthermore, the listing does harm to his service and his trademark.tatom disagrees.\"they are on that list as a result of being a known sender of unsolicited email.\"whether the isp has done annoy.com any harm depends in part on mindspring's definition of the domains in its list, and how the list is presented to the user, said electronic frontier foundation program director stanton mccandlish.\"mindspring could say 'we're putting sites on this list because we think they suck,'\" mccandlish said. \"and if annoy.com ended up on that list, they wouldn't have any recourse because that's an opinional matter.\"but domains on the spaminator list are quite objectively classified as spammers, he said, which could determine whether fein has a legitimate complaint, legal or otherwise.\"they're [annoy.com] labeled a bulk emailer when that's actually not the case.\"ray everett-church, attorney for the coalition against unsolicited commercial email, said it may be for mindspring's customers to decide whether mindspring is doing the right thing.everett-church is consulting to microsoft over an ongoing spam-blacklist lawsuit. blue mountain arts, an electronic greeting card company, sued the software maker for blocking the company's greeting cards from a microsoft email product.in that case, the judge granted blue mountain arts a preliminary injunction against microsoft preventing it from deploying the spam-filtering technology.\"that could lead other courts to find the same way,\" said everett-church. \"but ultimately it comes down to whether or not an isp has the right on behalf of users to filter messages for them. and if an isp user requests that sort of filtration ... they are really giving that control over what gets filtered to the isp.\"but fein insists mindspring has mislabeled his project and misrepresented what annoy.com stands for in the eyes of internet users and other isps.\"i find it ironic that they have a blue ribbon on their web site indicating they support free speech and yet they're blocking the domain of a company that fought the free speech amendment battle all the way to the supreme court.\"he didn't rule out legal action against the isp, though he said he hopes to resolve the issue amicably."}
