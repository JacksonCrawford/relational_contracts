german law still restricts its sale, though the term \"ban\" is somewhat problematical.\"if you go to a bookshop, the bookseller can have a look at you and decide if you are really interested, like if you are a student,\" explained arns christian, a justice ministry spokesman. \"it's not the book that's forbidden, it's selling it to everyone.\"if you sell it through the internet, you don't know who wants to buy the book, you give it to everybody, and that's forbidden. we can't do anything against the booksellers in the united states, because german law is only in germany, but what we can do is talk to everybody that has to do with the matter.\"minister of justice herta d\u00e4ubler-gmelin sent letters urging both amazon.com and barnesandnoble.com to refrain from shipping the book to germany. amazon.com banned such sales, and barnesandnoble.com asked for a complete list of restricted books.\"until they get this list, they said they can't do anything, and that's of course wrong,\" said christian. \"in germany it's not allowed to sell hate literature, literature of the nazis. they have to decide on their own. they don't need a list. of course there is no such list. newer books are i think more dangerous than mein kampf by hitler. we don't want to have this literature in everybody's hands. so it has to be forbidden.\"the latest controversy started when the simon wiesenthal center embarked on a high-level campaign to pressure internet sites like amazon.com and ebay not to unthinkingly promulgate materials that \"glorify nazism.\"this is important work, and it's easy to understand the center's rabbi abraham cooper traveling here this week to urge d\u00e4ubler-gmelin \"to keep ebay from selling nazi memorabilia in germany.\"among those available at the auction site is a cuff title from auschwitz, stitched with two stars of david, for us$300.\"is it really necessary for ebay to market a nuremberg rally flag and other items which glorify the horrors of nazi germany?\" cooper asked.that's an important question to raise, and it will be asked more and more as e-commerce knocks down international boundaries. but laws should not cloud basic questions of freedom of thought, and that is what has happened so far in the saga of mein kampf and the internet.make no mistake: the book remains of value. as one \"d m jongejan from haarlem, netherlands\" posted recently on amazon's mein kampf page: \"ignoring mein kampf is simply ignoring our past.... i am not defending fascism or hitler's ideas; this book may be filled with insanity, but it is written by probably the most influential man of this century. read it to understand his motives!\"that might not be bad advice. the devastation that wracked the former yugoslavia over the past decade shows that hitler's example is anything but dead, and that the same disbelief and laxity that made hitler's rise possible are still powerful forces. the importance of mein kampf is in how brazen an advertisement it was of just what hitler planned to do -- and later, once in power, did.amazon itself cites konrad heiden, author of der fuhrer: hitler's rise to power, who explains: \"for years, mein kampf stood as proof of the blindness and complacency of the world. in its pages hitler announced -- long before he came to power -- a program of blood and terror in a self-revelation of such overwhelming frankness that few had the courage to believe it.... that such a man could go so far toward realizing his ambitions -- that is a phenomenon the world will ponder for centuries to come.\"hitler was the one who believed in suppressing ideas. one of the earliest and most chilling indications of that were the infamous book burnings on 10 may 1933. could hitler have had such an easy time consolidating his power had the free dispersal of information not been suppressed?yes, there is something beyond chilling in reading posted reviews at amazon praising hitler's book for its scientific value, and urging people also to read david duke. but there is no easy way out of the conundrum of how to respond to such thinking. more knowledge, rather than less, must surely be employed in the struggle.amazon actually admitted it was not compelled by german law to get into the ugly business of banning a book. said spokesman bill curry: \"it is not legally definitely clear to us what the status of the english version is.\"but the modern rules of business and politics say that if a controversy kicks up, you always want to kill it, rather than giving too much thought to the issues involved. and at all costs, you want to avoid taking a potentially unpopular stand.that is what barnesandnoble.com has done. when amazon announced its ban on 17 november, the other online book dealer stuck by its decision not to ban the book unless given no other choice. \"our position on it hasn't changed,\" said company spokesman mary ellen keating.the german ban, actually entrusted to the state of bavaria, is just what should be studied, and discussed in public. in fact, not only has barnesandnoble.com shamed amazon.com with its stance, it may wind up prompting a discussion in germany of whether it makes sense to try to pretend mein kampf does not exist."}
