[the internet] is a very great tool and benefit to us in terms of our conducting surveillance.\"two of the 14 enforcement actions filed by the sec against 26 companies and individuals:the agency did not immediately provide details.lawrence artz, of roslyn, new york, bruce lynch of brookline, massachusetts, and two companies were accused of offering fraudulent notes to be used to build refabricated hospitals in turkey.the entire investment was a sham, the sec contends, adding that it filed its case before anyone gave money.artz's new york attorney, stanley moskowitz, declined comment.copyright"}
