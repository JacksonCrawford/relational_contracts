another is to wait for someone to create the essential piece -- a reusable, single-stage launch vehicle that can safely ferry 50-60 passengers to and from space.a us group, the x prize foundation, has offered $10 million to the first designer who can develop a ship that can carry passengers into space. sixteen blueprints have been submitted so far.right now the industry is eagerly placing its bets on lockheed martin's venturestar, a prototype space shuttle replacement that will cost more than $5 billion to develop.currently, the company is on the brink of testing the x-33, a half-scale prototype that, if successful, will clear the path for a fleet of launch vehicles that could be licensed to private space tourism companies within a few years.\"if venturestar and the x-33 happens, then it's probably by 2010 that public access to space is possible,\" said robert bigelow, president of bigelow aerospace, one of the few private investors in space tourism. \"the venturestar is probably the best hope.\"bigelow, the owner of the budget suites of america hotel chain and president of his own newly minted aerospace firm, wants to ultimately create a 100-passenger luxury translunar cruiseship that would permanently circle the moon, offering passengers weeklong vacations from earth.but there is always the question of funding. bigelow has invested $500 million of his own money in the project with the hope that other investors will eventually see the long-term payoffs, and follow suit.\"we're used to waiting a couple of years for a return,\" he said. \"we have to be flexible ... on the hope that we can be part of the encouragement process -- to move privatization forward.\"some nasa officials are relieved that bigelow has taken the lead in taking space development further, beyond the scope of nasa's capabilities. \"visionary investors like bigelow are essential whenever you're trying to get something fundamentally new started,\" said nasa's mankins.\"going places beyond earth orbit very cheaply is going to depend on a market that is substantially broader than the government,\" he added. \"in no way is nasa ever going to build hotels or resorts.\"but other organizations, like the architect firm of wimberly allison tong & goo, and the artemis project have designs of making scads of money, when the time is right, off the commercial development of the moon.artemis has already crafted elaborate plans for luxury hotels and resorts to be built on the moon, and a subsidiary company has already begun marketing space tourism books, magazines, and t-shirts.and the space island group is poised to construct the first commercial space station in earth's orbit, the christa mcauliffe station, when the technology is right.apparently among the developers of the moon's future tourism industry the concept of making money off the moon gives little ethical pause.\"there is nothing wrong with making money off of space,\" bigelow said. \"our whole history of shipping revolved around money. the pursuit of gold and silver drove the conquest of the western united states.\"but was space really meant to be commercialized? is there a lunar retirement community on the horizon?bigelow thinks space development might end up as a necessary measure to compensate for our follies on earth. \"there are some serious motivations to pursue space,\" he said. \"it may be crucial that we have access to alternative locations. space may not just be for fun but it could be for survival or resources.\""}
