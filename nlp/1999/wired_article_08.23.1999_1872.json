a dazzling array of new technologies are ready to roll. by joe nickell.", "author": "joe ashbrook nickell", "category": "science", "type": "article", "timestamp": "08.23.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "the new millennium is arriving at car dealerships this fall, with technological innovations that promise unprecedented comfort and safety. \"it's an interesting year,\" said don schroeder, senior technology editor for car and driver magazine. \"there's some wacky stuff out there.\"automotive industry analysts believe two new technologies in particular will have long-lasting ramifications: infrared night-vision capabilities in the 2000 cadillac deville, and hybrid gas-and-electric engines from honda and toyota.in december, honda will begin shipping its hybrid, dubbed the insight. with a base sticker price under us$20,000, the car will average 70 miles per gallon with no stops for recharging, said robert bienenfeld, advanced environmental vehicle marketing manager at honda.\"you need a certain size engine to achieve the performance people want. we've reduced the size of the engine ... while maintaining the performance of a larger engine,\" said bienenfeld.built around a 1.0 liter, three-cylinder engine made of aluminum, magnesium, and plastic -- honda claims it's the lightest car engine ever -- the insight adds power during acceleration via a dc-brushless motor that draws from a 144-volt nickel metal-hydride battery pack.the battery pack is recharged in transit by a generator that transforms braking friction into electrical power.c. van tune, editor in chief of motor trend magazine, sent a writer on a cross-country trip in a pre-production toyota prius, a competing hybrid car due on the market in early 2000.\"it runs like a normal car,\" said tune. \"a lot of people like the idea of their neighbor having a low-emissions, high-efficiency car, but don't want to make the sacrifices involved in using a fully electric car themselves.... this is the best near-term solution and one the average person can embrace.\"many believe that hybrid gas-and-electric cars have a better chance than fully electric cars at capturing drivers.\"electric is all but dead,\" said jacques dacosta, senior manager of product research at auto industry research firm jd power and associates. \"if the consumer can perceive that there's little disadvantage to hybrids, they could transform the marketplace quickly and appear in other models.\"other technologies appearing this fall will also change the way people drive -- and survive.cadillac leads the pack with new safety features, including a weight-sensitive seat cushion that determines whether and how to fire airbags on impact, and led tail lamps that illuminate faster -- promising an extra 15 feet of increased warning at 60 mph. the new features are standard equipment on 2000 model devilles.cadillac is also introducing a widely anticipated option on the new deville, called night vision. utilizing a grill-mounted infrared video camera and a real-time, upward-facing display that projects an image on the lower section of the windshield, night vision technology allows drivers to see as much as five times as far as normal headlamps.in addition, warm objects -- including deer and cars parked on the roadside -- appear brighter than cold objects such as street signs, providing added warning about potential hazards.\"you reference it just like you would a mirror,\" said mike albano, spokesman for gm's cadillac division. \"it doesn't get in the way of your field of vision.\"the option will cost between $1,200-1,500 on new devilles.\"that's a very significant new technology,\" said schroeder. \"you'll definitely see this as an option in the rest of the gm line over time.\"other safety-related technological innovations for the 2000 model year include the mercedes cl coupe's sophisticated active ride control system.using two dedicated computers and an array of sensors, the system instantaneously adjusts strut tension and spring in order to improve traction and comfort on bumpy roads and curves.ford will debut an unusual safety feature, called blocker beams, on its new excursion suvs.secondary bumpers, located below the primary bumper in the front and integrated into the trailer hitch in back, are designed to hit small or low-riding automobiles on their frame rails rather than in less structurally secure areas such as doors or windows -- thereby sharing more of the impact between the excursion and the smaller car.\"suvs have long been accused of being bad for safety of other drivers,\" said schroeder. \"ford is trying to quell this criticism without having to reduce the size or weight of this huge truck.\"climate-controlled seats in new lincoln navigator suvs use a thermo-electric chip, an internal fan, and tiny venting holes, to heat or cool each seat individually.toyota is making waves under the hood with a new variable-valve timing and lift system, which will boost the power of its celica gt-s from 140 to 180 horsepower without increased gas consumption or engine displacement.observers believe many of the new features will grow in popularity over coming years.\"a lot of these technological features kind of start in a niche of the market, usually at the luxury end,\" said dacosta. \"within a few years it'll start to trickle down.\""}
