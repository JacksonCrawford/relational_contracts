and why it's irresistible.__ email is a truth serum. that's why it's scary - and why it's irresistible. __every morning, i come to my computer, sit down, launch my email program. i'm an email pack rat, a compulsive saver and correspondent. i've kept every message - sent and received - since march 1994. my email folder contains 226 mbytes of mail. that's around 14,811,136 characters, or approximately 300,000 words, lodged in more than 75,000 messages. i save them because i can (i have an external drive connected to my pc for this sole purpose). my mail stays with me wherever i go, because endless possibility resides in the medium: an innocuous message might one day be exciting; an exciting message might become essential.joan feldman, president of computer forensics in seattle, and a colleague and competitor of jessen's, tells me i am on the outer edge of compulsion. \"maybe 15 percent of the online population keeps as much as you do,\" she says.from her office in seattle, feldman has a clear window on the collective psyche of the email nation, an exploding web of 96 million interconnected americans. where her forensic predecessors studied corpses, measuring time of death by the congealing of blood, feldman studies the particularities of electromagnetic fields on digital media, gleaning the patterns that form words. \"dig deeper. dig harder,\" she says with relish, describing her m.o. \"when people are looking at me and lying, that gives me an extra incentive to look further.\" and look she has.for more than 1,000 clients in six years, feldman has turned to email as an invaluable record of misdeeds, prevarication, plots, and sometimes tragedy. in hundreds of lawsuits, feldman has been called in to find hidden evidence, taking her to offices around the nation, people's homes, and vast warehouses where thousands of backup tapes containing millions of email messages are the digital equivalent of formaldehyde, a medium where nothing decays.meanwhile, the growth of email is relentless. in 1991, according to the electronic messaging association, an industry trade group that helps corporations establish email policies, 8 million americans had access to email. in 1997, the number grew to 67 million. now, 96 million americans use email. by next year, that number is expected to increase to 108 million, with office workers exchanging 25.2 billion messages daily. with nearly a third of the country sending messages to one another, hauls of electronic mail under subpoena have become more than a nuisance; they've exposed us all to the gnawing sense that anything we write may one day be held against us. it's led companies to want immunity from the human propensity to write what we think in electronic correspondence; a 1997 survey by the society for human resource management showed that 20 percent of us businesses reported they check employee email randomly.\"it's like insurance - people don't want to think about it until their house burns down. in the microsoft case, they saw their neighbor's house burn down,\" says feldman, who has seen demand for her preventive services - rules and procedures for systematically retaining or deleting company mail - increase by 50 percent over the last year.the cost of uncontainable email is most obvious in the workplace. daily, more revelations of email's truth-telling power are revealed; think of the new york times headline about the salt lake city olympics scandal: e-mail trail adds details to u.s.o.c.'s role. the story reprinted emails sent among officials of the united states olympic committee who were angling to bring the 2002 winter games to utah. an ethics panel dug up email describing, with casual nonchalance, the way votes were collected by granting favors to visiting representatives of the international olympic committee. referring to a quid pro quo in which sudanese votes were traded for airfare, room and board, and other amenities for their athletes, one official wrote simply: \"a lot of promises were made to secure votes.\"the technology of electronic communications is moving so quickly that it has outpaced both the law and our own sense of propriety. in a weird and still unclear turn, our vast pools of saved email have mutated into personal surveillance mechanisms. big brother isn't some dark figure of distant, central control. he's us: the decentralized record of all our thoughts and feelings, preserved in the electronic platters of hard disks on desktops and in archives across the country.for companies, email's permanence and seductive call to intimacy means facing a question: how can it be contained?federal law says that all email sent or received using a company's mail system is company property. the law, the electronic communications privacy act, dating from 1986, made perfect sense when email was still a novelty, confined mainly to large corporations with expensive, time-shared mainframes. but it makes little sense today.__ \"it's like insurance - people don't think about it until their house burns down. in the microsoft case, they saw their neighbor's house burn down.\" __in 1986, electronic mail moved through one of three types of networks. in the forefront were corporate email systems running off proprietary mainframes and terminals. companies like xerox interconnected thousands of employees within a vast local-area network. sending an electronic message from, say, xerox to general motors was impossible. the systems were closed off, separate. the internet was another type. though it was growing rapidly in the '80s - with several hundred thousand users, interconnecting universities, government agencies, and companies involved in federally funded research - it remained explicitly noncommercial until 1991, when restrictions were lifted and internet email started becoming a mass phenomenon. the third type was for general communications use. systems like compuserve, mci mail, and fidonet, which linked privately run bulletin board systems, also had thousands of users.in this world of separate computer networks, the ecpa allowed for an easy distinction between \"open\" and \"closed\" systems. the former provided email to paying customers; the latter gave people access to email as part of their employment. in a closed system, it is permissible for an employer, the system's owner, to treat all electronic mail like any other form of property, no different from printed letters. in an open system, messages are considered personal property, and private. but what happens when the once \"closed\" system of corporate email becomes connected to the \"open\" internet? in a strictly legal interpretation, the answer is: nothing changes. any email composed at work and sent to the internet emanates from a closed system, and is therefore company property.tora bikson, a researcher specializing in issues of access to electronic communications with the rand organization, says that the ecpa approach doesn't add up anymore. \"what do you mean by open or closed?\" she asks. \"there are no longer any closed systems, since with the internet you can connect almost every system with any system. the real question is, how much privacy do you want to trade for connectivity?\"complicating matters are services like hotmail - which give workers free web-based email accounts - and the increasing use of freelancers in the workplace.\"say a company has an email system, hires temporary employees, and gives them an email account because they'll be there for several months,\" says jessen. \"now you have nonemployees using the system. does that mean you've switched from being closed to open?\" jessen's solution is what he calls \"the consent rule - you put consent language in employee contracts that says by using the system you agree to have your email read by the company.\"that doesn't sound very appetizing, but employees have little recourse when it comes to keeping email private on the job. courts have consistently upheld the idea that constitutional rights to freedom of speech end when an employee arrives at the office. \"it's the employer's workplace, and he's master of his domain,\" explains jeremy gruber, an attorney with the american civil liberties union in new jersey. for the past two years, gruber has worked on the aclu's workplace rights project. every week, he receives six or seven calls from people upset about workplace monitoring of their email and internet use. typical cases involve workers exchanging personal messages disparaging the boss or their superiors. when the employer finds out, the underling can be fired.the workplace rights project supports legislation requiring employers to tell employees whether their electronic communications are being monitored. it's a modest ambition, yet in the current congress no legislation has been proposed. gruber's ideal scenario is one where \"employers would have no right to intrude on your internet use or email without just cause,\" but that possibility seems remote. for now, at least, the employer's concerns are getting more attention, and employers are frantic - justifiably - that problematic emails might cause them trouble.\"there isn't a single case i have that does not deal with email,\" says claude stern, an attorney with fenwick & west in palo alto, california. stern specializes in representing high tech companies, including symantec, intuit, electronic arts, and br\u00f8derbund. \"one hundred percent of my lawsuits now have a significant amount of time focused on emails and internet communications, like discussion boards and chat rooms.\" the first thing stern does in a lawsuit is request the other side's electronic mail. \"emails tend to contain very candid, and not particularly socially sensitive, remarks. we see it time and time again, making email the achilles' heel of every party in litigation.\"in 1998, for instance, several players of ultima online sued electronic arts, claiming the game was defective. stern succeeded in getting the case thrown out thanks partly to email he'd lassoed. \"one of these people had contacted customer support by email and admitted they loved the game. they said the real problem was not with the game, but with another player who had killed them and stolen all their stuff.\"in another case, a man filed a wrongful termination suit against one of stern's clients, claiming he'd been unfairly fired because of his age. stern obtained the plaintiff's computer and email, which he used to identify key witnesses and support the company's argument that the plaintiff was terminated based on performance. a california court threw out the suit.__ \"email is the achilles' heel of every party in litigation.\" __stern, trained to see email as a booby trap, sees potential trouble almost anywhere. for instance, he says companies that rely on email to communicate with customers are opening themselves up to whole new varieties of liability.\"one of the greatest vulnerabilities for companies is tech support and customer service,\" he explains. \"when customers are mad, they send in very frank email. the tech-support people tend to be very candid in their replies.\" thus, a company selling a defective product, while officially claiming the product works fine, might find its defense destroyed in email from an honest support employee. a canny attorney will eventually find those tech-support messages.\"we have a company where the tech-support person admitted the product had problems, that they knew it for six months, and wished someone would finally get around to fixing it. you would think they would want to filter that.\"newsrooms are especially vulnerable to the danger of frank email, since successful libel suits are based on the premise that a journalist knowingly produced a story that was false - that is, with malice going in. \"with respect to newspapers, email is going to be a very key part of libel cases,\" says james goodale, an attorney with debevoise & plimpton who has represented the new york times in libel cases. to win, the plaintiff has to show the journalist's state of mind while reporting the story. \"it's difficult for courts to decide what someone is thinking when they are looking at a story,\" says goodale. \"the chances of having someone say something out loud is very slim. the substitute for that will be email.\"the first high-profile libel cases based on email are just now taking shape. goodale expects email to play a key role in a suit by retired military officers against cnn. the news broadcaster aired a report on operation tailwind alleging that the us military used chemical weapons during the vietnam war, a story cnn later retracted.newspapers, like other big corporations, aren't adequately prepared. \"we don't really have an email policy,\" admits a senior executive for the new york times, who requested anonymity. the times policy is limited to controlling workplace atmospherics. in a recent internal memo, circulated by email to all times employees, the staff was told that sending \"messages with sexual implications, or which reflect offensively on another's age, race, sex, sexual orientation, national origin or disability, among other things\" would not be tolerated. even though the paper is sued for libel a dozen times a year, the exec says, \"most lawyers are not sophisticated enough to ask for email. i've never had to do a real comprehensive email search.\"we've just been lucky,\" he says. \"courts have no sympathy when you say, 'i have no way to search my system except by hand.'\"the subtext of you've got mail, nora ephron's recent movie, is that authenticity, stripped of the social conventions of everyday life, is revealed in the world of email. somehow the medium permits the characters in the movie to share truths about themselves, to reveal parts of themselves, that in the physical world would remain hidden. when we see the characters as antagonists in physical space, we squirm, knowing that they are meant to be with each other - that in fact they are electronic soulmates. and that if they are to become lovers, they must transcend the identities they've ascribed meaning to in the real world.when i emailed ephron (who's been online since 1995) asking her about email, she wrote back, explaining, \"what interests me about it - besides all the obvious things (it brings back letter-writing, et cetera) - is that it's a form of communication unlike any other and yet the second you start doing it you understand it.\" the conundrum of email is that it's a shortcut to self-expression, but it's also a language of its own. it invites both the mere passing of information and the sharing of secrets, longings, emotions. there's a certain permissiveness to it that real-world addresses on paper letters don't offer.one thing everyone gets right away is flirting. \"the main thing about email is that it's god's gift to the adulterer,\" a well-known writer tells me, adding, \"it is a little delicate, because i am in the middle of a divorce.\" the author is afraid that his wife's lawyers could go after his emails. \"the notion that everything you say on email can be subpoenaed ought to give pause to everybody,\" he says.__ email use is concentrated in personal computers, so personal stuff gets caught in the legal net. __he may be relieved to know that truth hunting can be expensive. \"we were involved with a case with 300 people and all their email going back four years,\" jessen says. \"it was a live email system with 16 backup tapes. the final email count was a couple million messages.\" that's relatively small, yet because the company was unprepared for electronic discovery, management had to hire 60 temps to sit at 60 workstations and pick through each message; relevant messages were forwarded to one of 20 attorneys. those were cataloged and delivered to the opposition, under court order. \"in nine months they had looked through not even a fraction of the live mail, let alone the backup tapes,\" jessen says. \"they had put in $700,000 at this point.\"jessen's solution was to copy all the mail to a central server and have an algorithm sort and search the email for keywords. he billed the company $200,000, pushing the total cost of making email available to the plaintiff to $900,000.jessen cites another case where the two sides had a combined email volume of 1 billion messages. each individual message had to be indexed and made available for either side in discovery. putting that document count in perspective, jessen says it dwarfs that of one of the largest litigations in us history - the justice department's 13-year antitrust suit against ibm - which involved 30 million documents.\"think about a company with a volume of 50 million emails a month,\" jessen says. \"it does not take very long to hit those astronomical numbers. so the bottom line is that it costs a heck of a lot to deal with email in litigation.\" this fact, he asserts, can lead companies to consider a settlement. \"if it costs less to settle, then you settle. a company that is not prepared is in an adverse settlement position.\"being prepared for electronic discovery requires a radical restructuring of the email mind-set. email use tends to be concentrated in personal computers - and personal computers invariably become perceived as \"belonging\" to an employee, even though the vast majority of messages may be stored on a central mail server. so companies under subpoena must retrieve files that contain all sorts of personal stuff that gets scooped up in the net, opening doors to potential embarrassment, or even more lawsuits, as new traces of malfeasance are discovered.the solution jessen and feldman embrace is a move toward further centralization. they believe employees should not be allowed to save mail on workplace pcs. messages would be saved on central servers and automatically deleted. (jessen recommends deleting after 90 days at most.) rules on what mail should be saved indefinitely would be defined by specific corporate \"retention policies.\"the electronic messaging association publishes a booklet, message retention toolkit, that outlines the basics of what it considers a sound email-retention policy. at its simplest, the ema recommends that companies identify all the different kinds of email employees write, identify how long various types of messages should be saved (say, seven years for tax-related emails, 50 years for certain sec-related mails, et cetera), and save them in a central archive. all other mail should be deleted quickly, the recommendations say, and employees should be given a thorough briefing on the retention rules. that way, when a company is sued, management can get to the relevant messages quickly and inexpensively.a retention policy can't do anything about calling back sent mail once it's left the company. and erased internal email may linger for a while as ghost fragments that can be reconstructed by the likes of feldman and jessen. when it comes to using email in lawsuits, \"deletion\" has a special meaning. it doesn't mean gone forever. it means, \"not our problem anymore.\" assuming that deleting mail is done as part of a long-standing set of rules - rather than in a last-minute, frantic all-night purge - retrieving deleted mail falls to the other side. the adversary has to hire the forensic specialists and convince the judge to allow a peek into the opponent's computers, something that's hard to do without just cause.the ema toolkit was written by a committee with representatives from a who's-who of corporate america: texaco, boeing, chevron, citigroup, and hewlett-packard. yet, when contacted, many of the booklet's authors refused to comment. \"it's just that the moment we hear the word 'litigation' we get very uncomfortable discussing email,\" says one of the toolkit's writers. \"it's just not a good idea.\"__ \"dealing with email retention goes into organizational issues and structures that may not even exist yet.\" __one contributor to the ema booklet, marion weiler, did agree to talk about it. responsible for crafting chevron's email-retention policy, weiler is in the midst of a $1 million review of how this 35,000-person corporation should handle email. \"we're creating a whole set of rules for how long email has to be saved,\" weiler says. \"there are entire classes of email we are required to keep, like taxes and contracts describing oil-field rights. dealing with email retention goes beyond deleting things that are not needed. it goes into organizational issues and structures that may not even exist yet.\"weiler estimates that chevron's new retention policy - storing mail in central archives and establishing clear rules about what mail should and should not be saved - will save the company 30 percent on related costs, including email retrieval, in future litigation, savings expected to exceed the cost of devising the policy. harder to quantify are the savings from avoiding catastrophic litigation and multimillion-dollar settlements. \"in the worst-case scenario, you find yourself in litigation that revolves around some electronic records, and because you can't find them, you lose the full judgment,\" weiler says. \"and if that judgment is high, it could be worse than dealing with y2k bugs in terms of cost.\"helping companies decide how to centralize email is itself now a booming trade. one popular approach is server-based programs that specifically allow for high levels of email filtering and saving based on centralized, company-controlled rules. a firm called worldtalk in santa clara, california, has seen sales of its email-retention software, worldsecure, increase 524 percent from 1997 to 1998. the company expects sales to double this year. \"in the last six months demand has really exploded,\" says company spokesperson dawn harris, attributing the boom to \"the monica lewinsky subpoena and the bill gates subpoena.\"worldtalk targets companies in the insurance, finance, health care, and legal industries. worldsecure generates 80 percent of the company's revenues. it can be configured to force messages emanating from senior executives to be encrypted. (encryption can prevent email impersonation and provide protection from snoopers; encrypted mail, under subpoena, must be decrypted and made available.) worldsecure can screen outbound mail for keywords like \"hot stock tip\" or \"insider trading.\" it can also screen for words the company decides are sexist or racist, halting the message's delivery. worldsecure can also be configured to limit who in the company can use email.\"to reduce risk, not everyone needs access to internet mail,\" harris explains. \"the people in the mail room do not need it.\" worldtalk's customers include 25 of the 100 largest us law firms, as well as nike, oppenheimerfunds, and catholic healthcare west, one of california's largest health care providers.in january, compaq released a product that competes with worldsecure. vault is designed to keep continuous email archives, seamlessly integrating new messages with old ones stored on backup media like cd-rom. using the altavista search engine, vault lets companies search their old mail by subject, keyword, and author, and has viewing capabilities to handle attachments in formats that, inevitably, will be obsolete in a few years. prices for vault and worldsecure vary, depending on the amount of mail to be stored or the number of users sending mail. vault, for instance, charges a onetime fee of $325 for the initial gigabyte of archived mail, with prices declining as the gigabytes increase. individual user licenses to access the stored mail cost $15 to $41, with discounts for increased usage. a hypothetical vault customer with 10,000 employees and 6 gbytes of mail daily might buy a license to store 20 terabytes, with the archive accessible to all company employees. the total cost: $185,000.but, jessen argues, there is only so much these programs, with their keyword searches and retention rules, can do to keep email under control.\"the single biggest impediment to companies cutting down their risk is culture,\" jessen explains. \"more than money or anything else, it's a cultural issue.\"__ \"more than money or anything else, the biggest impediment to cutting down email risk is culture.\" __email has a tone of intimate candor that's hard to imagine appearing in a secret business memo. it's a long-noted phenomenon, going as far back as the earliest studies of how electronic mail affects us. what's really eerie is how little our behavior has changed, even though email has been around for years. we still seem stuck in the same cycle of na\u00efvet\u00e9 and seduction, willing ourselves to believe that because email is electronic it is also somehow impermanent, equivalent to the temporary vibrations of air molecules when we speak.in 1985, robert anderson, an analyst at rand, cowrote (with norman shapiro) a seminal study on the social effects of email, called \"towards an ethics and etiquette for electronic mail.\" writing at a time when fewer than a million americans were exchanging messages, anderson described email's greatest \"phenomenon\" as its propensity to lead to \"misinterpretation.\" he warned of \"the strange permanence yet volatility of electronic messages,\" and issued cautionary statements that still sound applicable: \"never say anything ... you wouldn't want appearing, and attributed to you, in tomorrow morning's front-page headline in the new york times\"; \"assume that any message you send is permanent\"; \"avoid responding while emotional\"; and the very prescient \"consider alternative media.\"anderson, still at rand, is a bit dismayed at how few people followed his advice. \"so much for what i write! no one pays attention.\" he is particularly fascinated by email's mutation into a corporate problem. \"in 1985, we saw email largely as individual to individual. all of our cautions were about how an individual could be affected,\" he says. \"i have been taken by the microsoft case - how much of the day-to-day business of the company is done by email. thus the organization's history literally becomes only available through email. that puts companies in a dilemma. either they keep the mail, so it can all be discoverable and appear on the front page of the times the next day, or they scrub the files so nothing can be discovered in court, at the expense of their own corporate history.\"scrubbing the files, of course, does not ensure that intrepid computer specialists won't discover readable fragments, or that the recipient's copy won't reemerge one day from another computer system.what would anderson do about it? his proposed solution is rather quaint. \"i would have a rule that anyone who creates email with corporate interest print it out and put it in a folder,\" he says. the rest he would delete - at least the copies he still had access to.out of curiosity, i share anderson's idea with a microsoft employee who prefers to stay anonymous. \"ted\" is proud to tell me that his current email volume is a modest 200 messages a day - down from 900 last year - and he laughs at anderson's idea. \"call in the dump trucks! i got a lotta mail to print out!\" a microsoft program manager, he has been at the company for several years. he remembers the days before windows could handle email, when the entire company was networked through pcs running xenix, a version of unix. at every employee's desk was a diminutive terminal, generally a vt-52, with a monochrome screen and text-only interface.like most microsoft employees, ted now has two pcs: one for testing software, one for writing email and documents. part of his job is serving as a human email filter, relaying messages between the programmers developing a product and the marketers selling it. last year, he typically filtered 500 messages daily - \"we are tapping into the great collective mind of everybody.\"maybe it should come as no surprise that he's seen no impact, internally, on the way email is handled at microsoft because of the antitrust suit. \"i haven't noticed a chilling effect,\" he says. \"i do not pay much attention to the outcomes of what i write. when you look at the number of messages we exchange here, it's like a hallway conversation - in a medium that's stored.\"he says controlling microsoft email would be impossible. with thousands of \"alias\" lists - the equivalent of internal mailing lists - everyone's life is lived on email. when asked if he knows microsoft's official position on what's appropriate use of email, he says, \"i think it's in the handbook.\" has the company ever sent around a memo about the policy? no. \"it would be pretty funny if they did,\" he adds. \"everyone would comment on it.\" by email, naturally.__ stuck in a cycle of na\u00efvet\u00e9 and seduction, we keep trying to believe email is somehow impermanent. __"}
