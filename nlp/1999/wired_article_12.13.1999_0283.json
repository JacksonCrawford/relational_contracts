people think america's superspy agency has gotten too big for its britches. declan mccullagh reports from washington.", "author": "declan mccullagh", "category": "security", "type": "article", "timestamp": "12.13.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "it's enough to spook any spy. congress plans to hold hearings next year that will, for the first time in a quarter century, investigate whether the national security agency is too zealous for our own good. much has changed since those hearings in 1975. instead of being a place so secretive that the department of justice once abandoned a key prosecution rather than reveal the national security agency's existence in court, \"the fort\" has become enmeshed in popular culture.techno-thrillers like enemy of the state,  and even cut-rate tv series like upn's 7 days regularly depict nsa officials -- to their chagrin -- as eavesdrop-happy nixonites.but one thing has remained the same. the agency is barred from spying inside the united states and is supposed to snoop only on international communications. through a system reportedly named echelon, it distributes reports on its findings to the us government and its foreign allies.do those findings include intercepted email messages and faxes sent by americans to americans? maybe, and that's what's causing all the fuss.news articles on echelon have captured the zeitgeist of the moment, spurred along by pr stunts like \"jam echelon\" day. newsweek reported this week that the nsa is going to \"help the fbi track terrorists and criminals in the united states.\" (the agency denied it.) a 6 december new yorker article also wondered about the future of fort george meade.that future could look a lot like the past: congressional action that, in the end, doesn't amount to much. for this article, wired news reviewed the original documents and transcripts from the church committee hearings that took place in the watergate-emboldened senate in 1975. the select committee to study governmental operations with respect to intelligence activities published its final report in april 1976.it wasn't an easy process. nsa defenders tried their best to kick the public out of the hearing room and hold the sessions behind closed doors.\"i believe the release of communications intelligence information can cause harm to the national security,\" complained senator barry goldwater, a republican who voted against disclosing information on illicit nsa surveillance procedures and refused to sign the final report.\"the public's right to know must be responsibly weighed against the impact of release on the public's right to be secure.... disclosures could severely cripple or even destroy the vital capabilities of this indispensible safeguard to our nation's security,\" said another senator.but democratic senator frank church and his allies on the committee prevailed, and disclosed enough information to give any americans the privacy jitters. among the findings:shamrock: in 1945, the nsa's predecessor coerced western union, rca, and itt communications to turn over telegraph traffic to the feds. the project was codenamed shamrock. \"cooperation may be expected for the complete intercept coverage of this material,\" an internal agency memo said.james earl ray: when the feds wanted to find the suspect in the martin luther king jr. assassination, they turned to the nsa. frank raven, chief of the g group, received a direct order in may 1968 to place ray's name on the watch list. it turned up nothing and ray was eventually nabbed in london, raven said when interviewed for the book the puzzle palace. at another point the fbi demanded complete nsa surveillance of all quakers, in the mistaken belief that the group was shipping food to vietnam.huston plan: tom charles huston, an aide to h.r. haldeman, organized a meeting in june 1970 between nixon and his agency chiefs, including the fbi, cia, nsa, and defense intelligence agency. according to the nixon papers, the president wanted to collected intelligence about \"revolutionary activism.\" the presidential directive that came out of that meeting ordered the nsa to expand its surveillance and evaluate \"domestic intelligence.\"peace activists: at the pentagon's request, the nsa monitored the communications of '60s peace activists. the order came from the military unit responsible for quelling \"civil disturbances,\" which wanted to know if foreign agents were \"controlling or attempting to control or influence activities of us 'peace' groups and 'black power' orgs.\" an internal nsa memo creating the minaret project said it would focus on people involved in \"anti-war movements/demonstrations.\"drug war: civil libertarians like to say that any \"war\" results in eroded freedom, and they seem to have been right in this case. \"this is to express my desire to receive information produced by your agency which will assist the bndd to more effectively combat the illicit traffic in narcotics and dangerous drugs,\" wrote john ingersoll, head of the then-bureau of narcotics and dangerous drugs. the nsa complied. ingersoll's april 1970 request appears to have been prompted by president nixon's public declaration of the so-called war on drugs.the church committee eventually prepared an exhaustive -- and damning -- 396-page report that detailed how the nsa and other agencies had run amok for the previous few decades. one conclusion by the panel's chairman: congress has a \"particular obligation to examine the nsa, in light of its tremendous potential for abuse.... the danger lies in the ability of nsa to turn its awesome technology against domestic communications.\"but it's not clear how much has changed. some experts believe that not even top nsa officials know everything that happens at the agency, and it's a fair bet that the senate committee didn't get all the information it wanted.that might be happening again. widespread rumors that the nsa regularly engages in illegal surveillance of us citizens -- a rumor fueled by the echeleon buzz -- gained more credibility this year when the agency refused to turn over important information to congress.citing attorney-client privilege, the nsa declined to reveal information about its internal operating procedures.in an angry response, the house select committee on intelligence drafted a requirement forcing the nsa and the attorney general to prepare a report by the end of january. committee members expect \"a detailed analysis of the legal standards employed by elements of the intelligence community in conducting signals intelligence [electronic or radio communication] activities, including electronic surveillance.\"president clinton signed the measure as part of a spending bill, and the chairman of the house government reform committee pledged to hold hearings in 2000.since then, the nsa has managed to soothe hurt feelings on capitol hill, and the house intelligence committee seems to be trying to limit public scrutiny of the agency by other legislators.the intelligence committee, headed by representative porter goss (r-florida), \"may seek to either stall hearings before the government reform committee or dissuade intelligence community officials from testifying before it,\" according to a report in the 2 december issue of intelligence newsletter.not likely, replies a committee staffer. \"chairman [dan] burton has pledged to hold the hearings so there will be hearings. a date has not been set yet,\" said mark corallo, a spokesman for the government reform committee.corallo said the law does not allow nsa officials to ignore subpoenas from a non-intelligence committee.one legislator intent on seeing the hearings happen is representative bob barr (r-georgia), a prominent privacy advocate and former cia employee who earlier this year asked burton to schedule them.one hill source said the hearing is more likely to happen in the second half of the year.barr said he hopes the hearings will \"determine if changes need to be made to existing [law] to ensure that it fits modern technology.\"\"i don't know why anyone would object to hearings to determine if the nsa is operating within the bounds of us law. i would certainly hope not,\" barr said in an interview friday evening.\"oversight has to be a once-in-a-generation.... if congress doesn't exercise regular as well as periodic oversight, then agencies are going to get away with as much as they can,\" he said.as preparation, barr asked the congressional research service, part of the library of congress, to prepare a report on the authority of the nsa to intercept electronic communiations -- both inside and outside the country.the conclusion was, well, inconclusive.\"we have found no explicit statutory or executive order language giving the national security agency express authority to engage in interception of wire, oral, or electronic communiations,\" the 10 november report said. but the researchers said the foreign intelligence surveillance act (fisa) \"appears to anticipate\" electronic snooping.look for that uncertain justification for surveillance to be a big focus of the hearings -- assuming they occur.advocates haven't been quiet. the aclu and other groups recently launched echelonwatch.org to focus public attention on the nsa and echelon.\"the hearings are necessary so congress can determine whether the nsa is listening in on conversations that congress intended be private absent a court order,\" said greg nojeim, aclu legislative counsel. \"we also hope the hearings would expose any holes in the court order requirement of the fisa that need to be plugged.\"marc rotenberg, director of the electronic privacy information center, said he hopes for four things: \"public hearings, review, reform, and accountability.\""}
