i don't know.generally, operations on the web will be more and more going to third-party outsourcing -- storage network providers, advertising serving, image serving.content delivery is going to be more and more what you can buy off the shelf, and that means companies can concern themselves more with the \"what\" than the \"how.\"dr. michael witbrock, principal scientist, lycos: keyboards and wires will start to go away. keyboards have always been slow and awkward to use, but this isn't what will kill them. they will disappear because they are too big. the impending introduction of broadband wireless connections will give us telephone, videophone, and web connections where we need them, and we won't put up with getting them through something bigger than a palmv. in 1999 speech recognition became just good enough to use. next year it'll be much better. expect to see the initial appearance of interfaces based around mixed stylus and spoken input.software will become omnipresent, personal, and intelligent. with the web following us around, we'll expect all our data to come with it. network data storage and application access will gradually replace fixed workstations. and the data following us around will be more personalized -- instead of customizing our portals, spreadsheets, and pdas, we'll expect them to use machine learning to anticipate our needs and adapt themselves to our behaviors and environment. most importantly, they'll learn what not to show us. eventually they'll do it well.part of doing the job well requires software to become more intelligent. current web search engines, question answering systems, and shopping agents are grounded in past ai research. we won't get hal by 2001, but the first steps towards using more sophisticated conceptual, reasoning, and natural language processing technologies on the web will certainly be taken in the next year.jeff veen, director of interface, wired digital/lycos.com: you can't talk about the future of the web without talking about bandwidth. not a day goes by without someone making a projection on how many cable modems will be deployed or how wide dsl will spread in the next 12 months. \"how will that affect our web sites?\" worry the folks responsible for such things.my prediction remains as it always has: the fastest web sites, regardless of end-user bandwidth, will be the most successful.when i think of the things i do online -- manage my portfolio, buy plane tickets, use a search engine -- i'm looking for a page loading experience of under one second. period. it should be as fast as the applications i use on my desktop, regardless of branding, advertising, and interface.so there's a broadband challenge. yes, many million more folks will have access to high bandwidth. but your web site will need to be as fast as ever to compete.mary murphy, senior vice president/marketing, wired digital: 2000 will be the year of \"web brand shakeout.\" the din of web brands screaming to be noticed and tried is making it just about impossible for users to differentiate and care about any of them. brand choice is based more on inertia than real loyalty. the web brands that win this year will stand for something different, convey that difference simply and elegantly, and focus more on user experience than matching competitive functionality widget-for-widget.\"peter naylor, eastern advertising manager, lycos: it's an ad, ad, ad, ad, world.business to business on the web will continue to experience tremendous growth. fast company, industry standard, business 2.0, red herring, and wired magazine will continue to be fat with advertising as a result.many of those business-to-consumer sites that saturated the media at the end of 1999 will be eerily silent and many web dreams will be dashed by so much competition chasing such little mind share of consumers. as a result of this separation between the winners and losers, radio and television will see the whopping vc-funded ad budgets dry up just after the dot com, er, super bowl (40 percent of super bowl ads are dot coms this year).until christmas 2000, anyway.on the web, banner ads will live on in 2000 (as they should).george shirk, editor in chief, wired news, lycos news: in 2000, internet offerings will continue its peculiar bifurcation, with new york's silicon alley asserting itself as the content capital and the west coast remaining the capital of commerce and backend plumbing."}
