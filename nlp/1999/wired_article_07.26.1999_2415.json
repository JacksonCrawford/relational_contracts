recent weeks, the government has opened the business of registering internet addresses ending in .com, .net, and .org to new competitors, terminating network solutions' five-year lock on the lucrative market. but herndon, virginia-based network solutions has refused to allow other companies access to its full database of registered names, sometimes called the \"whois\" database.\"we strongly object to nsi's restrictive policy,\" commerce department general counsel andrew pincus said in a letter to the company dated 23 july and released monday.referring to the company's 1993 agreement with the government to register names, pincus said, \"nothing in the cooperative agreement, nor in existing law, gives nsi the right to restrict access to this information.\"a network solutions spokesman said the company continues to believe it was acting within its rights.\"nsi has various rights to information in the whois database, including use of a compilation of the information,\" the spokesman said.the issue is likely to be at the center of a congressional hearing wednesday in the house judiciary committee's intellectual property subcommittee.the commerce department's letter followed its criticism of network solutions in march, when the company first restricted access to information in the database.the two sides also clashed repeatedly over control of the database at a hearing of a house commerce committee subcommittee last week.james rutt, network solutions chief executive officer, asserted before lawmakers that his company owned the data and could not be required to share it.pincus countered at the hearing that the information was gathered under government authority and had to be made available to companies seeking to compete with network solutions.the government could ultimately hire another company to take control of the internet registration database if network solutions refuses to cooperate, pincus warned at the hearing.new companies competing with network solutions said they should be given access to the database of names registered in the period prior to the market opening up to competition.\"this was built under government contract and the data does not belong to network solutions,\" said rich forman, president of new york-based register.com.nsi critics welcomed the possibility of network solutions losing control of the whois database.\"it's the coolest thing since sliced bread,\" said networking consultant robert raisch. \"nsi has proven themselves to be more focused on their bottom line than on customer service.\"raisch frequently deals with domain-name administration issues and said he's seen many customers frustrated by nsi's changes to the whois database.the consultant said he warned fellow members of the internet engineering task force about the pitfalls of the cooperative agreement back in 1993, when network solutions originally took control of the database.he said the monopolistic power granted the company at the time led to the current predicament.\"the whois database was designed to be an expedient means of identifying the owner behind a domain name. nsi believes that info is of critical value to them because it is fundamentally their customer list.\"but raisch said the fact that it's a customer list is secondary to the fact that it was handed to them by the public.longtime domain expert and network administrator richard sexton said the commerce department is overreacting to a minority of vocal critics. network solutions' restrictions on the database were designed to ward off abusive domain speculators, not competitors, he said.\"the speculators are becoming much more sophisticated,\" sexton said. speculators use vulnerabilities in the whois database to reserve domain names without using proper procedures or making payment.sexton also warned of dire consequences if the database were transferred into another company's control. \"if you move it, it will break.\" failure of the domain name system would disable web browsers and prevent the delivery of email.consultant raisch expects the issue will ultimately be resolved in court.\"it was bound to explode and i think we're just seeing the beginnings of it. i think we're going to see an extremely long and protracted legal battle,\" raisch said.reuters contributed to this report."}
