realnetworks audit. is that good enough? declan mccullagh reports from cupertino, california.", "author": "declan mccullagh", "category": "security", "type": "article", "timestamp": "11.05.1999 03:00

source said. truste this week began to investigate realnetwork's practice of surreptitiously gathering data about the music listening habits of its users and recording that information.the inquiry comes as privacy activists have become increasingly shrill in their complaints about cupertino-based truste, which is an industry self-regulatory effort originally started by the electronic frontier foundation and commercenet. some advocacy groups, such as junkbusters and the electronic privacy information center, hope that the us federal government will regulate internet businesses instead.since its inception in 1996, truste has investigated hundreds of privacy violations -- some minor, some egregious -- by some of the largest online companies, including microsoft and deja.com, that have signed a contract to abide by certain data-collection standards. in return, companies may post a bright green \"truste\" logo on their web site.but so far, truste investigators have never revoked a company's ability to display that logo, which is designed to tell consumers that they can trust that firm.\"we have come very, very close,\" said spokesman dave steer.when reports surfaced that deja.com stealthily collected information about what links visitors to its web sites were clicking on, truste ruled that \"deja news' privacy statement clearly stated that it logged ip addresses and tracked user behavior.\"microsoft's practice of quietly compiling users' ethernet addresses was a bug, truste said after performing an audit. but even if it had been intentional, microsoft probably wouldn't have violated its truste license -- which only covers web site activities.this breach of privacy has since been corrected and did not at any time involve the microsoft.com web site,\" truste said.that web-only focus means that realnetworks' practice -- as reported in the new york times -- of extracting a personal serial number from the user's machines and forwarding it to realnetworks servers would not have violated its contract with truste.\"information that is collected on the internet outside the web site falls outside the bounds of the contracts,\" spokesman steer said.but he said that other language in the contract that encourages companies to abide by the spirit of the agreement might leave room to act.truste did not provide wired news with a copy of the realnetworks contract, but pointed to a generic one that all licensees sign. it covers just personal information \"collected through the site\" and says users must be given the opportunity to \"opt out\" of that data collection -- something realnetworks did not do.another clause in the contract says truste can rescind its license upon 30 business days \"prior written notice to licensee of a material breach of this agreement, unless the breach is corrected to truste's reasonable satisfaction within the 30 business-day period.\"that narrow focus on just web sites poses problems for truste, which is becoming both increasingly embattled and increasingly important as the united states negotiates trade issues over data collection practices with the european union. truste representatives have attended some of the talks.consumers may not realize that a company certified as perfectly trustworthy may still be recording information about them through non-web means, such as email or custom protocols -- and a public backlash could put truste out of business.the fledgling nonprofit, located in an office park on wolfe road in cupertino next to \"my mom's\" snack shop, seems to recognize just that.\"the most critical thing right now is the reputation of the seal,\" steer admits.another problem for truste is that its license arrangements -- companies pay from us$299 to $4,999 a year -- are not yet self-funding.so it has to depend on additional cash from corporate sponsors, which often are the companies that it's supposed to investigate. truste declined to disclose information about its budget.but it does publish its list of sponsors, which include microsoft and realnetworks -- currently under investigation. wired ventures, the parent company of wired news, is also a truste sponsor.truste, which employs some 18 people, including a two-person washington office, denies there are any conflicts of interest -- and even its most vocal critics have only raised suggestions, without pointing to any evidence.\"even if we had to yank one of our sponsor's seals, the program is going just fine,\" steer said.whether that's going to happen or not in the case of realnetworks is an open question, but steer said the process this week has included a lot of telephone calls with lawyers at wiley, rein, and fielding in washington, email to board members, and communications with realnetworks.if realnetwork's right to use the logo is yanked, truste also has to worry about being sued for libel or slander.for now, though, truste says it's still focused on helping companies get serious about privacy.\"if you screw up, we can help you make sure your privacy practices and privacy statement is in line with what consumers want,\" steer said."}
