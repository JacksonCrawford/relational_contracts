-- goldman then retracted the recommendation, saying that it was supposed to be released on monday.anyway, the cat's out of the bag, and goldman's analysts say that they like priceline because of its \"unique patented business method.\" market cap hates to rain on anyone's parade, but all money-losing priceline does is serve as a middleman for other industries. this approach is neither unique nor patented, and pretty much anyone else could come along and do it just as well, if not better. and without william shatner.3com (coms) vaulted 16 percent to $25.81 on continued rumors that the company is a takeover target. recently, the buzz was that intel (intc) was set to make a play for network-services firm. but now traders are wondering if the most likely suitor isn't ericsson (ericy), the swedish mobile-phone maker.pixar (pixr) advanced 50 cents to $42 after reporting a first-quarter income of 2 cents a share, even though a break-even performance had been anticipated. the computer-animation studio said that its bottom line had been boosted by royalties from a bug's life interactive products. the film has raked in more than $350 million worldwide.lastly, kellogg (k) finished a soggy 38 cents lower at $36.63 as it posted a 15-percent decline in quarterly earnings to 36 cents a share, which was still a penny better than expected. the world's biggest cereal maker said profits are slipping because it's spending more these days on product development.well, that's understandable. frosting or no frosting? with raisins or without raisins? the possibilities are virtually limitless."}
