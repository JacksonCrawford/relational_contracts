coordinating federal programs with local \"smart growth\" efforts in coastal communities; and expanding federal support for underwater exploration.an oceans report task force announced by the vice president will be co-chaired by the council on environmental quality and the national security council.the group, which will include high-level representatives of agencies with responsibility for ocean affairs, will set priorities for implementing key recommendations in the cabinet's report and will meet quarterly to review progress.\"last year's ocean conference launched an important national dialogue on the future of our oceans,\" the vice president said. \"with this report, the cabinet has elevated this dialogue to the next level, and set the stage for a truly comprehensive ocean policy for the 21st century. i commend the cabinet for its vital contribution, and i urge the task force to move swiftly on its recommendations.\"one recommendation that will be implemented immediately is a three-year $300,000 pilot program to enlist commercial fishermen in research efforts at the channel islands national marine sanctuary in california.participating fishermen will gather data to characterize and help protect the sanctuary. if the program is successful, it could be expanded to other marine sanctuaries.gore also called on congress to approve the administration's lands legacy initiative introduced at the 1998 ocean conference. the lands legacy initiative includes $183 million to protect ocean and coastal resources in fiscal year 2000, including $29 million for national marine sanctuaries, $25 million to acquire and protect critical fish habitat, and $10.3 million to protect and restore fragile coral reefs.\"today we take further action to protect our shores and preserve our precious oceans for our children and grandchildren,\" gore said.\"from small fishing villages on the new england coast to communities across america that rely on food from the sea, we are all linked to the oceans. we must protect them for our families and for our future.\""}
