nadar's celebrities are indelibly stamped by time and circumstances, personality and fate; his rich set of revelatory images add up to a complex portrait of the creative leaders of his society.meanwhile, warhol's images are potent as the product of an artistic ego, rather than a coherent aesthetic vision. how telling, then, that warhol admired paparazzo photographer ron gallella and recorded him, smiling, on the job.yet, just when it is tempting to dismiss warhol, or at least these shiny polaroids, we come across a single haunting image, a picture that defines its time and place. here, it is a double-portrait of graffiti artist keith haring and his lover juan dubose. caught in near embrace, their slender nude torsos childishly vulnerable, they are sweet and uncertain -- and, like so many warhol superstars, destined to die too young."}
