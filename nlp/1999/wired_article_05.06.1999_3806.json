will hard-core star wars enthusiasts be satisfied with the phantom menace? or was the preview campaign excessive? yes, yes, and no.viewers were bowled over by the computer-generated special effects. \"i'm convinced there's nothing they can't do now,\" one man said.\"the effects were totally impressive ... it's mind-boggling. i can't wait to see it again,\" said another.one woman could only utter, \"wow.\"was it a star wars classic? in some ways, it was just like 1977. as the audience spilled into the lobby, three kids spontaneously started to spar with imaginary light sabers.warning: the following page contains phantom menace plot spoilers. don't click if you don't want to know.the phantom menace opens on jedi master qui-gon jinn (liam neeson) and his apprentice, young obi-wan kenobi (ewan mcgregor). the chancellor of the republic has sent the pair to the planet naboo to negotiate a heated trade dispute. the evil senator (and soon-to-be emperor) palpatine is behind the strife and declares war on naboo until queen padme naberrie amidala (natalie portman) signs a treaty.the two jedis rescue the queen and a clumsy nabooian creature known as jar jar binks (ahmed best), but the troupe is stranded on the planet tatooine. they must find parts to repair their ship before organizing a counterattack.on tatooine, they meet 10-year-old anakin skywalker (jake lloyd), a.k.a. the young darth vader, and luke skywalker's father. anakin is a slave working in a junkyard/repair shop. almost immediately, qui-gon jinn notices the force within the boy and wins a bet with his owner to take him off the planet. qui-gon jinn later asks the jedi council permission to train anakin in the arts.the emperor sends a dark jedi, the deliciously malevolent darth maul, to find and return the queen and kill the two jedis. the rest of the movie involves preparing for the strike against the empire, and negotiating with chancellor valorum (terence stamp) of the industrial planet of coruscant, to help put an end to war on naboo.the story is perhaps the weakest aspect of the film, considering the unprecedented special effects and sound design.visually, tpm is everything you'd expect from a star wars film, with stunning cgi work, thanks to the geniuses at industrial light and magic. the costumes are gorgeous, the characters and locations are unique and memorable.the merchandising opportunities are endless and kids will definitely eat up the high-powered scenes, such as the blistering pod race, the three-way light saber duel, and the detailed landscapes of the planets naboo, tatooine, and coruscant.fans of the original trilogy will notice tpm has far fewer space combat scenes than episodes iv, v, and vi.jake lloyd did a fine job acting as little \"ani\" skywalker, delivering believable dialogue as a budding jedi. if you're going to criticize acting, you can start with the whiny mark hamill in episode iv.mcgregor and neeson gave impressive performances, and they played well off each other. lucas could've toned down the jar jar binks character a tad, though, as he was often annoying (what's up with that jamaican accent?). kids may like his catch phrases -- notably \"how rude\" and \"me thinks ...\" -- but his blather sometimes distracted from the rest of the dialogue.it's interesting to witness foreshadowing of episodes iv, v, and vi. for example, yoda is part of the jedi council, and when interviewing anakin, he senses his force is \"cloudy\" and full of \"fear.\"prior to running the two-hour, six-minute film -- 2:12 with credits -- a fox representative told one anxious theater crowd that the film was less than picture-perfect. but the color-correction issues and audio problems that have yet to be resolved were scarcely apparent onscreen.in fact, the sound effects and music are second to none. john williams' score features operatic sequences this time around.the downside: darth maul had too few scenes. anakin had a cheesy scene near the end in which he accidentally blew up a reactor to destroy the enemy ship in space. and the movie simply wasn't long enough. kids will love everything, though.any way you slice it, and if you're able to put the hype behind you, tpm is an enjoyable ride that should live up to its mammoth expectations.if you want to feel like an 8-year-old kid again and rediscover a silly ear-to-ear grin, see the phantom menace."}
