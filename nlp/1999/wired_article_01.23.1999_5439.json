(unless you stretch a point and count last year's case involving a vermont teenager who died in a parcel bombing -- the alleged victim of an indiana man he had reportedly swindled online.)in putting together the broadcast episode, the show's producers got a hold of some authorities in online wrongdoing: luke reiter and alex wellen, creators of and correspondents for zdtv's <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"externallink\",\"outgoingurl\":\"http://www.zdnet.com/zdtv/cybercrime/\"}' href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/zdtv/cybercrime/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cybercrime</a> show.a true duo -- both 28, both new yorkers, classmates at temple university law school in philadelphia, both fans of homicide -- they advised executive story editor sara charno on some of the technological and investigative realities her fictional detectives might encounter.\"the writers came to us for our creative input in terms of how to make a high-tech story line appealing to people, and they knew they wanted to have a murder that was part of a high-tech story line,\" reiter says. wellen adds, \"they would ask, 'can you do this?' 'does this make sense?' and we would come up with ideas and collaborate.\"before selling zdtv on their cybercrime idea, wellen was paying his junior-lawyer dues (70-hour-plus hours a week) at pennie & edmonds, a new york-based intellectual-property and antitrust firm.reiter was the kind of guy who might be turned into a character on one of the cop shows -- a young assistant district attorney in the new york city borough of queens who in two years handled about two dozen homicide prosecutions. that experience came into play when he consulted on the nbc show.\"one of the things that was interesting about this particular investigation [on homicide] is that you're dealing with very advanced technology generally in terms of what the story line involves, but you're also dealing with old-world baltimore homicide detectives who aren't really familiar with that technology,\" he said. \"so, maybe i was able to provide for sara, the writer, some sort of insight into how old-world detectives -- and i have had the privilege of helping my share -- might view a high-tech murder and how they might go about investigating it. some of the things they would know, some of the things they would instinctively elect to pursue first that they should or shouldn't.\"the result? dial up 12 february to see."}
