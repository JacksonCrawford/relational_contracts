with the company behind young investor, a site designed to teach kids about investing. the site gets its knuckles rapped for breaking its promises. by james glave.", "author": "james glave",

said broke its promises to protect privacy. \"this case is another example of the commission's effort to protect children online,\" said ftc chairman robert pitofsky in a statement on thursday.the commission settled with liberty financial companies, owner of the young investor site. the company said it built the site in 1996 to educate kids and parents about financial issues such as investing and the economy.young investor invited kids to detail their allowance and saving habits, and collected other personal data, such as their names and addresses. the company promised to keep anonymous the identity of children who volunteered their data to the site for contests and other offerings.but, among other charges, the commission alleges that young investor did not keep that information anonymous and \"maintained [it] in an identifiable manner.\"the company maintains that it has never violated any child's privacy.\"at no time did liberty financial ever violate children's privacy,\" said liberty financial spokesman hal thayer. \"we have never used any information gathered for our purposes, nor have we shared this information with any other entity.\"thayer said that the company included confidentiality in its definition of anonymity. \"at all times the information was kept both anonymous and confidential.\"\"we fully support the ftc's goals in protecting the privacy of children,\" said liberty financial spokesman hal thayer.but the government said that the words \"anonymous\" and \"confidential\" cannot be confused or used interchangeably\"we think that there is a difference between the two terms,\" said lee peeler, an associate director in the commission's division of advertising practices. \"it is a common-sense difference -- if you keep [the information] anonymous, you are not going to associate it with a consumer's name.\"\"the principle here is you have to live by the representations that you make.\"the consent agreement would order the company not to misrepresent its privacy statements in the future and would force it to post a privacy notice on its children's sites and secure parental consent before collecting personal data from kids.the company is not a member of truste or another privacy seal program, though thayer said he is investigating the idea. in the meantime, he said the site has stopped collecting any personal data.the company blamed the challenges of keeping a first-generation web site current in the rapidly changing environment of the internet.\"as new rules have emerged and new concepts have emerged, we have acted quickly and aggressively to address the emerging standards,\" he said. \"the action by the ftc is another effort on their part to establish and affirm those standards.\"\"[the liberty financial action] is a signal that the ftc intends to vigorously enforce its authority,\" said jason catlett, a data privacy consultant and ceo of junkbusters.last year, the government passed the children's online privacy protection act (coppa), which aimed to punish companies that violate privacy of children. on 20 april, the federal trade commission released rules that spell out how coppa would be enforced.under the proposed regulations, web sites must obtain parental consent before recording personal information about minors younger than 13 years old. catlett said that thursday's action, while rooted in the commission's existing authority, sent a clear message that coppa was coming.\"what this release is saying is they are still on the beat using that club to beat privacy invaders,\" he said. \"but in everybody's mind is the fact they are currently making the rules for coppa -- which will give them a much bigger new stick to beat them in other directions.\"\"it is a very nice trophy to put on the ftc's wall.\"last august, the ftc punished geocities for not protecting the privacy of kids who surrendered information in areas of that company's web site.aside from the alleged privacy violations, the commission also charged liberty financial with failing to ship prizes as promised in a contest running on its site. thayer said that all the prizes -- including computer scanners -- have since been delivered.the proposed agreement does not include any fines. rather, peeler said that it places the company under an order that will apply to the collection of information from children and young adults. should the company violate that order, it will be subject to substantial civil penalties, he said.the ftc will enter its proposed settlement with liberty financial into the federal register for a 60-day public comment period, then decide whether or not to make it final."}
