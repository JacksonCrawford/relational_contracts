[starbucks] created a science out of the double latt\u00e9 and the frappuccino.\" joe, too, has to face the forces of the market, quittner added.his point of view is echoed by mark leyner, an author and magazine writer who has contributed to esquire and the new yorker, among other publications.\"there's people that like to bitch all the time about the decline of culture, but it's so tedious,\" leyner said. \"the idea that there are any publications that are somehow completely pure and devoid of any contentiousness is naive. the people who are getting sanctimonious probably have too much time on their hands.\"\"people love trashing new mags,\" said coupland. \"it's like some kind of law. but i don't think [joe] merits a beating. it's also running fiction which most magazine editors out there [in new york] consider the kiss of death. so, good for them.\"while mowbray said starbucks isn't involved in the decision of what to print, there is something eerie about the bold \"trust me,\" printed on the premier cover of the magazine.\"for our customers, we strive to provide consistency, quality, and familiarity in an effort to gain their trust,\" said starbucks' johnson. \"they trust starbucks in terms of quality.\" but the magazine's choice of those words was \"a coincidence,\" johnson said.\"you can't demand trust; you have to earn it,\" johnson said. joe has yet to do either, but the audience, not the literati, will decide."}
