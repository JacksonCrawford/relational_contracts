(wired news declined the graft.)quiet period? like other companies about to go public, mp3.com took the sec-mandated pre-ipo quiet period to ridiculous extremes, based on lawyer-fed fear that the commission would postpone the offering if a company hypes its financial prospects to drive up its ipo price. mp3.com founder and ceo michael robertson probably had to whip out the 'quiet period' excuse every 10 minutes at his own summit, whenever anyone asked his opinion on any mp3.com subject.but the company was, well, remarkably available, on one count. its public relations teams saw to it that the \"groundbreaking\" announcement of the ascap live-performance licensing deal with mp3.com was rushed into media hands. still no comment, but lots of encouragement.best business plan of the summit: a lowly yellow cab driver, carting mp3ers to and fro among after-hours bars and restaurants: \"i don't understand why they don't hook this stuff up to jukeboxes.\" brilliant idea, his passengers thought: maybe a side project for digital on demand. imagine walking into any bar and cueing up any song, not just the cds or records in the jukebox. who needs the internet?hilary rosen's mp3.com account: mp3.com founder and ceo michael robertson demonstrated the new personalized site feature, my mp3.com. to the audience's glee, robertson took the liberty of \"registering\" the format's nemesis, hilary rosen, president and ceo of the recording industry association of america. robertson chose an account alias for rosen, too: \"mp3 forever.\"\"that's a nice nickname, huh?\" he taunted.related wired links:mp3 goes mainstream16.jun.99mp3 hardware: beyond the rio16.jun.99one-stop mp3 searching16.jun.99barlow: music wants to be free15.jun.99rio rolls over riaa15.jun.99"}
