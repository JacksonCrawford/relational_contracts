prices recover somewhat as individual investors go on a buying spree. by david lazarus.", "author": "david lazarus", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "01.13.1999 02:00 PM", "text": "wall street took another beating wednesday, but the damage wasn't nearly as severe as it could have been. a massive sell-off in the morning that resulted from the head of brazil's central bank quitting, and his successor effectively devaluing the currency, was replaced in the afternoon by aggressive bargain hunting, erasing much of the earlier losses. meanwhile, lucent technologies announced a us$20 billion buyout of ascend communications. the deal is intended to bolster lucent's data-networking capabilities, making it a more formidable rival to cisco systems.the dow jones industrial average ultimately shed 125.12 points to close at 9349.56 after being down more than 260 in the morning, and the s&p 500 was 5.11 lower at 1234.40. the nasdaq composite index ended 3.43 lower at 2317.32 after being down more than 100, and the wired index was down 11.35 at 605.43.the doings in brazil caught us traders off guard, and it's a sign of the market's shaky sentiment that the initial response, especially among the institutional big boys, was to unload stocks as fast as they could get their hands on their portfolios. but not everyone is convinced that brazil's woes merit full blame for the sell-off.\"it's just an excuse for the big professional investors to dump their stocks,\" said george koo, associate director of burnham securities. \"they got in early this morning and pounded the market. then we saw the individual investors come to the rescue.\"current valuations are scaring the hell out of institutional heavyweights, he added, and they were simply awaiting a convenient moment in which to retreat from many big-ticket holdings. this is especially true for once-mighty internet stocks, which are now in free-fall as traders realize there was nothing but wishful thinking holding up those ridiculously high share prices.credit all those online individual investors with recognizing a great buying opportunity and turning the market around. it's probably safe to say they prevented a moment's despair from snowballing into a full-blown disaster.yahoo (yhoo) is an excellent example of the uncertainty now overshadowing net outfits. although the company dazzled the street tuesday with better-than-expected quarterly profit of 21 cents a share, disappointment subsequently set in the amount wasn't even higher.analysts reflected the mixed reaction to yahoo's performance. while credit suisse first boston, goldman sachs, and wheat first union upheld high ratings for the company's stock, bt alex brown downgraded the portal to \"buy\" from \"strong buy.\" by the closing bell, yahoo was down $33.50 at $368.50 after earlier plunging as low as $332.still, koo thinks some caution is warranted. \"if individual investors see yahoo at $400 a share, and then it becomes $390 a share, they say, 'hey, it's cheap!',\" he observed. \"that's not the best way to value shares.\"at least it looks like a little common sense has taken root in how other net stocks are appraised. broadcast.com (bcst) remained on the descent, falling another $54.50, or 24 percent, to $168.50. amazon.com (amzn) slid $15.38 to $148, and ebay (ebay) was down $25, or 10 percent, at $215.50.america online (aol) slipped $7.75 to $145.88 even as it unveiled an accord with bell atlantic to offer high-speed net access via bell's lines. aol already has similar pacts with mci worldcom and gte. separately, software maker viagrafix (viax) soared $4, or 70 percent, to $9.75 after cutting a marketing deal with the world's biggest online service.software reseller beyond.com (bynd) dropped $6.44, or 17 percent, to $30.56 after posting a fourth-quarter loss of 53 cents a share. analysts had been looking for a setback of no more than 47 cents.traders were pleased that lucent (lu) and ascend (asnd) at last had tied the knot after more than a year of on-again, off-again courtship -- at least as far as ascend is concerned. ascend's stock gained $5.38 to $80.31 on word of its $20 billion sale price.but there was some concern about how the deal would affect lucent's bottom line, especially with the telecom-equipment maker also saying it will shell out about $49 million for a 12.2- percent stake in spanish telco amper sa. the spending spree drove lucent's stock down $3.38 to $104.50.intel (intc) was a hot pick after reporting an 18 percent hike in quarterly earnings, handily whipping analysts' expectations with profit of $1.19 a share. with prospects for the chip industry improving, intel rose $3.44 to $139.elsewhere in tech, dell computer (dell) slid $1.13 to $79.31, while ibm (ibm) was up 44 cents at $185.50. cisco systems (csco) fell $2.25 to $95.88, and microsoft (msft) was $1.63 higher at $143.81.lastly, a gentle reminder of the value of whispering \"e-commerce\" to investors. healthcare-info provider advanced health (advh) issued a statement saying it plans to focus its business on electronic commerce among doctors and hospitals. that was sufficient to propel the company's stock up $1.69, or 84 percent, to $3.69.they also said they were changing their name to aht. imagine how high the firm's shares would have flown if they'd added a .com to that."}
