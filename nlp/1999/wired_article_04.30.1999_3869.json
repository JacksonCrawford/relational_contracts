(\"i have a lot of things in common with holden.\") like the other cubans interviewed for this article, nick would risk serious trouble if he were identified by his real name. \"i have a european friend who is a reporter,\" nick said. \"she wrote an article about cuba today and sent it by email from the library here. two days later, the police came around to her apartment with a citation. they had a printout of the article translated into spanish and they asked her, 'why did you do this?' they gave her a warning that if she did it again, she would be fined -- or expelled from the country.\"threats aside, the introduction of email at the university -- one of the few places it's available in havana other than government offices and luxury hotels -- means more information is leaving the country via visiting students.monica (\"like lewinsky,\" she explained helpfully), a 21-year-old from bogota, colombia, was amazed to find she could get an email account when she arrived in havana to study. she and her friend sandra, a spaniard, said they keep their emails simple, limiting their discussions to friends and classwork. politics are studiously avoided.none of the cubans interviewed about email had any illusions about privacy. it's known that every email sent from the university account is automatically copied into an archive. it's equally known that the email is being copied elsewhere, too.\"you know they are opening the mail and looking at it,\" nick said. \"sometimes letters disappear. if it happens with letters, you can only imagine what they do with email.\"every month or so, by magic, there is some problem with the email here and it is shut down for a few days or a week. we always joke that they are using this time to catch up on reading all the emails.\" karla, an art history major, explained that she obtained her email account from a helpful university administrator, but clammed up when a reporter asked further questions. she seemed relieved when the interview ended.another student, pedro, said he uses the account of a student from saudi arabia and comes in every day to email his girlfriend, who lives in northern california.\"i'm so glad for email,\" he said. \"it's so different than communicating by regular mail. sometimes it would take 12 months for a letter to arrive.\"the students using foreigners' email accounts are taking a chance, especially in light of a new anti-sedition law enacted in february. the law increases the penalty to 20 years' imprisonment for any act deemed to undermine the authority of castro's government. if that sounds like a broad legal definition, it's no accident: interpretation is up to the government.how the law is applied remains to be seen, but so far there haven't been any cases involving email. none that have been publicized, at any rate.some cuban students have their own email accounts, although this is limited mostly to graduate students. they are free to contact graduate students in other countries, as long as it's to exchange ideas about things like pulsars in the constellation aquila, or mitochondrial activity in infants.faculty members are also new to email. literature professor guillermo rodrigues rivera was in the middle of planning a trip to italy using email, a much more efficient method than he's endured in the past.\"it's very new. maybe we can all have it within a few months,\" said rodrigues rivera, who taught briefly both at hunter college in new york and in spain. \"cuba has always been open to the world. we are an island in the gulf of mexico between the two americas. cuba made its wealth by its position. we are a country that is open to the world. email is a good way to break the isolation.\""}
