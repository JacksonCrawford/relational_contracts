- - - -network performance isn't the only motive for gathering. there are also more, um, primal reasons.as one enthusiast, mike \"theseus\" payne, writes in a recent email missive, \"you haven't had multiplay fun until you jump up and scream 'aaaahaha, feel that!' right after you put a rocket right up your best bud's posterior.\"gamers worldwide are getting the chance to do just that. over 100 public get-togethers from sydney to baltimore are scheduled in the next month, according to lanparty.com. countless more are being held in basements and living rooms around the world.most start out as -\u00ad and many remain -- friendly, low-key hang-out sessions at a buddy's place, like watching football on a sunday afternoon.but more than a few mutate into something more grandiose, like west deptford, new jersey's new jersey quake iii.for one weekend every month, station 6-6 of the green-fields volunteer fire association in this anonymous philadelphia suburb becomes a computer-gaming mecca. more than 50 devotees bring their own computers and monitors and connect them up on a series of long, fold-out picnic tables. most bring sleeping bags, so they can nap close to the action.the gamers fork over us$35 each, to pay for the room.\"we don't keep a penny for ourselves,\" said one of the organizers, chuck lanard, 25, who volunteers at the fire station and does \"computer odds and ends\" for the state of pennsylvania.with the shades drawn tight and the lights dimmed to candle-strength, the monitors bathe the firehouse in a glow of frozen blue. one warrior puts a disco ball on top of his monitor, another festoons his gear with a gigantic effigy of south park's cartman.the low hum of game-related chatter -- \"nawman, quake iii is way better than quake ii\" -- is punctuated with the occasional victory howl. half-empty boxes of every conceivable fast food lay strewn around the room. gamers used to dorm room battles would, no doubt, be appalled at the lack of beer or bongs. instead, its just the smell of stale pizza and sweaty boys that fills the air.bloody shoot-em-up games like half-life are the most popular. a few gamers test their simulated driving skills, only hours, it would seem, after acquiring their real-life licenses. one kid, no more than 14, watches a pirated version of the new austin powers flick on his computer. the lone female in the place, a teenage girl, feigns interest while her boyfriend salivates over a quake game.\"you're not going to meet your wife at one of these things,\" quips jesse staple, a 21-year-old programmer, who's come from fairfax, virginia, for the party.not all lan parties are so single-minded. at narle (neo amsterdam rave lanevent), party chieftain chris \"dj guru\" vallo spins selections from his 20 gigabytes of techno and ambient mp3s.japanese anime cartoons on 10-foot projection screens entertain overhead. corporate sponsors, like game maker interplay, provide goodies to be raffled away. vallo's wife tends to culinary needs.\"last time, it was seven pounds of ziti and 20 pounds of wings,\" he says.narle happens monthly at the elmsford, new york, courtyard marriott, a hotel catering to business travelers in westchester county, outside of new york city. needless to say, there's a culture clash between the gamers and the suits.\"we've gotten the strangest looks when the doors open. people scatter,\" vallo said.but the glares don't seem to bother party-goers, who are usually too busy blasting each other to bits or playing practical jokes to notice.for example, when \"theseus\" payne and 70 other gamers descend on a hialeah, florida, swimwear factory for the red-eye lanfest, the atmosphere can get pretty juvenile pretty quick.like \"the time when theseus was sleeping and me and stirge stuck our boogers in his nose and he woke up!\" reminisces \"chinchbug\" on the red-eye web site.despite \u00ad- or maybe because of \u00ad- the antics, deep bonds often form at these parties.\"when everyone leaves, i'm disappointed to see them go, and i can't wait till the next month when they'll find the offices again and once again we'll party all night long and play the games we love,\" wrote \"bastard,\" who hosts the los angeles \"beatdown\" event, on lanparty.com.\"people that love the same games generally have a lot in common and get along really well.\""}
