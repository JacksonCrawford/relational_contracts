it means the white-hot us economy might not be set to boil over, as recent gdp numbers suggested, and that inflation isn't yet a going concern.or so some think. bill meehan, chief market analyst at cantor fitzgerald, notes that while the latest napm stats were rosier than anticipated, any index number above 50 is still taken as a sign of expansion in the industrial sector, thus reflecting a persistently robust economy. this will be very much on the minds of federal reserve pooh-bahs when they hold their next get-together on 18 may.\"it's fairly clear,\" meehan warned, \"that as the global economy starts to recover, the fed will take back one of its rate cuts.\"and you just know that wouldn't sit well with investors. expect sentiment to grow increasingly skittish as the next fed meeting draws near.meantime, the courtship dance surrounding cable operator mediaone group has market players fascinated, not least because of the stellar cast involved. mediaone decided over the weekend to accept at&t's us$54 billion buyout offer, thus spurning a rival $48 billion bid from comcast. but this is all just a formality. comcast now has until thursday to come up with a counteroffer, and it should be interesting to see what they manage to put on the table, if anything.comcast reportedly is negotiating with both america online and microsoft about ways to sweeten its deal. while aol might enjoy securing high-speed access to subscribers' homes, few believe bill gates wants to go kicking dirt onto at&t's shoes just to gain a greater toehold in the cable world. in any case, it's a sure bet that lawyers from all sides are racking up some big-time fees this week dickering over possible terms.at&t (t) is the clear winner so far, with its stock advancing 75 cents to $51.25. mediaone (umg) eased $2.31 to $79.31, while comcast (cmcsa) was up $3.06 at $65.94. aol (aol) dropped $9.38 to $133.38, and microsoft (msft) was $1.56 lower at $79.75.(from the for-what-it's-worth file: cnbc said microsoft is also bargaining with at&t over mediaone's assets, and that aol is no longer keen on buddying up with comcast. the sources for these tidbits were the unnamed kind.)in tech, chipmaker vlsi technology (vlsi) rose $1.88 to $20.75 after accepting a new-and-improved acquisition offer from europe's royal philips electronics. philips agreed to boost its original all-cash overture by 24 percent to hit a purchase price of $1.27 billion, representing an 11 percent premium over vlsi's closing price on friday.for its part, intel (intc) gained $1.94 to $63.13 as it unveiled a new breed of microprocessor for hand-held computing devices. separately, intel agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by motorola over alleged theft of trade secrets. terms of the truce weren't disclosed.cantor fitzgerald's meehan feels that tech shares have plenty of room for further setbacks, and that volatility will remain the order of the day among the silicon bunch. \"we're going to go through periods of three days down and then one day up,\" he predicted. \"it's all momentum-driven.\"the momentum was anything but upward for the dot com crowd. amazon.com (amzn) led internet stocks down the hole after barron's figured that, taking into account the money-losing company's revenue, losses, and gross margin, its share price is actually worth no more than $25. while this isn't news to anyone who has watched amazon spill red ink for years, it came as something of a wake-up call to investors, who promptly pitched the company's stock 12 percent lower to $150.94.not even the opening of a nifty new online \"star wars\" store could turn things around for amazon. the force just isn't with them at the moment.theglobe.com (tglo), meanwhile, climbed $1.38 to $61.50 after posting a slimmer-than-expected quarterly loss of 47 cents a share. the online community builder's chief financial officer, frank joyce, termed the result \"another strong quarter.\" and except for the fact that they're not making any money, this is quite true.realnetworks (rnwk) slid $21.44 to $200.06 as it took the wraps off its realjukebox online music player. the mp3-friendly program has plenty of competition, so it remains to be seen if users -- not to mention the music industry -- will embrace realjukebox as the solution everyone's been seeking for electronic distribution of tunes.lastly, circus circus enterprises (cir), one of the biggest us casino operators, soared 23 percent to $25.94 after saying it expects to rake in as much as 42 cents a share in the latest quarter, way ahead of the 25 cents anticipated by analysts. the company credited its good fortune on high occupancy levels at las vegas resorts.which just goes to show that net stocks have a long way to go before replacing slot machines as america's preferred form of gambling."}
