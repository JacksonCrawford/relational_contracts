monitoring the school network for suspicious download activity. by kristen philipkoski.", "author": "kristen philipkoski", "category": "science", "type": "article", "timestamp": "11.13.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "in reaction to the recording industry association of america's recent mp3 piracy crackdown, one university is now monitoring its network using software that can search for music downloads. the riaa recently contacted the university of south carolina spartanburg about a student who had turned his pc into a jukebox and was selling pirated mp3s. since the music was copyrighted, the riaa was reportedly ready to take the student and the university to court.\"just like any traditional campus you have students trying a lot of things, and one was dealing with some music stuff they shouldn't have been doing,\" said gary kendrick, vice chancellor of information technologies at uscs.uscs appeased the riaa by installing a hardware/software system called the kinnetics network system, developed by loran technologies in vienna, virginia, which tracked the student down by his ip address.kendrick said the riaa \"made the university aware of the potential liability and cost of the student\u2019s actions.\"\"that in no way means we were threatening a lawsuit,\" said frank creighton, senior vice president director of anti-piracy at the riaa. \"we request simply that they remove the material. we leave it to the university to decide what action to take.\"\"that's why we started our soundbyting campaign. in every case, universities have always cooperated by having the material removed for us,\" creighton said.but if the riaa was asking questions, there's always the potential for a lawsuit, said michael madison, a visiting assistant law professor at the university of pittsburgh.\"if the riaa is talking to the university of south carolina about potential problems involving mp3 sound files, then in the background somewhere is the threat of a lawsuit,\" madison said.the installation of the kinnetics monitoring system was the vehicle that allowed the issue to end amicably, according to kendrick.\"the riaa found this heavy traffic and traced [it] back to a student in the dorm. they worked with us and worked with the student to assure it would never happen again,\" kendrick said.\"now i can determine whether it's a student abusing the system -- or a faculty or staff member demanding an awful lot of bandwidth,\" kendrick said.the kinnetics system limits streaming activity on dorm computers to prevent similar situations in the future. \"it identifies higher streaming activity, so if somebody is doing video streaming or data streaming it would easily point that out,\" said john virden, executive vice president of loran.uscs is the first school to purchase the system, but the company said it is in talks with several others.the university sponsored a seminar thursday to spread the word about the benefits of tracking network activities using kinnetics. it was attended by several colleges, as well as businesses such as adidas, and the spartanburg regional healthcare system.the discussion between the uscs and the riaa is one of the recent crackdowns on illegal mp3 activity at universities. on 8 november, 71 students' internet access was taken away at carnegie mellon university for alleged illegal mp3 use. in august, university of oregon student jeffrey levy was convicted of mp3 piracy for storing files on his school's servers. he could face up to three years in prison and a us$250,000 fine. his case is scheduled for sentencing on 22 november.although college students are among the most active mp3 pirates, universities often lack the resources to monitor their intranets for copyright infringement.according to the 1998 digital millennium copyright act, internet providers are not responsible for illegal content on their sites, except in certain cases such as when they've been alerted to the problem and did not take action. therefore, when the riaa sends notification, the college or university is required by law to act.\"we don't specifically target universities, they just happen to come up in the queue as we find sites in our general search,\" creighton said.to find mp3 copyright infringements, the riaa uses a team of internet specialists, an automated web crawler, and tips from consumers and music fanskinnetics touts its system as a cheap and easy way for universities to manage their networks and avoid riaa action.\"universities don't normally have the dollars to spend on a big technical staff, and our product is very easy to use because it picks out problems very quickly and it's very intuitive,\" virden said. \"you can be up and running in a matter of weeks, whereas other systems can take months or years.\"some critics argue that installing systems like kinnetics to monitor students' online activity could infringe on students' privacy.\"from the standpoint of the network user, such as a student, it's potentially a very intrusive and invasive management tool because it has essentially eliminated the ability of network users to have any kind of online activity or identity in any private or anonymous fashion,\" madison said.\"the technology allows someone like a university to basically be judge, jury, and executioner with respect to these allegations, and the students have very little ability to raise a good argument that they are not copyright infringers,\" madison said.david weekly, a stanford university student and digital audio consultant who was ordered by the school in 1997 to remove mp3 files from his web site, agreed.\"[universities] can either say 'we can't do anything about this,' which is actually a very reasonable stance, or [they] can say 'we're going to prohibit all music sharing activity -- anyone who's plucking around on a guitar, we're going to shoot them,' and i don't think that's ideal,\" weekly said.\"there doesn't really exist a program to determine which mp3s are illegal,\" he added.mp3 sellers such as emusic said music piracy crackdowns will only increase.\"these and similar actions are going to reduce the number of illegal mp3 files available on the internet. at the same time, services such as emusic are offering mp3 files for sale at very low prices such as 99 cents a track. we believe that if you make the music easier to buy than to steal, they'll buy it,\" said bob kohn, chairman of emusic.not only are illegal files difficult to find, but once found they're often not what the user had in mind.\"the quality of the illegal files is going down dramatically. a lot of garage bands are recording their own music, encoding it in mp3 and filing it under (a popular title such as) 'u2, where the streets have no name,'\" kohn said. \"so students can spend time downloading their favorite song, only to find that it has nothing to do with what they expected.\"\"it's more efficient to pay 99 cents and get an mp3 within minutes, than to spend hours finding and downloading a lower quality recording,\" he added.other online music retailers are appalled by the crackdowns.\"the riaa and most companies in the space have demonstrated such fear of the technology that they have ostensibly restricted the promotional value of mp3,\" said matt wishnow, co-founder of insound, an online music retailer.\"all projections indicate that mp3 will help drive consumer interest in pre-recorded music,\" he added, \"but the riaa is fighting against the value of songs as marketing.\""}
