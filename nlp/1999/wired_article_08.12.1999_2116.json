(any bar-ilan student who prefers online studying is free to register for the vju.)\"we learned that anything that is written they like to print,\" schwartz said. \"we also learned that they liked finding professors and other students online to talk to.\"the students were also inspired by the video clips and began arranging real trips to visit the historical sites, schwartz said.christian educational institutions have also begun getting baptized in the online waters. for example, leadership university offers e-classes in theology for graduate credit from the international school of theology in california, and ici university offers online undergraduate bible and theology courses.other religious schools like the center for buddhist studies in taiwan and pakistan's international institute for islamic studies and research offer a wealth of online resources. however, they have yet to move into e-learning.although the virtual jewish university web site is already live, the full media launch will be at the end of this month, when advertisements will appear on college campuses and in jewish-interest publications across north america.the less net-literate professors will have to learn fast to adapt themselves to online academia. says schwartz: \"we see the virtual jewish university as a very interesting meeting between past and future.\""}
