confidential is only open to attendees of the rat conference. the performance is intended as a preview for future public presentations that, according to lewis, will also utilize avatars, animation, and chat spaces incorporating dialogue from the play. the first public performance, which lewis said will be open to online viewers as well, is tentatively planned in about six months.\"new technology is just getting introduced into the theater world's process of presentation versus their process of creation,\" said cheryl faver, the co-director of the gertrude stein repertory theater, site of the new york portion of the performance. \"but what distinguishes peculiar works is that they are actively producing work that considers new media as tools rather than as ways to achieve special effects.\"indeed, avid followers of \"high tech\" theater may recall 3-d computer graphics used as show-stopping visual devices in ongoing productions by san francisco's george coates performance works and in the latest philip glass opera, monsters of grace. and douglas davis, a new york city performance and web artist, has incorporated streaming video into his production of his theater piece, this is terrible beauty, which has been touring internationally over the past year. in this work, a character in a remote location engages in a conversation, via the internet, with davis, seen onstage.according to lewis, the crew behind private & confidential carefully studied how other theater performers and producers use new technologies to decide what fresh approaches they could bring to the theater experience. lewis cited the web sites of performance channel and franklin furnace as inspiration. both venues regularly stream live, cutting-edge theatrical pieces to online audiences.john reaves, a co-director of the gertrude stein reperatory theater, sees such uses of new media in a theater context as a growing trend.\"it's only natural that theater producers and performers are now requiring computer technology as components in their works,\" said reaves. \"it makes sense, because they have to take into account how their society communicates in order to be truly timely.\""}
