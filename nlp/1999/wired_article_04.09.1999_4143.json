well, forget it. many industry watchers had thought the gloomy forecasts were a bit overdone, and now the wall street journal has arrived on the scene to confirm that, yes, pc makers are doing pretty well, thank you very much.the computer industry should report mostly improved first-quarter results, fueled by double-digit revenue growth for servers, the journal said. in fact, the only dark cloud on the horizon is a possible slowdown in sales due to the y2k glitch, although that's been a convenient catch-all to explain sagging demand for everything from chips to software.\"expectations were too high,\" bill gorman, an analyst with pnc asset management, said of why investors gave such a cold shoulder to pc stocks at the start of the year. \"we got off to a lousy start in january. then it got better in february, and then even better march.\"what a surprise. pc sales typically ease in the first quarter following the holiday buying bonanza. in fact, pc sales have been unusually robust over the past three months, and there's no reason to think that things will worsen in the near future. gorman is predicting a 15 percent hike in unit sales for all of 1999.still, dell (dell) slid us$1.44 to $43.56 after saying it plans to focus more on the low-end pc market, where profit margins are slimmer. after unveiling its first sub-$1,000 models last month, the company said it intends to have \"much more presence and aggressiveness\" in the cheap seats, where joe consumer, as opposed to joe corporation, sits.compaq computer (cpq), meanwhile, advanced $1.25 to $30.88 after demonstrating its commitment to enterprise customers. the company said it had landed a $30 million order from taiwan's hon hai precision industry, a parts maker. and international business machines (ibm) was down 69 cents at $186.31 as it announced plans to be more active in hawking its pcs on the web.\"it will be tough for ibm,\" said pnc's gorman. \"what the world wants ibm to do is get out of the pc business and move everything to dell.\" and this remains a possibility in light of the $16 billion tie-up between the two companies announced last month.from the ipo front, usinternetworking (usix) soared 174 percent to $57.50 on its first day of trading. the company, which allows clients to run business software over the net, debuted with 6 million shares initially priced at $21 each. its chief exec, christopher mccleary, said usinternetworking shouldn't make a dime for at least a \"few years.\"on the other hand, iturf (turf), the online arm of clothing retailer delia's, earned nearly half a million bucks in the last fiscal year, so who could gripe about the company's stock jumping 161 percent to $57.44 on its first trading day? iturf sold 4.2 million shares originally priced at $22 apiece.for its part, extreme networks (extr) rocketed 226 percent to $55.38 after arriving with 7 million shares starting at $17 a pop. the maker of computer switches is seen as a relatively safe internet play -- emphasis on \"relatively\" -- because its products are expected to be increasingly hot as demand grows for high-speed net access. a poor man's cisco, you could say.community builder xoom.com (xmcm) completed a secondary offering of 4 million shares at $66 each, but the day traders had little use for a stock with an actual track record. xoom slipped 19 cents to $70.13. theglobe.com (tglo), meanwhile, was up 34 percent at $78.94 after announcing a two-for-one split just five months after going public.rumor du jour: microsoft (msft) is in talks to acquire online calendar service jump networks, according to the journal. could be. america online, after all, just scooped up when.com for an undisclosed sum, so web-based calendars are clearly the gotta-have-it feature of the moment for online services. microsoft fell 31 cents to $94.25.in biotech, genentech (gne) lost 69 cents to $84.81 after saying it won't seek us approval for a new drug to promote nerve growth in diabetics. laboratory tests failed to show that the drug could deliver the goods. separately, genentech indicated it's close to settling with the government over charges that it illegally sold human growth hormones in the 1980s. the company said a \"potential settlement\" of $50 million is in the works.disney (dis) gained 50 cents to $34.56 as it announced plans to launch a 24-hour soap opera channel on cable. if you don't already know about luke and laura, this isn't for you.lastly, online auctioneer ebay (ebay) rose $11.63 to $183.38 amid continued enthusiasm for electronic gavel-pounding. and here's ebay's 42-year-old ceo, meg whitman, who has exercised her options for the company's shares and, overnight, is worth more than $1 billion. she's now one of the highest-paid execs in the country.hear that? it's the sound of cubicle dwellers at start-ups throughout silicon valley crossing their fingers and saying, \"me next ... me next ... me next....\""}
