hell, why not? anything that distracts attention from tepid earnings reports has to be seen as a plus.nobody on the street actually expects the situation in yugoslavia to have much of an impact on the us economy (except for the defense industry, that is). but the market has been so preoccupied of late with weak corporate results, interest rates, and the uncertain outlook for tech stocks, traders were relieved to have something else to discuss in the final couple hours of trading.the enthusiasm won't last. but even a momentary spurt of confidence is a heck of a lot better than the sheer panic that gripped the market on tuesday.the dow jones industrial average slipped 4.99 points to close at 9666.84, while the wired index was 4.83 higher at 604.75. the nasdaq composite index rose 42.42 to 2365.26, and the s&p 500 was up 6.45 at 1268.59.tech stocks led the way higher. \"they've been the driving force for the market,\" said alexander paris sr., an analyst with barrington research, noting that tech shares have been out in front for trips south as well as north.abby joseph cohen, goldman sachs' relentlessly bullish market guru, did her best to rekindle happy thoughts, but investors were largely unswayed by her optimism. cohen, who has been pretty darn spot-on in past calls, raised her 12-month target for the dow to 10,300 from 9850, and for the s&p 500 to 1325 from 1300.\"a\" for effort, abby.network-equipment maker 3com (coms) paced the tech sector, advancing 81 cents to us$24.44 as it reported quarterly profit of 24 cents a diluted share, a penny higher than estimates. those estimates, however, had been reduced after the company warned of slower sales earlier this month, so the better-than-expected showing is something of a hollow victory.computer makers rebounded from all those gloomy predictions about the pc business entering a prolonged slump. dell computer (dell) rose $2.81 to $38.50 after saying it anticipates a 70 percent increase in shipments to the asia-pacific region this year (excluding japan, which remains mired in economic cluelessness). dell is most optimistic about sales growth in china and australia.barrington's paris figures that traders will gradually become more forgiving of slower growth in the pc business. \"when you have an industry that goes up 40 percent last year, what do you do for an encore?\" he asked.for its part, international business machines (ibm) gained $4.63 to $170 as it inked a five-year, $3 billion accord to provide computer parts to data-storage dynamo emc. the deal echoes that of big blue's $16 billion pact with dell, and indicates that ibm is quite serious about positioning itself as a leading supplier of high-tech components. emc (emc) was $5.25 higher at $119.13.bad news for other component manufacturers? could be. take a look at read-rite (rdrt), a maker of recording heads for disk drives, which dropped 21 percent to $6.13 after warning it will report a loss for the current quarter. analysts had been looking for profit of 7 cents a share, but the company now foresees sales decreasing by about 10 percent from the previous quarter, when it posted income of 2 cents a share.another internet company went public. you'll never guess what happened.actually, you could see this coming a mile off. miningco.com (mine), the human-centric search service, surged 90 percent to $47.50 after debuting with 3 million shares initially priced at $25 apiece. displaying an impeccable net pedigree, miningco lost nearly $16 million last year, compared with almost $9 million a year earlier. a solid investment by anyone's standard.america online (aol), meanwhile, fell $3.50 to $117.50 after saying it will slash as many as 1,000 jobs from its payroll to accommodate the company's $10 billion purchase of netscape communications. separately, brown brother harriman downgraded aol's stock to short-term \"neutral\" from \"buy.\" analyst dawn simon said the move \"was based strictly on the basis of price.\"henry blodget was keeping busy in his new gig as internet guy at merrill lynch. lycos (lcos), soon-to-be parent of wired news, climbed $5.19 to $91.69 as blodget handed the portal's stock a near-term \"accumulate\" rating, while infoseek (seek) was down $1.88 at $77.13 after receiving the same designation.blodget said lycos has been looking rejuvenated of late amid hopes that its stormy merger with usa networks \"might be altered or called off.\" but he added that \"if the deal goes through unchanged, we believe the stock may fall (initially, anyway).\" seems like a safe enough call.speaking of corporate marriages, cosmetics queen revlon (rev) soared 31 percent to $22.38 on speculation that the company is on the verge of acquisition. unilever, the european household-goods conglomerate, is seen as the most likely suitor for revlon's affections.lastly, it's our old buddy bill \"not a monopolist\" gates confirming that microsoft is indeed keen to settle its antitrust case with the government -- but only if the company remains free to integrate features into its windows operating system. \"as long as we can keep those intact,\" he said, \"we want to settle.\"of course, one man's feature is another man's browser, but that's beside the point. microsoft (msft) was up $4.69 at $171.25."}
