with streaming media in the blueprints for next year, the ncaa is sure to raise the question of whether a technological snafu could corrupt an event.\"technology is like anything else,\" said freas. \"there's a problem when there's lightning on the football field. there are always clock problems in hockey games ... it's how we cope with the problems that really matters.\"freas says his interest in technology was born of a desire to advance his sport.\"it's really the interest of my sport that got me going on this,\" he said. \"i'm one of those old guys that rebelled and then got captured by how neat technology is. i'm just like everyone else now ... ordering a faster modem, trying to get everything current and up to speed.\"hardman, the assistant coach, has watched freas' enthusiasm grow. \"he's already thinking three steps ahead for next year ... where all this could go in the future. he's exploring all the possible offshoots.\"\"sam loves doing this kind of stuff,\" said uh swimmer folker. \"i wouldn't want to do it all the time though. i mean, i like traveling. i enjoy the emotion of [meeting in person].\"but freas is on a mission.\"if we can put a man on the moon, we can get a swim meet on the web.\""}
