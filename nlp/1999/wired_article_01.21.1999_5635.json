(he didn't, however, volunteer what he discovered.)\"now, do i need a tutorial?\" he demanded.\"it doesn't sound like you do, your honor,\" beeson meekly admitted.reed's 11th-floor courtroom is peppered with a dozen videocameras, and the cables snaking across the floor are so thick that he has to warn witnesses taking the stand to step carefully over the wires.he even suggested cybercasting proceedings in the copa trial, which began wednesday and is expected to continue through next week. \"it would seem that the defendant could make a copy of whatever they want,\" he told government attorneys in november, and then broadcast it online. so far, though, the justice department hasn't taken him up on his offer.he boasts that he's wired his courtroom before with half a dozen pcs during the protocom v. fluent case. that trial involved a dispute over computer software. today reed is a regular user of lotus court calendar and the dcm network, a closed system linking federal judges and court administrative offices around the country.still, \"i have a lot of idiosyncrasies,\" he readily admits. one of them: a ban on faxes. all documents must be submitted to him in hardcopy, the old-fashioned way.another foible: reed has a self-proclaimed tendency to ramble and think aloud, a characteristic that alternately irks and amuses courtroom observers.\"the chief judge of the circuit told me i'd never make a commentator on 60 minutes, and i said, 'good.'\""}
