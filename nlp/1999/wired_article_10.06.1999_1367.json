biggest margin ever thanks to light trucks and suvs. environmentalists lobby the white house to pay attention. from the environment news service.", "author": "environment news service", "category":

efficiency of 1999 model cars is only 23.8 miles per gallon -- the lowest it has been since 1980 -- a new study by the us environmental protection agency has found. the agency's review shows that advances in fuel efficiency in some passenger cars has been more than offset by booming sales of thirsty trucks and sport utility vehicles.the picture seems unlikely to improve, as the fiscal year 2000 budget for the department of transportation (dot), passed monday by the us senate, would block the federal government from enacting, or even studying, higher fuel efficiency standards for vehicles.fuel efficiency standards are an important way to combat pollution and other environmental problems. fuel economy is directly related to carbon dioxide emissions, the most prevalent pollutant associated with global warming. light vehicles, including passenger cars, contribute about 20 percent of all us carbon dioxide emissions.the study represents the first time in three years that the epa has taken a comprehensive look at fuel economy trends. it finds that average fuel economy was highest in the 1987 and 1988 model years, when it reached an average of 25.9 miles per gallon. the figure has been falling since then, and has accelerated its downward rate in recent years.the 23.8 mile per gallon figure for 1999 model autos represents a 0.6 mile per gallon drop from 1998 models -- the steepest decline since the epa began keeping records in 1975.to achieve required corporate average fuel economy (cafe) standards, automakers have offset the lower fuel economy of trucks and sport utility vehicles (suvs) by introducing smaller, lighter cars that get high gas mileage. light trucks, for example, are required to average at least 20.7 miles per gallon, but 1999 models average only 20.3 miles per gallon.automakers avoid federal fines by using credits built up by exceeding the minimum standards, either on average or with individual models, in previous years. those credits are running out, because suvs and trucks are rolling off dealer lots much faster than more fuel-efficient cars.sales of light duty trucks, which include suvs, minivans, and pickup trucks, have risen steadily for 20 years and now make up 46 percent of the us market. sales of suvs have risen from less than 200,000 in 1975 to almost three million in 1999 -- 20 percent of the market.meanwhile, market share for new passenger cars and wagons has fallen from 81 to 54 percent. based on their lower average fuel economies and projected longer useful lives, epa estimates that new light duty trucks sold in 1999 will consume, over their lifetimes, almost 60 percent of the fuel used by all of the new vehicles sold in 1999.consumer demand has led to the introduction of increasingly large suv models. in february, ford motor company unveiled the ford excursion, the largest suv ever manufactured. the excursion, 19 feet long and weighing 3.5 tons, gets a paltry 12 miles to a gallon of gas.\"the auto industry has made record profits on expensive suvs while refusing to give suv customers the best fuel saving technology available,\" says katherine silverthorne of the us public interest research group. \"ford just began selling a car designed to go 12 miles per gallon. it's outrageous that they would purposely create a car that emits more global warming pollution and costs its owners so much more at the gas pump.\"environmentalists want the federal government to make legal changes that would force automakers to make cleaner, greener vehicles. one important rule, the cafe standards, has been held steady by congressional moratoriums preventing the use of federal dollars to study changes.congress passed the cafe law in 1975 to conserve oil and improve us gas mileage. from 1975 to 1989, cafe rules helped double the nation's fuel economy. since 1989, fuel economy has remained stagnant.current cafe rules require cars to achieve an average standard of 27.5 miles per gallon. the house version of the dot budget has included a moratorium on cafe changes in every bill since 1995. this year, the senate bill also includes the moratorium rider.in a letter to president bill clinton, which was expected to be delivered tuesday, eight environmental groups urged a veto on the fiscal year 2000 dot budget unless the moratorium language is removed.\"we need your leadership to defeat this rider,\" the letter says. \"as a united community, we have built strong senate support for the fuel economy issue. it would be an enormous loss to let this unconscionable provision become law.\"for
