more than just your average rc modeler, that's for sure. \"it's a mechanical engineering contest, really,\" said frank jenkins, a robotics consultant from palo alto, california, who served on the safety committee for the show.for the private competitor, a robot can cost a minimum of $500, but if they want to be competitive, it will cost as much as $10,000. many competitors are from special effects companies, like san francisco's industrial light and magic and disney's imagineering. \"they do this professionally and like mechanical things,\" said jenkins.\"models are often used in the special effects world anyway, so this is their thing.\"there are also families in this show, too. the central california washburns entered scorpion, a menacing creature almost three feet tall with a long \"stinger.\"family patriarch ray is a machinist from modesto who works on farm equipment when he's not refining scorpion with sons shane, an industrial designer, and john, a paramedic. the nasty pincers in the front of scorpion were inspired by the jaws of life, which john uses in his work.two nephews also help out. \"we go in different directions during the rest of the year and don't get together as often as possible, so this is a chance for a family effort,\" ray said.all told, they've invested about $2,000 in scorpion.the winner, however, was the otherwise nondescript biohazard, a short, squat block of titanium that in the end proved to be invincible.biohazard stands less than six inches tall and is trapezoid shaped. but it's also made of titanium 3/16th of an inch thick and weighs 191 pounds, more than its owner, carlo bertochinni, a mechanical engineer from menlo park, california. bertochinni runs robot-aficionado web site robotbooks.com.biohazard has a hydraulic arm used to pin or flip competitors. in 1996 and 1997 at another robot competition called \"robot wars,\" biohazard won the one-on-one competition.it also won awards for best design and best engineering in 1996 and a melee contest in 1997, where all of the remaining functioning robots at the end of the show got into the arena for a final battle royale. \"i don't think i've ever seen him bring a tool box,\" said josh pines, a member of the show safety committee. \"he just plugs it into a battery and charges it up.\"for this show bertochinni did bring a tool box, but it sat unused as biohazard charged up in between matches. bertochinni knows his bot is a target. \"they'll keep getting wiser,\" he said. \"if they don't get me this time, they will the next time.\"as it turned out, bertochinni had nothing to worry about. biohazard's low profile and sloped form allowed it to slip right under the wheels of competitors, and the hydraulic arm flipped them right over. while one faceoff after another ended in draws elsewhere, biohazard won every battle handily.\"there's a $25,000 purse, but even if i win, it still won't pay for the robot,\" bertochinni said, noting biohazard's titanium structure. \"on the other hand, who knows what it could turn into in the future?\""}
