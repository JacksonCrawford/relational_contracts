former german ally, mannesmann ag, in a hostile takeover. mannesmann stands its ground.", "author": "reuters", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "12.20.1999 10:35 AM", "text": "frankfurt -- only hours after vodafone airtouch declared its intention to formally pursue a hostile takeover of mannesmann ag on monday, the german telecom made it clear that it will not submit meekly. mannesmann continued to reject vodafone's takeover bid, which the british telecom giant made official when it said it would post the necessary document on thursday.\"it is a matter of extreme regret that vodafone insists on pursuing this hostile route.... having reviewed the vodafone statement, mannesmann continues to reject the offer since the case advanced by vodafone is as unattractive as ever,\" mannesmann said in a statement.the d\u00fcsseldorf-based telecom and engineering company reiterated its belief that a combined vodafone-mannesmann group would grow considerably more slowly than an independent mannesmann.it said the offer would \"destroy the unique strengths of mannesmann's portfolio,\" specifically the integration of wireless, wireline, internet, and tele-commerce services.\"it still has no strategic appeal to mannesmann shareholders,\" the company said. \"most significantly, the combination would fail to offer control over assets in any single additional important market.\"earlier monday, vodafone, the world's biggest cell phone group, said it would give mannesmann shareholders 46 days to accept a record hostile takeover of 135 euros ($us136.2 billion) -- and would start counting on friday.vodafone also said bid was no longer conditional on european commission clearance.\"the advice we've had is that we do not believe there will be major competitive problems other than [mannesmann's acquisition of british cell phone group] orange,\" a spokesman said. \"and we've agreed that we will demerge orange and believe that will be enough to satisfy the commission.\"in trying to reassure mannesmann investors that its historic takeover would not fall at regulatory hurdles, the spokesman said: \"it's a risk we think is worth taking.\"vodafone has opted against keeping its bid open for a full 60 days, setting instead a closing date for its bid of 7 february 2000. and it warned mannesmann shareholders not to hold out for a higher offer, reiterating that its bid was final.\"we have set our timetable to bring our offer to a rapid conclusion so that we can move quickly to take full advantage of the opportunities available to the new group,\" ceo chris gent said in a statement.urging mannesmann to accept an offer to create europe's leading telecom company in mobile voice, data, and internet, he added: \"we firmly believe it is in the best interests of mannesmann shareholders, customers, and employees and will continue to seek a recommendation from mannesmann's management.\"vodafone, which insists it remains confident of setting a new precendent by winning a hostile bid in germany, launched an all-share bid in november that currently values its partner in germany, italy, and france at around 265 euros per share. mannesmann's shares, which touched a record 240 euros earlier on monday, ended one euro lower at 235, narrowing the discount to the offer price that has stretched to around 25 percent to about 10 percent, as investors bet on vodafone's success.vodafone, which has been canvassing top institutional investors about its takeover ambitions, plans to hold an extraordinary shareholder meeting on 24 january to seek formal approval for the bid.the group's offer document is likely to contain additional information about how german investors can get around problems limiting their shareholdings in companies which do not have their primary listing in germany.once vodafone files the tender offer, mannesmann has 14 days to respond with its defense, although it can ask for an extension. its defense will then spark a second round of transatlantic roadshows as both camps seek investor support.stung into action by the german group's $32 billion bid for its domestic archrival orange plc, vodafone is battling to protect lucrative joint ventures in germany and italy -- d2 mobilfunk and onmitel -- which mannesmann controls.mannesmann's agreed bid for orange in october confirmed vodafone's fears that mannesmann was setting out its own european agenda in a move that could leave the british-based group's continental ambitions in tatters.the fast-growing german group, whose ambitious ceo klaus esser has been credited with creating one of europe's most dynamic telecom companies, has consistently accused vodafone of undervaluing its assets.both companies claim shareholder support after pleading their cases during initial international roadshows. but both have also said it remains unclear how investors will vote until they have seen the details of the offer document.copyright"}
