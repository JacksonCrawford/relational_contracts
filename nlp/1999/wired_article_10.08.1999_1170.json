rat neonatal cells using a device called the bioreactor. researchers at the massachusetts institute of technology, harvard medical school, boston university, and brigham and women's hospital collaborated on the effort.\"right now we have something that resembles cardiac tissue and has electrical properties that resemble cardiac tissue,\" said lisa freed, a research scientist at mit who supervised the research, which appears in the september issue of <a class=\"external-link\"

href=\"http://library.med.nyu.edu/library/internet/ejournal/titles/amjphysiol.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">american journal of physiology</a>, the researchers defined for the first time how the electrical aspects of the tissue work, and the mechanism of their growth.the electrical properties cause the tissue to contract and cause the beating mechanism.the bioengineered tissue could eventually be used to repair damaged heart tissue inside the body, test new drugs, and study cardiac tissue development and function.the researchers hope to some day build a completely bioengineered heart. but first, they need to create bigger and stronger cell constructs. they also must translate the experiment into human cells so a bioengineered organ won't be rejected.\"it's really hard to predict that, it depends on how fast and how well the research goes,\" freed said. \"but maybe 10 to 20 years -- if we can get to mars by then we could maybe get some heart tissue. this is the very first step.\"the next immediate step for the researchers is to create heart tissue with blood vessels.\"right now the tissue is too thin to be of use for anything more than scientific purposes. we need vessels to get some gasses and nutrients to those cells,\" freed said.the tissue was grown in a bioreactor that rotates constantly to keep the cells in an endless free-fall state -- a microenvironment that tricks cells into thinking they're actually inside a body.the rotating bioreactor supplies cells with nutrients and gases and at the same time removes waste. a 5-millimeter in diameter by 2-millimeter thick scaffold-type structure supports the new cell growth.the device is made of cans filled with liquid containing the cells. since the bioreactor is constantly rotating, the cells never hit the bottom of the container, which keeps them in a permanent free-fall state and allows them to grow in three dimensions.\"you set the spinning of the bioreactor to match rate of the fall of the cells through the media so they never reach the bottom,\" said robert richmond, cell and radiation biologist at the marshall space flight center.\"they're continually falling very gently so there's very little turbulence. they're less agitated and chemically talk to each other better -- so when they're finished they grow in ways that look more tissue-like,\" he said.\"the bioreactor approach is a very effective way of allowing cells to come together to reform a tissue. we don't fully understand it, but it works very well,\" said peter f. davies, director of the institute for medicine and engineering at the university of pennsylvania.the researchers originally experimented with growing cells in space between september 1996 and january 1997 when they engineered cartilage aboard the mir space station, and were able to keep it alive for four months. soon after that, freed engineered heart tissue for the first time.researchers may soon have available to them a controversial option for bioengineering tissue if the government agrees to allow scientists to use embryonic stem cells for experiments.\"over the next few years your could see a huge explosion in stem cell biology,\" davies said. \"right now there are restraints on using embryonic tissue in research.\"but if the laws change and stem cells are available for research, they could engender significant advances in tissue engineering, davies said. when scientists piece cells together, they're hoping that the biological cues to allow the cells to function properly will remain intact.\"but the information to build the tissue is already in the stem cells,\" davies said. \"nature will do the job for you, because the fundamental genes are programmed into the stem cells.\""}
