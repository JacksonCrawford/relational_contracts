there's the rub.the pared-down german is clearly preferred on the internet, in newsgroups, and chat rooms. the umlaut and the ess-tsett do not exist in internet addresses, and are unlikely to make a comeback, predicts the linguist schlobinski.these cosmetic changes do not bother traditionalists so much. they are limited to a digital world which traditionalists have been slow to inhabit. more infuriating has been the seemingly blistering pace at which germans have adopted english words to describe technology.the fledgling organization for the preservation of the german language is waging a war against such new verbs as \"downloaden.\"in two years, this private organization has garnered 3,000 members, all of whom pay dues to support the cause. when the institute for the german language proposed that the words \"upgrade\" and \"downloaden\" be incorporated into german dictionaries, traditionalists revolted.\"i simply cannot understand this proposal,\" raged the organization's president, walter kr\u00e4mer. \"for a large portion of the english computer jargon there are perfect and often better german words.\" efforts like these garner chuckles. in the 50 years since world war ii, the vast majority of germans wear their patriotism lightly if at all, and this attitude extends to language.\"pure ideology,\" jibes linguist schlobinski, who considers english words a practical solution to the problem of how to describe a global medium.english words are also a sign of cosmopolitanism in a country where politicians who speak no foreign languages are the butt of jokes in educated society. the professionals do not worry about the advent of \"denglish,\" as the traditionalists like to call the german of the late 20th century.schlobinski also cautions against panicking about the imminent loss of the language, if only because the technology that has wrought these changes has shown a remarkable potential for changing itself. earlier in the computer age, all the world was learning dos command lines in english. but the graphical interface made words that were once necessary superfluous -- in any language.the tendency of germans to incorporate technology into their daily lives slowly, if at all, will also act as a brake on the internet's influence on language. in official written communication, nouns are still capitalized and umlauts are still required. and letters begin with the phrase \"very honored so-and-so.\" inconceivable in an internet chat room, but still a very familiar phrase in germany.tradition will not go quietly. not yet, anyway."}
