(appeals are heard by panels of three judges.)\"he also -- no surprise -- predicted that microsoft will win the case.was the apparent leak of the document to ralph nader's organization -- which then immediately sent it out to journalists -- intentional? it's hard to say. but microsoft doesn't seem to mind everyone reading such confident predictions.\"this is essentially how they want people to describe the case,\" said jamie love, who recirculated the memo. \"it also comes across as pretty defiant, almost as microsoft is continuing to deny they're getting their ass kicked in the court. it shows the tone inside the bunkers.\""}
