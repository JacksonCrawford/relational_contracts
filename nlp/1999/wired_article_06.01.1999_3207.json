it didn't occur to me what happened until about 20 years later. but at least she sent me back to the boca raton radar school and not to timbuktu!__ gaines m. crookgmcrook@paclink.net ____ fact and fiction __reading \"exile.com\" (wired 7.01, page 108) about kevin poulsen being punished for hacking by being banned from computers during his probation, i was surprised you didn't mention isaac asimov's \"a perfect fit\" (1981). the main character of the story can barely live in his contemporary world because he has been conditioned against using computers - for the crime of hacking. he has to con a 9-year-old into ordering a dinner for him because the restaurants are computerized.score another prediction for science fiction.__ walt cheeverwaltc@mnic.net ____ screen door __liesl schillinger's story on the onion (\"award-winning local journalists reflect own self-hatred back on nightmarish world,\" wired 7.03, page 106) was informative, funny, and timely.i am a teacher living in saudi arabia, where censorship is strict - the government wants all the new technology but none of the information. fortunately, satire and sarcasm aren't as easily recognized as an absolut ad. the zealots who screen publications don't catch the subtle and not-so-subtle differences that make the onion hilarious.__ scott phillipsrsphillips@vinnellarabia.com ____ thumbs up, thumbs down __i enjoyed liesl schillinger's piece on the onion, except for one part: \"... its volatile charms remained the eccentric passion of students and anarcho-syndicalist academics in madison (home of the university of wisconsin) and a handful of humor buffs in new york and los angeles.\"you coastal types are so smug! the onion was famous in chicago long before anyone in new york or los angeles heard of it. i could pick it up free at my local white hen, for chrissakes!__ roger ebertchicago ____ is it hot in here? __with \"leisure\" wedged into the 10 minutes before you leave to catch a flight and \"fun\" defined as reading email, \"the pleasure binge\" (wired 7.03, page 86) brings to mind the conversation between faustus and mephistopheles in marlowe's doctor faustus. when mephistopheles freely admits he is a devil, faustus asks why he's not in hell. \"why this is hell,\" mephistopheles replies, \"nor am i out of it.\"by the way, you might have picked someone more objective to analyze the values and structure of the entertainment culture than a senior partner of the media and entertainment group of booz-allen & hamilton.__ robert v. lancasterrlanc@fix.net ____ electric charge __readers of electrifying times have expressed their dismay at the glaring omission of our magazine and its web site from \"suck amps!\" (wired 7.03, page 124) by charles platt. we're regarded by fans of ev drag racing as the trade publication for the emerging new sport. we're working really hard and struggling in a market dominated by slick automotive titles selling more of the same internal combustion. our address, www.electrifyingtimes.com, should have been right below the nedra address in the \"more juice\" sidebar (page 165).__ remy chevalierremyc@prodigy.net ____ for the record __\"listen up\" (wired 7.03, page 138) sent shivers down my spine. finally, an artist with the foresight to see that mp3 will decentralize the music industry and bring record labels to their knees by putting power where it should be, in the artists' hands.i disagree with chuck d's comparison of bill gates and michael jordan. jordan got where he is through hard work. gates got away with stealing what he could, and backing himself up with lawyers.big difference.__ brody hurstkagenin@cyberspace.org ____ trademurk __the \"mp4\" format that public enemy is using is not the real mp4 format, but a proprietary trademark issued to global music one. this company is trying to make a quick buck off consumer demand for the mpeg-4 standard, which is defined by the international organization for standardization.while i like public enemy's music, and support its fight for open music, the group's deal with global music one smacks of opportunism, and wired's celebrity-worship allows this questionable behavior to go unchallenged.__ eric scheirereds@media.mit.edu ____ undo __cryptographic problems: a production error partially encrypted a piece of malcolm williamson's work history (\"the open secret,\" wired 7.04, page 113); for \"\ufffd6,\" read: \"himself working on cryptographic problems.\" ... numbering the aeons: there are six shorts (seven if you count the first season) in the complete aeon flux (\"state of flux,\" wired 7.01, page 148). ... prom not: the four chips shown on page 132 of \"this is not a test\" (wired 7.04) are srams, not eproms.__ send your rants & raves to: __email: rants@wiredmag.comsnail mail: wired, po box 191826 san francisco, ca 94109-9866editorial guidelines: guidelines@wiredmag.comeditorial correspondence: editor@wiredmag.com"}
