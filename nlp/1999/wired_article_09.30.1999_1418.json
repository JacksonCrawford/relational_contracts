been awarded the nobel prize for literature.", "author": "reuters", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "09.30.1999 02:00 PM", "text": "novelist guenter grass, whose richly imaginative books facing up to the shame of nazism have made him germany's best-known postwar writer, was awarded the nobel prize for literature thursday. for the 71-year-old author of the tin drum the prize bolstered his standing as a moral arbiter of post-unity germany who has untiringly warned his compatriots to remain vigilant against racism.the nobel academy in stockholm, sweden, honored grass as one of the most prominent authors to emerge from a group of young intellectuals who set out to revive german literature after the nazi era.grass is widely admired by his literary contemporaries, but also controversial for his outspoken political stands.the man who once said the horrors of auschwitz could not have occurred without a strong germany was horrified at the nation's quick unification in 1990 after the fall of the berlin wall, and has never shed his fear that germany may stray again.\"it can't be that my children and grandchildren will have to suffer under the stigma of being german,\" he told a news conference after thursday's announcement. but these late-born children also have a share of the responsibility for ensuring that such things, even their stirrings, never happen in germany again.\"grass has also infuriated politicians in recent years with critiques of \"barbaric\" capitalism taking over after communism and by attacking german immigration policy as racist.his literary reputation was made with the tin drum, cat and mouse and dog years, published between 1959 and 1963.with the tin drum, the nobel academy said, \"it was as if german literature had been granted a new beginning after decades of linguistic and moral destruction.\" the book's main character, oskar matzerath, refuses to grow up under the nazi regime, staying a dwarf in protest and beating his tin drum as a warning. german director volker schloendorff later based a movie on the book.combining naturalistic detail with fantastical images, the novel trilogy captured the german reaction to the rise of nazism, the horrors of the war and the guilt that lingered after adolf hitler's defeat.grass drew on his own experience of military service in the nazi air force late in world war ii and his captivity as a prisoner of war held by the americans.again and again, his books returned to his native town of danzig (now gdansk, poland), a symbol of germany's painful relationship with its neighbors.\"his writing had a great political significance, especially in the renaissance of germany after the world war,\" 1991 nobel laureate nadine gordimer told the associated press. \"he never failed to confront germans with what they did, but always with a great sense of the vitality.\"in germany, some reactions were more muted. chancellor gerhard schroeder honored grass as a \"competent critic of society.\" his culture minister, michael naumann, called him a \"difficult, imaginative author.\"many of grass' more recent works received decidedly mixed reviews. his 1995 novel \"a broad field\" attempted to explain germany's new identity after unification, but many critics said it fell short.grass and other german writers of his generation are criticized in a recent book, the language of silence, by ernestine schlant, a professor of german and comparative literature at new jersey's montclair state university.schlant, the german-born wife of democratic presidential candidate bill bradley, says the writers' books virtually ignore the holocaust and experiences of jews.grass' latest work, my century, is a collection of short pieces reviewing german history, coupled with an exhibition of grass watercolors. the book is to be published in 23 languages by the end of next year.grass was painting at his house in the northern german town of behlendorf when the academy called to say he had won the prize, and left immediately after the call to keep a dentist appointment. he said he would funnel the award, worth $960,000 this year, into three foundations he has set up.grass said his first thought was of heinrich boell, the 1972 literature laureate and the last german to win the prize. he said he was happy not to have won the prize himself then, saying it would have been a burden for a still-young writer. \"at my age, i will gladly take the prize,\" he quipped.praise poured in from other literary colleagues. british author salman rushdie, in a statement through his agent, called grass \"the greatest european novelist of the second half of the 20th century.\"now, grass suggested it was up to new generations of german writers to pursue his legacy.\"one thing is sure: the century that is about to start can no longer be my century.\"copyright"}
