its shares rose $1.13 to $35.75 amid hopes the company would beat estimates when it posted its quarterly returns after the market closed. profit of 57 cents a share was expected, but traders were actually looking for apple to blow past this number just as it did in the previous quarter.at home (athm) fell 13 percent to $159.06 after just hitting estimates with a pro forma quarterly loss of 7 cents a share, excluding charges. while analysts were generally upbeat about the cable-based access provider's results -- revenue was up 30 percent -- investors apparently were hoping for more in light of all the recent press about at home's merger with excite.similarly, traders are getting harder to please as far as america online (aol) is concerned. the planet's biggest online service lost $7.94 to $151.38 even as it announced that worldwide membership has increased 42 percent from a year ago to more than 17 million. moreover, each aol member is averaging 55 minutes a day online, or 10 minutes more than a year earlier.infoseek (seek) tumbled 24 percent to $60.38 as it reported a quarterly loss of 39 cents a share. this wasn't quite as bad as anticipated, but was still sufficient for a pair of brokerages to downgrade the portal's stock. should be interesting to see whether this heats up or chills disney's enthusiasm about taking a controlling stake in infoseek as the two cobble together their go network.from the ipo front, database software maker sagent technology (sgnt) climbed 73 percent to $15.56 on its first day of trading. the company debuted with 5 million shares initially priced at $9 each. sagent lost nearly $14 million last year.microsoft (msft) unveiled a new pirate-proof player for online music, but managed to dazzle investors about as much as it's dazzled the music industry, which isn't yet sure it wants to party with the kids from redmond. international business machines and realnetworks are working on their own music format, and apple's latest version of quicktime will handle the popular mp3 standard, which should please more than a few net-smart music fans. microsoft's stock fell $4.25 to $85.88.lucent technologies (lu) has watched its share price lose ground recently amid speculation the maker of telecom gear would report weak earnings. the company put a halt to such rumors by announcing that it expects to meet or exceed the expected profit of 15 cents a share. its stock promptly reversed course and gained $2.06 to $59.for its part, motorola (mot) advanced 69 cents to $83.63 after breezing past estimates with first-quarter profit of 28 cents a diluted share. the company credited the solid showing to increased sales of digital wireless phones and improvement in the semiconductor business. motorola execs told analysts that second-quarter income could be as high as 42 cents a share.lastly, intuit (intu) lost $6.88 to $96.75 after the electronic-filing system for its widely used turbotax software went on the fritz for more than 14 hours tuesday. although everything was up and running again by mid-afternoon, the glitch sent shivers through would-be taxpayers staring down thursday's deadline. well over a million people file their returns via intuit's service.another scare like this, and the internal revenue service will face an even steeper uphill battle in getting us all to switch to money-saving (for them) electronic forms. on the other hand, the lines are already growing at the post office."}
