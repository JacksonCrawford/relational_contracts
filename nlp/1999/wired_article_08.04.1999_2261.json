this will help you predict its traits,\" said mishler. \"if you're looking for a cure for cancer, you don't want to go out randomly and look at every plant in the forest.\"until recently, most biological study has taken place in relative isolation, with individual laboratories examining specific life forms -- without a consistent mechanism to interrelate data.but the deep green project (officially known as the green plant phylogeny research coordination group) has charted in detail the genetic relationships of 100 green plants representing all the major branches of the green plant world.the project is jointly funded by the national science foundation, the us department of energy, and the department of agriculture.in the future, the group plans to fill in the \"twigs of those branches,\" said mishler, with the eventual goal of mapping out the relationships between all green plants.deep green plans to share its methodology and technology with scientists studying the other four major kingdoms: red plants, brown plants, fungi, and animals.crucial to the project was the role of new technologies. advances in gene sequencing technologies allow data to be quickly compiled.but even more important, said mishler, was the internet and parallel-processing computers.\"the phylogenies of this scale couldn't even be considered until computer hardware was complex enough to handle the algorithmic problems of building these trees of interrelationship,\" said mishler. \"the possible branching phylogenic trees for a few hundred species would be more than the number of atoms in the universe.\"furthermore, the presentation of the interrelationships would have been all but impossible on paper.\"there's no way to present this in a flat, linear text-based way; hypertext is the only way to really do it,\" said mishler.to coordinate the effort, mishler and company faced cultural challenges within the field. traditionally, plant biologists have worked \"in a kind of tribal culture,\" alone or in small labs, and have carefully guarded their research out of fear of being scooped, said krishtalka.\"we had to convince people to share what they're doing,\" said mishler. \"there was a lot of duplication of effort out there, which is a waste.... our field has had to make a transition from even five years ago, where the field was oriented to the individual investigator, toward a 'big science' approach, wherein collaboration takes place.\"this cultural shift has implications beyond the deep green project, said krishtalka.\"the grand questions of biodiversity and biocomplexity will require interdisciplinary collaboration in a way that has never occurred before, and this project certainly advances toward that.\"related wired links:<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.wired.com/news/images/pix155.gif\"/>super trees not pulp fiction28.jul.99europe halts genetic corn trade20.may.99world species webified11.aug.98"}
