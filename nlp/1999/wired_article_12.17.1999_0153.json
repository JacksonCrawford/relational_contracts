(i downloaded a 4mb song from my laptop to the ravemp, via parallel port, in about 25 seconds.)however, i did run into some problems getting the parallel port connection just right on the ravemp and the mp 1000. it took 10 to 15 minutes of troubleshooting to get it right.beefssure you can bump and shake these players all around without missing a beat, but what happens when the open slots for flash cards and usb/printer cable get ripped up, or the player gets wet, or too much dust collects in it? that's why i feel more confident with models without exposed openings. if we're lucky, a new generation of built-in 128mb portables will be out before disaster happens.one annoying aspect of several of these players is that they bundle the cheap version of musicmatch software, which limits your mp3 ripping to files at 96kbps. for my ear, 128kbps is the bare minimum encoding rate, and i often choose to rip at higher rates to ensure my files sound decent.if i bother to install new software on my already-crowded computer, i don't want it to be crippled software.so if you're picky about sound quality (not that mp3 really is), don't even bother installing musicmatch and use a real ripper. alternatively, shell out $30 and get the full version of musicmatch.and what's with those flash memory cards? if i can't take the card and upload songs from it to another player or pc -- one of the \"protections\" built into these players -- then what's the advantage over onboard memory?if the ravemp and others have 64mb built-in, why should i have to fiddle around with fickle cards -- where the contents could be altered by low-battery power?one of the odd consequences of this whole mp3 wave is the temptation to swap my truck's snazzy alpine cd player for a damn cassette player so i can use some of the adapters that come with these mp3 gizmos.is that what's meant by backward compatible?"}
