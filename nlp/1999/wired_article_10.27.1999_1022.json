doesn't mean it's easy to get kids and teens to your e-commerce site. by lakshmi chaudhry.", "author": "lakshmi chaudhry", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "10.27.1999 03:00

million kids who love to surf and shop.united states census bureau figures show that these 10- to 24-year-olds have us$250 billion worth of disposable income. teenagers alone spend a staggering $140 billion each year in the real world.and these kids are online. but are they buying online?there are currently 16 million teens and kids online, and this is expected to double by 2002, according to simmons market research. e-marketer research shows that 67 percent of the teens online have researched or bought products online. and jupiter communications estimates that teen net shopping will grow 19 fold and reach 1.2 billion by 2002.from major corporations like coca-cola, to teen catalogue retailers like delia's and alloy, businesses everywhere are jostling to tap into this e-commerce mother lode.to grab kids' attention, companies are trying to recreate what they love most: the great american mall.but statistics show that appealing to teen tastes doesn't necessarily work: teen sites aren't all that popular even with their target audience.teen retailers aim to generate sales by offering what teenagers list as their no. 1 activity on the net: communication. in a recent survey conducted by cheskin research, 74 percent described the internet as \"mainly an important connection to their friends.\"three major teen web sites, bolt media, delia's.com, and alloy online, combine commerce with community. they offer teen-oriented content areas like sports, entertainment, and relationships, along with such \"social interaction\" features as chatrooms, personal web pages, and email.\"you have to think of it as a mall,\" said alloy ceo matt diamond. \"without the community aspect, it's just a shop in the middle of the desert.\"the retail aspect \"pays the bills, but 95 percent of our traffic is community-based,\" diamond said. \"community and content aspects keep the kids coming back every day.\"the idea of driving sales through content is so appealing that traditional content-only sites like bolt.com are turning to e-commerce as a way to generate revenue. bolt recently introduced the bolt store, which sells such hot teen brands as roxy and fubu.but it's a strategy that may prove tricky in the long run.\"the danger is that the need [of chat-based sites] for a revenue-based model may alienate a lot of teens,\" said cheskin research's davis masten.it's ok to just sell to these kids, but you need to be upfront about it, he said.masten says that teens today are highly savvy about corporate marketing, and resent any attempt to manipulate their behavior. \"authenticity is a key aspect of teen communication,\" he said.\"bolt at least allows the kids to select the products that are sold on their site. so it's within their broader theme of allowing them to create their own social space,\" he said.the real problem with the popular commerce-and-content strategy is that it contradicts market research. masten doesn't think content is particularly important when it comes to selling to teens.\"you don't need to fool kids into buying. it's ok just to sell to them,\" said masten. \"it's more important to project a clear and authentic attitude.\"ekaterina walsh at forrester research is equally skeptical about the emphasis on content.\"it's simply an assumption that vendors are making. it [content] is absolutely unnecessary,\" said walsh.\"kids are not after games and chats when they buy. they're looking for things like value and customer service. if they want games they'll go to gamesville,\" she said.walsh points to the coke web site, which offers games, chat, and other teen-friendly features, as a typical example of a company that's wasted money on content.they've thrown so much money on their site, but the irony is that you can't even buy coke there, walsh said. \"no wonder they're not getting any traffic. they should be redirecting that revenue to buying banners.\"walsh's main point is that teen sites like alloy and bolt don't even register when you look at the entire teen traffic on the net. alloy may boast of one million unique visitors, but that's a drop in the bucket.studies conducted by forrester research and media metrix show that teenagers favor mainstream sites like yahoo, hotmail, amazon, and cdnow.in terms of a teen-oriented strategy, analysts are more enthusiastic about digital wallet sites, which offer adolescents what they crave most: freedom from parental supervision.companies like cybermoola, rocketcash inc, and icanbuy.com allow kids to buy online without their parents' credit cards. cybermoola, for example, offers a prepaid internet shopping card which kids can use to buy products from select vendors.teens represent the only significant market segment that doesn't have access to credit cards, points out cybermoola ceo eric freeman. and the $250 billion that kids spend in the \"dirt world\" means little as long as online transactions continue to rely on credit card transactions. right now, most teenagers make purchases on their parents' cards, which may explain why only 10 percent of them buy online.\"the cybermoola card allows them to convert their money into internet cash,\" said freeman.and digital wallet sites make parents happy as well.\"they're a good start because the parent is still in control,\" said walsh. \"they can set up an account rather than set their kids loose with a credit card.\"apart from freedom, teenagers also value choice. the future of sites like cybermoola is going to depend on their selection of merchant partners, said walsh.while the pundits may disagree about strategy, there is little doubt about the importance of capturing the teen market. getting these kids when they're young may be the key to keeping them as customers when they become adults.but these cyberkids may prove to be the most difficult customers that american business has encountered to date.unlike previous generations, \"they do believe there is something known as a free lunch,\" walsh said.\"they're used to getting everything for free \u2013- information, email, pcs. and they're beginning to expect that offline,\" she said, implying that this makes them less inclined to actually spend.in other words, the internet generation may easily turn the e-commerce dream into a marketing nightmare."}
