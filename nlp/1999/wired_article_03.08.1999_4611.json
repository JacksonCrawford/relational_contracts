[the privacy issue] is an unintended side effect.\"the unique number can be easily traced to a person by searching for the number in documents known to be created by that person, according to smith. unknown documents could also be associated with that person using the identification number.\"if you're in some really weird office-politics situation -- who knows?\" he said.he plans to explore whether other windows applications, such as software for creating web pages, use the id numbers. he's also interested in the behavior of the company's outlook email software.smith said users can easily find their own network address, then search their hard-disk content for documents containing the id number to determine where it is surreptitiously stored.users can find the number by selecting the run command under the windows start menu and typing winipcfg to launch the windows ip configuration utility. one of the fields appearing in the dialog box contains the user's \"network adapter\" address.\"all i did was have a search utility scan the hard disk for occurrences of the ethernet address,\" he said.smith used one called grep. \"anyone can do that and see how common it is.\""}
