larry ellison said that the overabundance of servers -- even at his billion-dollar database company-- has made the world too complex. in a 45-minute speech at fall internet world, filled with the usual abundance of sharp microsoft jabs, ellison made a plea for the end of client-server computing and dispersed databases, and a move to centralized web services.seductively low-priced pcs and servers have created a huge problem in the computing world, ellison said. because the hardware is so cheap, people everywhere have created complex database applications and made the \"terrible mistake\" of running them on desktops.\"we thought we were distributing power, but what we're distributing was complexity,\" he said.in the old days when a bug was discovered, people fixed it in the mainframe and then thousands of connected pcs were ok, he said. now, bugs get fixed in client-server programs and 10,000 to 20,000 desktop computers have to be updated. banks have put smaller database servers in every branch, and large retail chains have done the same thing, he said. even burger king has put individual servers in each store. according to ellison this is a colossal mistake.the worst problem, he said, is that when people fragment their data this way they have no idea what their company is doing as a whole.as an example, ellison used his own company. oracle has about 70 separate human-resources databases to keep track of its employees worldwide. so when ellison wants to know how many employees work at oracle, or in what country staffers have the highest average salary, he can\u2019t find out quickly.\"like, i don\u2019t know, ok?\" he said in mock valley girl tones. \"i\u2019m paying top dollar to not know what\u2019s going on. it\u2019s kinda funny.\"ten years ago, he said, people in the industry talked about the application backlog caused by the gridlock of developing for mainframes. today the big problem is the high-tech labor shortage.\"that either means there aren\u2019t enough workers, or the whole model of distributed complexity is wrong,\" said ellison.the answer, he said, is a new model of computing based around, you guessed it, the internet.\"everything is going to mirror the web. shared-data applications will go on shared servers, and not all over the place.\"he said oracle is reducing the number of databases it has -- for example, the 70 human-resources databases will be shrunk to one, and the company\u2019s 40 data centers around the world will be whittled down to two.it\u2019s basic economy-of-scale logic, he said, but for some reason it just hasn\u2019t been applied enough in the computing industry.ellison also had a special message for the developers in the room: stop developing programs for the windows platform.ellison said that microsoft has touted the development of windows 2000 as \"the most complex engineering project in the history of mankind.\"\"forget putting people on the moon\" he said. \"harnessing the atom? forget it!\"you can\u2019t make this stuff up,\" he chortled.instead of making the desktop more complicated, he said, the internet is proving that pcs should be simpler. with a browser, most people will be able to access the servers (and the data) they need.for the umpteenth time in a speech, ellison extolled the virtues of centralized computing, this time promoting net application servers as the nirvana of simple computing.instead of small businesses struggling to install windows 2000 and desktop applications for things like accounting or money management, people will be able to log on to a web service and get the work done online. oracle conveniently has lots of application partners running their servers that they can point consumers to.doctors won\u2019t have to choose between reading up on the latest cancer research or making sure their billing and client records are in the right kind of database. they\u2019ll just go to a hypothetical site -- like patientrecords.com -- without having to worry if they had compatible software installed, he said.ellison gave an indication as to how oracle will be adapting to a centralized net computing universe.he said next week oracle will announce a \"portal-to-go project\" called panama that will allow people to get all the applications they need from a cell phone or palm vii. he did not elaborate on the how, when, and where, however.the crowd giggled and applauded during the microsoft jabs and promises of a simpler tomorrow. during the question and answer period that followed, ellison was asked what would happen in the future to graphic artists and writers who need more of an individualized system and not a network-centric platform.\"individualists will be using macintoshes,\" he said.ellison's speech may have changed the tempo, but the \"anything but microsoft\" song remains the same."}
