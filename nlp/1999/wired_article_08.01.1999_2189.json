(by that time, eckert and mauchly had become fully involved with conceiving their next and most famous computer, univac.) eniac was decommissioned in 1955, by then a curious relic of technologies past.the technically minded will not find much real meat in this book. its discussions of the underlying technologies are quite simplistic. (little attention is paid to eniac's architecture, and the author doesn't seem to understand the critical difference between diode and triode vacuum tubes.) but the descriptions, such as they are, do provide the lay reader with enough of a sense of the basic technical issues to be able to follow the drama of eniac's creation.it is that drama which is the real story here. eckert once complained, \"i never did anything mean to [von neumann]; i don't know why he should do something mean to me.\" the cast of characters (famous and unknown), the contending egos, and the egregious acts of dishonesty and deceit make this book an absorbing read for anyone who savors the human stories that always underlie great events.<a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"externallink\",\"outgoingurl\":\"http://barnesandnoble.bfast.com/booklink/click?sourceid=383472&amp;is_search=y&amp;title=eniac%3a+the+triumphs+and+tragedies+of+the+world%27s+first+computer&amp;match=exact&amp;options=and\"}' href=\"http://barnesandnoble.bfast.com/booklink/click?sourceid=383472&amp;is_search=y&amp;title=eniac%3a+the+triumphs+and+tragedies+of+the+world%27s+first+computer&amp;match=exact&amp;options=and\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">eniac: the triumphs and tragedies of the world's first computer</a> by scott mccartney: $23. walker and company: +1 (212) 727 8300.street credbasement area networkhacking the vacuum tubefree of attachmentspolaroid's sticky portalburnt rubber, chicago stylebooting up beelzebubout of the celluloid closetreadmemusicsaar-sightedthe transreal thingi, nicklausamerican history f/xjust outta betalittle big screen\"it was just the law of large numbers at work\"contributors"}
