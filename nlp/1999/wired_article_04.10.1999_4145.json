york -- dance, the most physical of art forms, would seem to be the perfect medium in which to explore the problems of \"meatspace\" in an era of technology. the troika ranch dance company thinks so, anyway.\"since 1989, every piece we've done is about this,\" said mark coniglio, one of the artistic directors of the brooklyn-based group.troika ranch specializes in meshing new media with dance, and will perform a piece called \"vera's body\" 9 to 11 april at the joyce soho in new york. in it, the story of one woman's life -- and her connection to her body -- are explored.a composer by training, coniglio got hooked on technology as a teenager growing up in nebraska, where he landed his first computer programming job when he was 16.in troika productions, performers manipulate their theatrical environment with their movement and vocalization, which are tied to technologies coniglio develops. sensors on the stage or on the dancer's body transmit information about the performer's actions to a computer. coniglio wrote software that interprets the data and lets the performer control of several types of media, including music synthesizers, theatrical lighting, digital audio effects, video, and robotic set pieces.in \"vera's body,\" a set of laser pointers flash four beams from the ceiling to the floor. a dancer's movements through the beams trigger musical notes, making the beams like interactive guitar strings the dancer plucks with her body.\"we act as conductors of the media,\" said dawn stoppiello, a choreographer/dancer and coniglio's wife.the two met as students at california institute of the arts near los angeles. last halloween they married in mexico.\"this piece reflects the dialectic between dawn and [me],\" coniglio said after a recent run-through of \"vera's body.\"\"i'm not comfortable with my body. i'm in my head. i'm a computer person,\" he said. \"dawn is in her body, more than she is in her head.\" on their web site, coniglio and stoppiello stress that \"the ability for a performer to use [his or her] instincts to determine the timing and dynamics of the sound, light, and image is of the utmost importance.\"in the midst of a harried and increasingly digital world, the connection to the self and the earth are also key.at one point in \"vera's body,\" a woman dances with a tiny, spy-sized camera in her palm. she holds the camera above her face, broadcasting a close-up image of herself to the screen behind her.troika ranch also uses the mididancer, an interactive costume coniglio created. midi, or musical instrument digital interface, uses sensors, a microcomputer, and a radio transmitter that measure and respond to a dancer's movement.in this piece, the mididancer is inside the chest of a full-sized paper body that the dancers move, dance, and interact with. when a dancer squeezes the body's chest, the mididancer triggers prerecorded sound samples, which play differently depending on how hard the chest is squeezed.the technology, said dancer lisa herlinger, is \"another element that's beyond just yourself. you use it as something to react to -- to take initiative from. so, it's sort of like each performance is an improv.\"working with the technology \"allows you to look at dance in a different way,\" she said. \"some people like it, and some people don't .... in the end, the dance is more important than the technology.\"at another point, a dancer with a microphone controls with her breath what images the audience sees on the screen. rosemarie hegenbart, who dances with the microphone device, said the technology \"allows you to be whimsical.\"troika ranch has been funded several times by at&t's new experiments in art and technology program.last month, the troupe began working on a new media opera, \"the chemical wedding of christian rosenkreutz.\" based on a 15th-century book, the story is an allegorical tale of a wedding in which the bride and groom are joined through a mysterious alchemical process. they plan to use the story's symbolism as a basis for exploring the narrative's deeper context, namely: what does it take to experience radical transformation of the soul?troika ranch has given workshops on new media to performers around the country, including at the international dance and technology conference, which was held in february at arizona state university.troika has also created a web-based resource on the use of interactive technology in dance and other live performance.coniglio dreams of creating a software tool that will make it easier for other performers to incorporate technology into their craft.\"i want other people to be able to do this, to create interactive performances. this (technology) forces you into computer-think, and dancers don't think in that linear way,\" he said."}
