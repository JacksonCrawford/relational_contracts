[of the disabled],\" said judy brewer, director of the consortium's accessibility initiative.but for some web designers and technologists, the rules will come with a whole new set of problems.\"of course, i believe that handicapped people should have full access to the web,\" said oz lubling, a technologist at web design and consulting firm razorfish.\"but technology and new computer languages, like xml, are emerging so quickly now that a more useful approach would be to work with and adapt the new technology to enable the users, rather than restrict the old technology, which seems disabling,\" he said.lubling said that the cost of reverse-engineering existing web sites could be prohibitive, and maybe even cause sites that can't afford the expense to shut down.\"the bottom line is that in general, designers are not going to be happy with any mandated restrictions,\" he said.kari friedman, an engineer at the web design firm organic agrees that the cost of these changes could be exorbitant.\"i would suspect it would raise costs at least twice as much,\" friedman said.so will this have a chilling effect on web design in the future? \"i don't really think so,\" said drue miller, the creative director of vivid studios, a web design company that already incorporates a lot of the wc3's recommended specifications.\"of course, there will always be designers who want to be on the bleeding edge -- and thus, exclude 90 percent of the audience out there. then there are those who want to be all-inclusive. maybe this will bring about a kind of happier medium,\" miller said.editor's note: this story has been corrected. the original article incorrectly stated that web sites operated by government contractors would be held to the pending rules. further, the story misstated a w3c guideline concerning the use of multiple languages on one page. wired news regrets the errors."}
