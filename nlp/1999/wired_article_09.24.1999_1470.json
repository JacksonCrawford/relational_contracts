meanwhile, the world population is getting older and not replacing itself,\" said sanborn. \"let's face it, people have been talking about the polar ice caps melting for 20 years. yet they're actually getting bigger.\"stopp argues that global food production is outstripping demand, pointing to statistics cited in population, food, and nutrition, a 1997 book from the population reference bureau in washington, d.c. which argues that, \"over the past 40 years, the world's food supply has expanded faster than the population.\"stopp believes abortions and family planning services such as planned parenthood and in-school sex education programs are to blame for the declining populations, and hopes to \"cause such discontent with planned parenthood programs that it will have no choice but to close its doors and get out of town,\" according to the mission statement on the organization's web site.\"this country has lost at least 40 million children to abortions,\" said sanborn. \"that's leading to the population growing older, which will lead to a decrease in the available workforce and have catastrophic effects in the long term.\"most researchers believe that increasing world population compounds the problem. while he acknowledges that population growth in developed countries is slowing and, in some cases, turning around, pimentel points out that 98 percent of future population growth is expected to take place in third world countries.and pimentel argues that, even if an enforced limit of 2.1 children per couple were established worldwide tomorrow (a solution he doesn't advocate), the world population will still reach 12 billion within seventy years due to the predominantly young age structure of today's world population.\"as we add more people to the planet, we take more land out of agricultural usage because it's switched over to residences and shopping malls and such,\" said jay keller, national field director for zero population growth, based in washington, d.c. \"we're asking decreasing amounts of land to produce increasing amounts of food.\"and while new agricultural technologies can help, keller said they shouldn't be used as a crutch. \"even pessimists admit that technology will help [to feed the expanding population] -- but to put all our hopes in that one basket is pretty risky when you're betting human lives on it\"."}
