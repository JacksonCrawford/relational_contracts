[the] image is totally linked to the sound, there is a great rhythm to it.\"this colorful computer experimentation of the '60s paralleled the technological optimism then espoused by marshall mcluhan and others, as well as the artist's own belief in video as a radical new means of communication.historically, the undisputed highlight of the show is nam june paik's own \"global groove\" from 1973, with its blend of cultural fragments: poet alan ginsberg playing cymbals, composer john cage musing on the inevitability of sounds within silence, tap dancers stepping to a lively soundtrack of rock and jazz.the video culminates in a duet between traditional cellist alan schulman, and video performer/cellist charlotte moorman, who performs on a instrument constructed out of three video screens, each screen showing a portrait of schulman playing. as moorman strokes her electronic cello, she produces soft, stuttering electronic sounds that blend unexpectedly well with schulman's gentle harmonies.given video's origin in radio, and paik's background in music (he studied experimental german music in the 1950s), this musical focus is no surprise. but paik's film is also important in its anticipation of -- and antipathy toward -- television as a cultural force, what iles calls \"paik's prescient perception [of] television's unprecedented influence on everyone.\"two other installments offer intriguing glimpses of the medium's potential in the digital '90s.seoungho cho's short collage smoothly combines recognizable urban images (doors, cars, an anonymous figure in topcoat and briefcase) in a visually glossy, even glittering, study of light and movement in the city. these themes of urban anonymity, and the speed of modern life, are intensified by a nearly inaudible buzzing soundtrack. alongside kristin lucas's disjointed discourse on the bewildering mechanization of daily life, cho's work suggests that the new video art offers more than a simple visual/aural reflection of contemporary culture: it is resonant with genuine -- and potent -- cultural insight.the whitney-intel collaboration raises provocative questions about the place of video in the history of contemporary art.\"why video art? i mean, why make it? you can't sell it. it's pretty damn hard to collect,\" said video artist sarah smiley.intel's show represents a sea change: increasingly, videos are popping up in galleries and museum surveys, and being discovered by a noticeably larger and more deeply engaged audience.as for video's historic place, chrissie iles argues convincingly that from the start video was engaged with the same perceptual issues that absorbed leading artists, particularly sculptors, in the '70s and '80s, like the shifting boundaries between private and public space, and new relationships between the artist, his work, and his audience.curiously, it is art's new, enthusiastic patron, intel, that seems to be driving this study of video: iles credits the corporation with the idea for this mini-show, noting they were \"excellent\" and \"forward-looking\" to work with.this being a technology museum, the four pristine videos are juxtaposed with displays showing the development of some of the technology that made such artworks possible.in addition, intel's interest in art and technology is seen in two adjacent displays on the computer-aided completion of the \"sagrada familia,\" the famed, unfinished basilica in barcelona designed by antonio gaud\u00ed, and the restoration of a beloved bronze sculpture by benvenuto cellini currently taking place in florence.the pairing of intel, a creator of new media, and the whitney, one of the first museums to embrace such media and incorporate it regularly into artistic exhibitions, is surely inspired.having previously supported exhibits on virtual reality at the guggenheim, and on digital art at ucla, intel is currently sponsoring the whitney's major survey of the icons of american art, \"the american century\" -- to the tune of us$6 million. the company's support of that show includes an extensive online exhibition.in march 2000, an additional four videos by artists jud yalkut, steina, peter campus, and gary hill will replace the original films in santa clara \u00ad- and raise new and intriguing questions about video art.meanwhile, these four small pieces of contemporary art reveal video to be a vibrant part of contemporary art as well as life, while suggesting that today's technological corporations are one effective way to support it."}
