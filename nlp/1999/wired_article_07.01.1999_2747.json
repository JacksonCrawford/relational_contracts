and growing fast. __wired: the gates foundation bankroll has gotten so big that by law you have to give away more than $250 million this year. where's the cash going?gates: philanthropy is all about making being at the bottom of the economic pile less painful. we have a fairly big portfolio of world-health and education grants. we also spend quite a bit of money in the pacific northwest.what grants are you most proud of?we feel really good about the overseas educational work that johns hopkins is doing in the family-planning area and also an outfit that's trying to find a vaccine for aids.you have given $128 million to educational programs. what helps most?a lot of our money goes to k-12. the working world of tomorrow needs young people who know how to use technology - it's as fundamental as learning how to read and write. the internet and distance learning is almost certainly a more effective way of teaching than what we've been doing.is the public education system broken?not as badly as most people think. there are very entrepreneurial, very promising principles being brought to bear in education, such as financially rewarding schools for strong test scores.most of your giving is focused on washington state. are you building seattle into the future capital of the pacific rim?there's no grand vision. we've given money to children's hospitals, to a new symphony hall, to goodwill industries for a forklift. it's a pretty broad array. this is the community in which we grew up and my son prospered, his company prospered. we want it to be as healthy as it can be.you have made some unexpected gifts too, such as one to girls incorporated of sioux city, iowa.well, every once in a while you just do something that feels good. girls inc. has to do with the fact that gateway is near there. ted waitt and my son are good friends.so, can i send you a proposal for my pet project?we don't accept unsolicited proposals. we have a list of charitable organizations that we've worked with. we turn down somewhere in the neighborhood of 90 percent of outside requests.how hands-on is your son?one of trey's specific concerns is that the foundations not become so large that he'll have to spend a lot more time with them. he and melinda basically sit in a review situation. every two or three months, we send over an assortment of things, and they typically get them back to us very, very promptly.accepted wisdom says money can't really make a difference.absolutely unquestionably it can. if something really happens in the area of vaccines for children, it will be because of philanthropic dollars and united nations money. without that aid, we'd still have smallpox and huge polio problems. philanthropy has made a huge difference in the world birthrate, though this challenge has not been completely met by any means.what gives you most cause for hope?the spread of education. god knows, an educated citizenry is not necessarily a formula for happy times, but i have a simplistic belief that it is a way to create a more just and richer society.what's technology's role?there are people who argue that technology is the equivalent of capital. and a person being able to turn on a pc and find out anything he wants to know is a form of capital that is going to help equalize things. it certainly is a possible truth.what's the difference between today's young entrepreneurs and businesspeople who gave money in your generation?i didn't know anybody who was 35 and had a million - or several million - dollars. it is flat out a new ballgame.should they be sharing more of the wealth?what many people lose sight of is that the net worth of these ultrawealthy young people is tied up in company stock. you also can't expect that much from people who are building their first house and don't even have kids in college yet. by and large, the fruits of that accumulation will be felt 15, 20 years from now.what's the best way to start giving?any serious giver should start off by making a contribution to the general health and human services area - it's exceedingly rational to give to a large pot where well-informed people spread it around. i have reservations about charitable activity that is completely devoted to some esoteric personal inclination.what about volunteering time?people who have discretionary funds need to see the service-delivery end - counseling, giving assistance in shelters, getting involved wherever there's direct contact. they have something to give personally, and it rubs both ways.you had contact, as a corporate attorney, with the delivery end of antitrust law. was the breakup of at&t, for example, a good thing?the change in telecommunications is a true historic phenomenon. and you ask yourself if that would have happened without the at&t breakup. i suspect it contributed.amid today's merger mania, are companies setting themselves up for future regulation?before, competition all involved the use of copper wire. now, with tv cables under everybody's sidewalk and satellites hovering around the earth, there are at least two other very good ways to deliver information and even video, for heaven's sake.what's given you your greatest pleasure in life?my children.what tech tools are essential to your arsenal?my toshiba laptop. it's seldom that a whole day goes by without my checking email. i have a cell phone, pager, and all those gadgets, too, but i don't consider them indispensable.what invention would you like to see most?there are vaccines that i pray for - for malaria and aids. on the personal side, i think it would be fun to have a really automated, electronic home. i enjoy being at my son's place.what kind of response do you get when you answer the phone, \"hello, this is bill gates\"?there was a time when i was introduced to people and they'd say, \"oh, sure, and i'm minnie mouse!\" if trey and i could rewrite history, we would change our names."}
