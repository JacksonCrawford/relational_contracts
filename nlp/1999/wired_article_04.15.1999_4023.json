don't bet on it.\"i think the nasdaq can go about 100 points lower,\" said peter green, technical strategist at gruntal & co., quickly crunching the numbers on his computer. \"there's a 15 percent correction in store for the nasdaq, and about half that for the dow.\"but he cautions investors not to get too caught up in short-term market fluctuations. \"it's a long-term story,\" green emphasized. \"technology is going to be around for a long time, and the long-term story's intact.\"could be. traders have been leery about the tech camp since compaq computer scared the bejesus out of everyone with an out-of-left-field profit warning. but since then, intel has come through with impressive earnings, and now advanced micro devices (amd) is up us$1.63 at $16.38 after posting a smaller-than-expected loss for the latest quarter. granted, expectations were sharply diminished as the chipmaker issued no fewer than three separate profit warnings in recent months, but, like they say, any port in a storm.similarly, apple computer (aapl) once again has blown past estimates with quarterly income of 60 cents a diluted share, riding tall in the saddle as consumers keep snapping up those candy-colored imacs. the company's shares inched up 22 cents to $35.75.gruntal's green, for one, wonders if the love affair with the imac isn't just a passing fancy, like any other fashion trend. \"it's a product that people like,\" he said. \"businesses might not like it, but it sure looks good beside my architectural digest coffee table.\"like apple, charles schwab (sch) dropped 11 percent to $122.75 even as it said first-quarter profit more than doubled to 34 cents a share, slightly ahead of estimates. online brokers have risen so far, so fast in recent days that it's hardly surprising traders would seize on a solid earnings report as a decent excuse to pocket some winnings.the same goes for ameritrade (amtd), which fell $11.38 to $136.63 after reporting quarterly income of 14 cents a share, or double the anticipated amount. etrade group (egrp), which is slated to announce its own earnings next week, shed 10 percent to $101.44.delia's (dlia), the purveyor of teen togs that has refashioned itself as an e-commerce dynamo, plunged 27 percent to $22.50 after warning that sagging sales at its screem! chain of clothing stores will result in a first-quarter operating loss, and may hammer the company's full-year bottom line.considering that delia's saw its iturf online unit more than double in value on its first trading day last week, it must be a drag to have the real world crash the party and spoil all the fun.internet access provider earthlink (elnk) declined 10 percent to $73 as it posted a quarterly loss of 15 cents a share. although the setback wasn't as bad as feared, earthlink's number of new subscribers was down from the previous quarter, and this spooked traders.aspect telecommunications (aspt), which makes software for routing phone calls, fell 69 cents to $6.31 after reporting a first-quarter loss of 19 cents a share, almost twice the expected amount. and telecom equipment maker qualcomm (qcom) shed 19 cents to $157.75 even as it declared a two-for-one stock split.on the other hand, they were having some fun over in the toy aisle. mattel (mat) climbed 8.9 percent to $28.25 as it announced plans to spend about $50 million forming an internet subsidiary, part of which may be sold to the public. oh, and the company will sack more than 3,000 workers and close a bunch of plants.hasbro (has), meanwhile, advanced 6.2 percent to $32 as it topped estimates with quarterly profit of 7 cents a share. much of those gains stem from the company's acquisition of tiger electronics, which makes furbys, which, for reasons that escape this column, continue to sell like, well, furbys. hasbro also can look forward to booming demand for its star wars action figures.lastly, gibson greetings (gibg), the third-largest greeting card company, nose-dived 37 percent to $6.31 after warning that weak sales may result in a first-quarter loss of as much as 25 cents a share. profit of 36 cents had been expected.a get-well-soon card wouldn't be inappropriate here."}
