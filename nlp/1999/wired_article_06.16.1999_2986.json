constantly besieged by new technologies, the former head of symantec corporation testified on wednesday. gordon eubanks, who is now the ceo of oblix, held up a 3com palmpilot and showed it to the judge overseeing the microsoft antitrust trial.\"i don't know if your honor has ever used a palmpilot,\" he said. \"you get addicted and you keep upgrading.\"eubanks said technologies like handheld pcs and open-source development could dislodge microsoft from its commanding position in the pc industry, and said that dismissing linux as a non-threat would be \"like discounting windows in 1985.\"\"i'm hearing customers talk about it all the time,\" eubanks said.in an attempt to rebut government claims, a microsoft attorney asked eubanks to compare technical support offered to developers by both microsoft and apple computer. symantec develops utility software, such as norton utilities and norton antivirus, for both platforms.eubanks had few kind things to say about developing software for apple. \"it's like shaking hands with an octopus. you don't know where to start and you have to watch your back when you're doing it.\"eubanks, who was called to testify on behalf of microsoft, repeatedly characterized the software industry as fast-moving and highly competitive, saying that he knows firsthand how a leading firm can make embarrassing missteps.\"we had a dominant position in '93,\" he said, but mcafee, a rival manufacturer of antivirus software, quickly overtook symantec. eubanks said in not paying attention to the rapid changes, he made \"a big mistake.\"he said the history of the computer industry is a history of important \"inflection points,\" at which time the market adopts new technologies: from cp/m to dos, from dos to windows, from pcs to the internet.eubanks dismissed earlier testimony by government witness david farber, a university of pennsylvania professor. farber said that microsoft's internet explorer browser was not truly part of the windows operating system, a key argument in the justice department's case.\"he can define an operating system in whichever way he chooses,\" eubanks said. \"but let's get real.... when a consumer wants an operating system, they want it to be turnkey.\"while he began his day with a spirited defense of the the microsoft, by day's end eubanks conceded that microsoft was a \"natural monopoly\" that picked out a few firms for special privilege -- including symantec.\"we have a tremendous infrastructure that works closely with microsoft,\" eubanks had said in a 1997 interview, when he was ceo of symantec. eubanks said in the interview that microsoft \"can't have relationships with many different companies. that's the kind of stuff that is a huge barrier to our competition.\"under cross examination from government lawyer david boies -- and with the introduction into evidence of a contract detailing the special considerations granted to symantec -- eubanks confirmed that his former firm had gotten a significant boost from microsoft.microsoft gave symantec early copies of its latest programs, enabling symantec to get a leg up on competitors, said eubanks.but its contract specified that symantec would give preference to microsoft's internet explorer to the exclusion of other browsers.eubanks testified that symantec was careful to avoid criticism of microsoft, and said that on a half-dozen occasions, at microsoft's request, he gave interviews defending microsoft's position in its current antitrust trial.eubanks was the second of three microsoft rebuttal witnesses as the trial, now in its 72nd day, winds down. after his testimony was finished, the trial adjourned until monday.asked by a microsoft lawyer if the firm's personal computer operating system was a \"natural monopoly,\" eubanks replied: \"windows is an example of that.\"monopolies obtained by luck or skill are legal as long as they are not abused. the justice department and 19 states allege that microsoft abused its monopoly position in personal computer operating systems to continue that monopoly and gain advantage in other business areas such as internet browsers.microsoft chairman bill gates was in washington on wednesday with basketball star shaquille o'neal to promote a program encouraging children to safely surf the internet.\"what microsoft has done in terms of making windows better for use on the internet is a fantastic thing,\" gates said at the event. \"i'm surprised we have to defend that at all. what we do is great, the competition is great. this is an industry that works very well.\"at the trial, a new filing by the us justice department showed gates praising an internal memo, leaked to some reporters in december, as a useful public relations device.the justice department introduced an email in which gates questioned a company spokesman on why he had restricted media distribution of his 1 december 1998 memo to executive staff.the memo provided an answer to the government's allegation that microsoft gave away its internet explorer web browser to compete unfairly against netscape navigator.\"i am really surprised we restricted the distribution of this so much,\" gates complained in an email to greg shaw, a microsoft public relations official. \"my comments are the best tool we have to shift the dialog and get people to understand who gave consumers the fair price for browsing.\"shaw replied in another email that the restricted distribution would provide more media interest than issuing a news release.a microsoft spokesman dismissed the memos as a \"sideshow.\" reuters contributed to this report."}
