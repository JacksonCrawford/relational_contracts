you'd better: the mplayer3 comes sans built-in memory. while this scheme sounds a little impractical, pontis is banking on forthcoming 128-meg cards to make this player sing.__ mplayer3: $195; www.mplayer3.com. ____ saehan ____ mp-f10 __the korean electronics company takes the prize for getting the most complete line of mp3 players to market first. the mp-f10 is the entry-level bad boy, featuring 32 megs of ram, expandable to 64.__ mp-f10: $179; www.mpman.com. ____ saehan ____ mp-f20 __the mp-f20 uses flash cards and 32 megs of built-in memory to provide 60 minutes of cd-quality music. unlike the mp-f10, this tune toter includes a parallel port, freeing you from the docking station once and for all.__ mp-f20: $179; www.mpman.com. ____ saehan ____ mp-f30 __the latest saehan player has more memory than the other ram-based players - up to 128 megs - so you can take it on a 10k run and then some: it holds two hours of cd-quality music. it also comes with remote-control headphones and an electronic memo feature for phone numbers or notes.__ mp-f30: price not available; www.mpman.com. ____ empeg ____ empeg car __the empeg car sits on your dash and holds up to 5,000 mp3 songs (or 35 hours of music) in a 2.1-gig hard drive. this removable auto stereo includes an infrared remote, usb and serial ports for transferring music files, and four pre-outs for your in-car amplifier. it's decidedly geek chic.__ empegcar: $999; www.empeg.com. ____ saehan ____ mp-cl10 __the mp-cl10 underscores yet again the unresolved issue of removable media. instead of flash cards, this player uses 40-meg clik! disks to store tunes. the advantage? well, if you have a clik! drive it's pretty handy. otherwise, it's yet another removable media to bother with. available late 1999.__ mp-cl10: price not available; www.mpman.com. ____ samsung ____ yepp e series __yup, the yepp is cool - although you might consider spending the extra money for the b or d series instead of buying this entry-level model. while it does offer the basics in terms of memory and appearance - as well as a direct parallel port connection to a pc - you're missing out on the sexy magnesium case (see yepp b and d). available late 1999.__ yepp e series: approximately $200; yepp.co.kr. ____ samsung ____ yepp b series __yepp b has that cool magnesium look, but why it requires a docking station (while the e series doesn't) remains a mystery. and, like the e series, it offers a paltry 32 megs of built-in memory with no means for expansion. available late 1999.__ yepp b series: approximately $225; yepp.co.kr. ____ samsung ____ yepp d series __yepp d is what you're looking for: magnesium shell and 32 megs of ram, with flash memory cards for an added 32 megs. and samsung throws in a digital fm tuner for good measure. available late 1999.__ yepp d series: approximately $250; yepp.co.kr. ____ wired global communications ____ cd^3 __hands down, the strangest mp3 initiative. this open-source project was started by five students at the devry institute of technology in phoenix. instead of storing mp3s in ram, you use a cd burner to store mp3 files on a cd and then play the cd on the cd^3. that way, you can carry around 200-plus songs on this portable cd mp3 player. prototype built, awaiting hardware manufacturer.__ cd^3: approximately $399; cd3.wiredglobal.com. ____ baycom gmbh ____ oscar __a home-stereo component of sorts, this mp3 player is most definitely not portable. instead, it features a hefty hard drive. you compress music files with a pc and then transfer these mp3s to oscar's massive hard disk. the advantage is that it stores 2,500 songs (six days' worth of music), so you never have to get off the couch. limited availability.__ oscar: $410; www.oscar-mp3.com. ____ lydstr\u00f8m ____ songbank mz3-3500 __of all the would-be mp3 stereo components, the songbank mz3-3500 seems the most likely to find a place in your living room. like others, it has a cd player that stores songs and supports mp3 files. but unlike the competition, its hard disk holds a whopping 3,500 songs. what's more, lydstr\u00f8m seems intent on taking the geek out of the mp3 experience by including a simple touchscreen remote, an interface that automatically recognizes and labels tracks, and an intelligent agent that learns your listening habits and can play the songs you want when you want to hear them. available late 1999.__ songbank mz3-3500: $1,000; www.lydstrom.com. ____ indigita ____ rav6 digital audio jukebox __basically, the rav6 digital audio jukebox is a dds dat backup system that has been retrofitted to handle mp3 files. this means it can hold 2,000 near-cd-quality songs and play them back on demand. mp3.com uses this system in-house to store up to 2,000 songs.__ rav6 digital audio jukebox: $599; www.indigita.com. __"}
