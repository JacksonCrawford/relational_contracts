"text": "new york \u00ad- will one standard triumph in the exploding digital music field? depends who you ask. bob ponce, president of the world wide web artists consortium who moderated a \"digital music showdown\" thursday at the new york software industry association's tech summit has firm views on the subject.after listening to heavyweights from mp3.com, liquid audio, a2b and a consultant for the recording industry of america association hotly debate the topic, ponce spoke with wired news about digital music downloads. he predicts one standard for digital music will emerge, but says hardware manufacturers will have to get in on the game first.\"for my mother to use mp3 it's got to be something like a cd,\" ponce said.the popular mp3 format compresses near-cd quality music files that can be transmitted over the internet and played on pcs. mp3.com is a commercial web site with more than 10,000 digital music files available to download.the riaa has been up in arms about mp3, saying it's contributing to the pirating of music and a loss of profits to artists and record labels. but ponce and michael robertson, president of mp3.com and one of the panelists, said artists are already losing plenty of their profits \u00ad- to the industry.\"there are a lot of artists that just aren't getting paid,\" ponce said. he said artists who sell a half-million copies of a cd (which equates to roughly us$5 million in sales) still get dropped by their record labels. artists generally get about 10 cents on a dollar when a regular cd is sold, ponce said, and even then the record companies make performers wait to collect the money.\"that's ludicrous,\" ponce said. the combination of new technology and new business models being pushed by companies like mp3.com, he said, is forcing a change in the music industry.mp3.com lets artists sign up to have their music distributed on the internet and then splits the money from sales 50-50 with the musicians. \"if they (artists) get 50 percent of 100,000 copies sold for maybe a little less than an average cd -- say $10 -- that's a half-million for the artist on the net,\" ponce said. artists who already have generated a buzz just need a delivery system, he said, and mp3.com is providing that.but player hardware has to hit the market in a big way before online music becomes more than just a \"geek thing,\" ponce said. \"at the end of the day, i want to take my music with me.\"cd is the format of choice. mp3 won't replace the cd, but [will] be part of a new hybrid form. so you can have a rio [mp3 player] that's a cd, too.\"liquid audio, a2b, and others are competing to provide secure digital download formats of music that are based on proprietary technology. the riaa recently said it was creating its own a secure format, the secure digital music initiative.the issue of a single standard was one of the most hotly debated by the panel. ponce asked if more than one format can survive. howard singer, chief technology officer for a2b said yes, but agreed that as more hardware audio formats come out \"it will be a big question.\"\"the algorithms for compression and decompression are easy, but security is harder,\" he said.nick digiacomo, vice president of electronic markets at scient and an sdmi consultant to the riaa, said while more than one standard can exist, the more important question is one of security.while \"end-to-end systems don't need to be interoperable, the security needs to be,\" digiacomo said, adding that it's too late to dictate a standard, so the riaa is \"just trying to get interoperability on the conditions of purchase.\"he said sdmi has already had an impact on the market, pointing to the $11 million that mp3.com recently raised in venture capital. singer agreed. \"we need a system that propagates rules,\" he said. he and others said some methods of the payment for music could change in the future, such as allowing fans to download music if they'll give their name and email address to the artist in exchange. but robertson, like ponce, said only one format for digital music can triumph. \"that's what works on the net: open, international standards.\"robertson said the whole debate has become framed as a morality question. \"it's become un-american to argue against security,\" he said, \"but five companies sell 87 percent of the music. they'll say anything to protect their position.\"he said restricting how people can use content is unrealistic. \"all this talk of security is nonsense,\" robertson said to applause. \"the oligarchy is circling the wagons.\"mp3.com, he said, will work to give artists even greater control over their music.whereas artists now see a cut of their profits eaten up by the record labels and others who control the publication, broadcast, and performance rights to their music, robertson said that will change. \"we're working on facilitating all of that for the artists,\" robertson said.among the plans he hinted at: artists will be able to call up a map of the world showing them where their fans are most heavily concentrated. that will help them figure out where they can most successfully tour, robertson said."}
