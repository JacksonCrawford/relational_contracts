(ehhi).ehhi is a nonprofit organization made up of doctors, public health professionals and policy experts dedicated to protecting public health from environmental harm. the group has released a list of 12 areas where schools should take particular care to protect children.one common group of pollutants to which children may be exposed is pesticides. ehhi recommends that schools avoid treating any outside grounds and fields where children play. if pesticides must be used inside or outside, the group says the school should select the least toxic product available, and give parents and students advance notice of chemical applications.washington public schools chief facilities officer kifah jayyousi told ens that schools in the nation\u2019s capitol take pesticide management a step farther. \"we take very, very attentive precautions before we introduce these products into the schools,\" says jayyousi.\"our approach in pest control is integrated pest management,\" he says. \"we focus on preventive versus reactive introduction of chemicals. we try our best to make sure that there\u2019s a program in the schools to make sure that all pests are controlled at all times.\"by working to prevent pests from entering schools or school grounds, jayyousi says d.c. schools can reduce the amount and toxicity of chemicals needed to control them.pesticides, cleaning products and other chemicals should never be applied while children are present, ehhi says, and all products should be the least toxic available. in district of columbia schools, officials monitor the types of chemicals used in its schools, and makes sure that any chemical applications are done in a manner and at a time when they will not affect students or staff.\"you can not introduce these things in a classroom when kids are in the classroom,\" says jayyousi.d.c. schools have larger problems with some of the other environmental pollutants that ehhi warns against, particularly those associated with older buildings.\"our buildings are 65 years old on average,\" says jayyousi. \"we have 33 buildings built in the 1800s, and more than 50 percent were built prior to 1930. we always try our best to keep them in the best shape possible.\" older buildings, particularly in urban settings, often contain hazardous materials, including lead in paint and pipes, asbestos insulation, and toxic ballast in light fixtures. washington works to keep these materials from becoming health hazards by surveying all schools and testing before performing any maintenance or construction.\"our job is no. 1 to know where these hazards are, and we have done that,\" jayyousi says. d.c. has draft asbestos management plans in place for all its schools, and is working with the us environmental protection agency to ensure strict compliance with all federal and state regulations. many schools were cleared of asbestos this summer while children and staff were on vacation, though regulations did not require washington to take action.\"all of these environmental regulations we have to comply with -- you cannot comply with it in a passive manner,\" jayyousi says.the washington public schools are currently developing comprehensive guidelines for dealing with two more problems identified by ehhi -- carpets and playgrounds. some new carpeting can release toxic formaldehyde, while playground equipment and picnic benches made from chemically treated wood can release arsenic.jayyousi says d.c. schools plan to deal only with manufacturers for all new carpet installation and maintenance, to ensure that school carpets are top quality and the safest available. playgrounds are a more difficult issue, as many d.c. communities have approached the schools about purchasing and setting up their own playgrounds.to ensure that new school and community playgrounds are safe, d.c. schools are working with community leaders to develop safe specifications for materials and structures.this summer, d.c. public schools dismantled several playgrounds that they rated unsafe for the students due to problems with toxic materials or broken equipment. these playgrounds will be replaced with new equipment that complies with the strictest standards, jayyousi says.not just playgrounds could be closed over environmental concerns, he says. this year, officials shut down a middle school where a potential asbestos problem had been found. the entire school was moved to a renovated area where environmental issues had already been addressed.\"i will not hesitate to close a school if i thought the facility was unsafe for the children,\" says jayyousi.if problems are found in schools, d.c. has plans in place to deal with most emergencies. if tests show high lead content in school water, for example, the school immediately brings in bottled water and isolates the school\u2019s water supply until the problem can be corrected. if there is chemical spill in a science room, d.c. responds with a hazardous management team.\"we will not compromise when it comes to our children\u2019s safety,\" says jayyousi. \"we definitely take a proactive approach in protecting both students and staff.\"copyright
