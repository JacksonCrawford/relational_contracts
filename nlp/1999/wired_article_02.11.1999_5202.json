reversed course thursday and rushed to embrace all things .com. sure, they might gripe about sky-high valuations, but if there's one thing traders fear even more than being burned by bloated internet shares, it's missing out on the action when (or if) these suckers finally pay off.the broader market posted impressive gains. the dow jones industrial average rose 186.15 points to close at 9363.46, and the nasdaq composite index was up 95.99, or 4.16 percent, at 2405.49 -- the biggest one-day point gain ever. the s&p 500 advanced 30.48 to 1254.03.fed chief alan greenspan made an appearance on

confidence to focus once more on tech and net stocks, and wednesday's bargain hunting gave way to a full-on-the-lips buying spree.\"these stocks have gotten the crap beaten out of them,\" said jeff

shareholders took heart that the portal's biggest investor, venture-fund outfit cmgi, said it won't vote for usa networks' takeover of the company unless the terms of the deal are renegotiated to place a considerably higher premium on the stock's value. the current deal includes a scant 2 percent premium -- absurdly low for a top internet firm, shareholders believe.\"short-term, people were into the stock for a take-out,\" said goverman. \"long-term, the merger remains an open book. lycos knows it has to get bigger and become more of a media company.\"that now may or may not happen with
