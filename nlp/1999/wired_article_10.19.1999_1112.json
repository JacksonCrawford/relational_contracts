caskets on the internet. web suppliers are tossing around words like \"collusion\" and \"antitrust.\" by craig bicknell.", "author": "craig bicknell", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "10.19.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "pat lane is a funeral director, and he's not afraid of death. but changes in the death-care industry ... now, that's a different story. the chill winds of change are blowing through delano, the small central-california farm town where lane does business. those winds are blowing through fresno, too, and sacramento, and on eastward through the heartland to the big cities on the atlantic. they're blowing everywhere.\"customers that buy caskets on the internet,\" lane says with a mix of fear and anger, \"it's not the smartest thing for a customer to do, but they do it. they do it. it's where our biggest hit comes from.\"at funeral homes like lane's, caskets carry the corpses and the cash -- sometimes selling for five times the cost and bringing in up to half the profit. grieving people don't haggle.but if they go online, they can find a casket at a fraction of the cost. increasingly, that's just what they're doing.\"as more and more seniors are becoming computer literate, it's taking off,\" said lisa carlson, executive director of the funeral consumers alliance, a nonprofit organization that monitors the funeral industry.baby boomers are already online in droves, often planning for elderly parents' funerals, and, increasingly, their own.on the web, they find something totally foreign to the traditional death care industry -- consumer information. price comparisons abound, anathema to an industry that has thrived in a death-denying culture where people pay the asking price at the local funeral home and rush for the door.\"it only costs $25 more to build a sealer casket, but funeral homes typically charge $1,000 - $1,200 more for one,\" said lamar hankins, funeral consumers alliance board president. \"once people get better educated, they'll realize it's silly to pay that. all you're going to do is bury it in the ground. if you have an educated consumer, you have a much lower chance of being gouged by the industry.\"in the last three years, hundreds of net casket stores have set up shop, following the hundreds of independent real-world coffin retailers that sprang up in the early 1990s. while their combined sales barely top one percent of the industry total, they've turned funeral directors ghost-white with fear.the directors have fought back, arguing that many of the independent vendors are two-bit hucksters out to sucker grieving families. the independent vendors aren't regulated like the funeral directors, and their service guarantees vary wildly, the directors claim.while there may be some bad vendors out there, many of the directors' attacks have been patently unfair, say independent sellers.\"they've tried everything to eliminate the third-party vendors,\" said bill collier, owner of collier's casket store in austin, which sells both from a local store and the web.independent casket vendors charge that funeral directors routinely disparage the quality of their caskets, evoking images of handles snapping off or fluids dripping from shoddy coffins. the caskets may be expensive, but they're worth it, they say to customers who might be tempted by a cheaper alternative.\"the caskets you get online are inferior, yes they are. they're not as good at all,\" said pat lane, who, in addition to being a funeral director is the spokesman for the california funeral directors association.moreover, when people buy them, he says, they put him in a bad spot. \"let's say your next door neighbor dies and the family buys a casket online. we put her in the casket, take four steps up the stairs at the ceremony, and mom falls out the bottom. who are they gonna sue?\"in one prominently documented case, a texas funeral director intentionally damaged a third-party casket a customer had purchased for a memorial service at the director's funeral home. the director then showed the marred casket to the grieving family.funeral directors have also taken a legislative tack, pushing for laws that would make it illegal for anyone but a licensed director to sell caskets. several states have such laws in place, often based on the contention that only funeral directors can guarantee caskets that prevent the spread of disease.hogwash, says the funeral consumers alliance's carlson.\"does a rancher have to put a dead cow in a casket?\" he asked rhetorically. \"i mean, give me a break.\"the funeral directors make one valid point, critics say: only they carry the top casket brands.batesville caskets, the largest manufacturer in the us with over 40 percent of the market, won't sell to anyone but a licensed funeral director. neither will york or aurora, the nos. 2 and 3 coffin-makers.the funeral directors have made it very clear -- if you sell to the independents, then you lose their business.\"if i found out they were selling to joe schmoe net retailer down the street, i'd change my casket company,\" said lane.to independent vendors, the arrangement smacks of illegal collusion.\"it's an anti-trust issue. they're trying to lock us out of the market,\" said laura wend, an independent casket retailer and an officer at the national casket retailers association, a trade group for independent sellers.industry lawyers are drawing up an anti-trust case, she said.batesville, at least, seems unconcerned. \"we spend many dollars in court fighting against casket stores who sue us for not selling to them,\" said joe weigel, a batesville spokesman. \"as long as we remain consistent with our policy, we believe we'll be fine with the federal trade commission.\"the ftc, in the midst of a review of its funeral regulations, declined comment on the matter, except to say that it's been swamped with input from both funeral directors and casket vendors. it could issue new regulations as early as next spring.while the ftc ponders, the industry evolves on its own. competition has already forced many funeral directors to lower their casket prices, a loss that critics say they recoup by jacking up the prices for other services.it's all about protecting the bottom line, says lane.\"it's a business,\" he said. \"we need to run our business. you're not going to get a brand new mercedes benz for what the dealer paid. i've got to pay the light bill, i've got to pay the water bill.\"and, for the price, you get the special, thoughtful service only a professional funeral man can offer, he adds.\"i sure as hell wouldn't want to walk into a funeral store and see a guy that looked like a used car salesman,\" lane said. \"i wouldn't want to get a casket online -- it might be from mexico! just the other day i saw one that looked like a guadalajara special. i want my family to know they're going to be serviced from the moment they step in my door to the last shovel of dirt.\"for increasing numbers of the net savvy, that sort of service may soon become a thing of the past.\"i'm 54,\" said the funeral consumers alliance's hankins. \"by the time people reach my age, usually they've had some experience with the industry that has motivated them to want to find a better way. now, there's a lot more information about alternatives readily available to anyone with an internet hook up.\"another chill breeze buffets delano."}
