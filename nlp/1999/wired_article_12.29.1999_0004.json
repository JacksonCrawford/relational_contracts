because its business week starts on sunday, 2 january. jihad abdullah reports from dubai.", "author": "jihad abdullah", "category": "science", "type": "article", "timestamp": "12.29.1999 03:00 AM",

most arab countries will come 24 hours earlier than the rest of the globe, on sunday, 2 january.officials in saudi arabia, the united arab emirates, jordan, egypt, and the palestinian-held west bank said their countries will take advantage of the sunday business day for further testing of their systems' last-minute compatibility and compliance.in fact, in egypt, banks will be testing on 1 january to see if the systems will be able to receive the public on sunday.there is general optimism among y2k officials throughout the arab region, even though the area is so vast and so different from country to country -- and even though it houses the world's largest oil reserves.saudi arabia and the uae have announced near-100 percent compliance as 1 january approaches.the poorer -- or least advanced -- countries such as syria, egypt, and jordan are also marching into the new year with compliance confidence. interestingly, projections of y2k performance are more of a mixed bag in the wealthier and more technologically inclined nations.in dubai, uae, a police spokesman last week announced the department is watching some \"suspicious attempts\" from international and regional criminals to hack personal accounts in local banks. \"our computer crimes unit is handling this issue and we are working with the banks to prevent such attacks,\" colonel ahmad bin dalmouk said.meanwhile, dubai's federal health ministry announced emergency status in some of the federal old hospitals, including al baraha hospital. the decision suspended all nonurgent surgeries until 2 january, and most of the stable patients were evacuated.however, local government hospitals are not affected by this decision because they are mostly y2k compliant. for example, the dubai health department spent aed11 million (us$3 million) to update its health systems.similar levels of readiness are announced in the other emirates, including abu dhabi, sharja, ajman, rak, uaq, and fujaira. however, it is expected that there may be difficulties in the mountainous areas.the latest good word came monday from the west bank, where a palestinian expert announced the acquisition of sufficient funds and hardware to overcome what had loomed as a major noncompliance problem in major hospitals and transport services.\"we've got an emergency loan from our financial department, and the necessary machines from usaid and norway,\" said imad younis, west bank national coordinator for palestinian y2k committee.palestinians also received a boost from israel, whose infrastructure provides the west bank with electricity, water, and communications supplies. \"they [the israelis] committed not to use these services for any political pressure in this period of time,\" younis said.syria, recently involved in intense peace negotiations with israel, has been tabbed as the arab region's most well-prepared country even though it is one of the least technologically advanced.international monitoring's favorable view of syria legitimizes a comprehensive, three-year campaign to become y2k compliant, led by the president's son bashar al assad.the main concern here is that international monitoring was only testing government-written certificates. however, a syrian computer engineer in dubai, who requested anonymity, believes the report. \"syria is a virgin country in terms of technology,\" he said. \"most of the machines there are less than five years old, while the absence of an anti-piracy law enabled the public to get high-end software packages at reasonable prices.\"egypt, which boasts the arab world's largest population and oldest economy, faces its own challenges. but, said cabinet information and decision support center ceo rafat radwan: \"we are relatively ready to the same level of readiness known in the world, compared to the level of technologies present in our country.\"radwan said contingency and preventive plans -- which include oil refineries, the suez canal, and the major airports -- are in place, and that major emphasis was placed on oil industry compliance in the last few years.jordanian officials are also confident. \"most of the vital sectors are ready and had successfully tested their contingency plans,\" says yousef nusseir, general manager of the national information center.in jordan, the private sector is heavily automated but the public sector is not. the central bank of jordan said most of the country's banks are now ready. the national airport is iata-certified, while the national airlines company had just announced full compliance and even suspended flights to some regional noncomplaint airports.no signs were received from the industrial sector, including the country's only oil refinery. however, jordan usually keeps a 3-month emergency supply of oil.among other wealthy nations, kuwait, bahrain, and qatar are still facing some problems. the bahrain and qatar airports have not yet been certified by the iata, so most of the regional and international flights to these airports have been suspended as of 31 december.saudi arabia has been classified as 98 percent compliant; however, independent sources in riyadh think there may be some disturbances in rural areas' communications and power supplies.on sunday, the us embassy in doha, qatar, warned american nationals of possible y2k related threats, due to the incompliance of the national airlines gulfair.in kuwait, there are still some questions regarding the readiness of the telecommunications directory and immigration systems. a kuwaiti faculty member told the press on saturday he doubts the ministry of health is y2k-compliant. \"there is still a possibility of non-programmed rocket launching,\" said k. asoousi, head of the kuwait computer association."}
