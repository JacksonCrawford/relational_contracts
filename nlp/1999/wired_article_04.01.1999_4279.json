barely within the range of the latest gigabit routers. move up to multiple channels of high-definition video, at 6 mbps each, and the bandwidth requirements rise accordingly, necessitating more and more routers with much higher capacities - gigabit, even terabit routers.now, do the math.twenty years ago there were 100 million emails sent each year, versus 135 billion pieces of first-class mail. in 1997 the two reached parity at about 190 billion each. ten years ago data was barely 5 percent of all telecommunications traffic. today, with internet traffic doubling every 100 days, it's nearing 50 percent. the cost of moving data has fallen by an order of magnitude, from 10 cents per kilopacket per second in the late '80s to less than one cent today.realize that this is only the beginning.home networks are emerging. wireless broadband is looming. voice and data networks are converging. within five years, the yankee group estimates, data will account for about 70 percent of all telecom traffic.the implications are both breathtaking and banal: office buildings bathed in an ether of high-speed wireless data. plummeting long distance rates. musical instruments played across the internet. voice, data, video, audio - all coming down the same pipe. each accounted for and billed separately. change without precedent. business opportunity galore.call it internet 2.0 or, as cisco systems ceo john t. chambers prefers, the new world network. by whatever name, offering high-speed access to everyone at any time will necessitate beefing up the existing public data infrastructure - the \"infranet.\" all along every line. everywhere.this technological imperative explains why cisco, which controls about 30 percent of the market for data networking equipment and around 80 percent of the key router segment, is poised to explode. never mind that cisco is already the fastest-growing company ever listed on nasdaq. that was only the first act.\"in the next five years,\"says tom nolle of cimi, a consulting firm in new jersey, \"more money will be spent on new telephone equipment than the sum total undepreciated value of all the gear in place today. this is a tidal wave of at least $500 billion in new spending that's about to hit. the scary thing for every other equipment vendor is that most of it is cisco's to lose.\"says chambers: \"it is our goal to be the largest computer player ever in terms of changing the way people work, live, play, and learn.\"unprecedented opportunity. but, for cisco, also extraordinary danger. telecom behemoths like lucent and nortel (both more than twice cisco's size) are stampeding toward the same opportunities and could wipe out the relative newcomer. and in a market with relatively few barriers to entry, nothing is stopping any of the dozens of start-ups nipping at cisco's heels from overtaking it.after all, it was a very similar breed of mathematics that propelled cisco itself, during the first internet explosion, from a niche company with $69 million in 1990 revenues to a multinational with $8.5 billion in 1998 sales.\"this is no slam dunk for cisco,\" says joe baylock, a longtime cisco analyst at the gartnergroup's san jose office, across town from cisco. \"no matter how much the company may preach end-to-end cisco gear, in the ip world everyone's equipment works with everyone else's.\"voice is datathe worldwide data networking equipment business is worth about $30 billion a year. it is dominated by cisco; the also-rans include 3com, bay networks (now owned by nortel), cabletron, and ascend (in the process of being swallowed by lucent). excluding network cards and hubs (which cisco doesn't make), the sector is exploding, growing at better than 40 percent per annum, according to jeremy duke of synergy research group.the much larger business of circuit-switched voice equipment is worth about $110 billion. it's dominated by lucent, with $30 billion in sales, and by nortel, with $18 billion - and it's growing at less than 7 percent a year.the two networks are converging. data networks, which gain robustness by simply routing around trouble spots, are much cheaper to install and maintain than voice networks, with their multiple and redundant million-dollar telco switches. and broadband ip networks - designed to hurl around big network apps, digital video, cd-quality music, et cetera - can carry huge quantities of voice traffic at almost no extra cost.in short order, the trend toward sending voice over data networks could quintuple cisco's size.this fact alone explains why makers of circuit-switched gear are falling all over themselves trying to buy their way into the ip game, not only with big acquisitions like ascend and bay, but by snapping up niche players. since 1996, lucent has bought 11 data networking companies outright, and it's now busy making smaller strategic investments, including a stake in juniper networks, a mountain view start-up working on a terabit router.gaining just 10 percent of the market for voice equipment would double cisco's revenues. chambers, however, mandates the company must have at least a 25 percent share. preferably 40 to 70 percent. in short order, the trend toward sending voice over data networks could quintuple cisco's size.\"[the old equipment makers are] mathematically unlikely to catch us,\" says chambers, shrugging off their size, their technology, their money. \"the stock market is assuming that lucent and nortel are going to be able to effortlessly go from a circuit-switched infrastructure to a data-based one, where productivity is three times as great per employee and where acquisitions will be critical. it's a world moving so fast that we are having trouble keeping up with our customers. and we know data networking inside out.\"this is a defensible advantage. listen to marty kaplan, chief technology officer at sprint, one of the incumbents in the telecom game: \"five years ago we started to design an entirely new network, one that would be last-mile independent and protocol insensitive. we wanted to carry voice, but also any kind of data that came along. no more separate platforms for voice, frame relay, atm, and ip the way it is today. it had to integrate, integrate, integrate.\"the result is sprint ion (for \"integrated on-demand network\"), which is aimed at delivering dynamically to the end user virtually any amount of bandwidth as needed. currently being rolled out in 15 major us cities, ion is relying on cisco as its primary supplier.why? \"we needed a partner who knew how to move fast, who was willing to throw out the old rules,\" explains kaplan, \"and most of all someone who knew how to be a partner. cisco has a long way to go when it comes to getting away from the selling-more-boxes mentality to the system-reliability-and-services model that a telecommunications provider expects. but they're at least one or two product revs ahead of any of our old-line gear suppliers.\"but the old-school vendors have some key weapons, including a clutch of obscure switching and voice-signaling protocols that's strong enough to keep most newcomers out.cisco, of course, has a talent for routing its way through such obstacles. in what might be its most important acquisition of the last couple years, the company spent $194 million to acquire a small firm called lightspeed international in december 1997. lightspeed's specialty: a vital protocol called signaling system no. 7. every time you use a phone connected to a traditional circuit-switched network, you use ss7. push \"1\" on your telephone and ss7 indicates a long distance call is coming. follow that \"1\" with, say, \"212\" and ss7 directs the call toward manhattan's circuits. in essence, ss7 sets up, then tears down, individual connections.before being bought by cisco, lightspeed was working on a unix-based system for manipulating ss7 protocols - and other bits of esoteric telephonica - that wasn't tied to any particular gearmaker's proprietary technology. this system offered a programming environment that was designed to let a smart set of software engineers craft some very sophisticated telephony-related applications. with cisco as its new parent, the lightspeed team blended in ip. the resulting device, which handles both ip and circuit-based connections, costs about a hundred thousand dollars but effectively functions as a high-end telco switch - the kind lucent sells for millions.the terabit challengeevery step toward the new network has direct repercussions for cisco's firstborn: the network router. as megabit machines become a thing of the past and gigabit machines the norm, the state of the art will soon be terabit powerhouses.says chambers: \"it is our goal to be the largest player ever in terms of changing the way people work, live, play, and learn.\"the company is keeping quiet about its terabit plans, focusing instead on moving its new gigabit routers. but a variety of widely publicized and well-funded start-ups are hoping to leapfrog cisco. the best known is juniper networks, but a gaggle of others, including massachusetts-based avici systems and pluris of cupertino, california, are also pursuing terabit schemes. of course, the biggest challenge to cisco's router supremacy will probably come not from these smaller players, but their big-time backers. lucent is an investor in juniper; nortel owns 20 percent of avici.another challenge will be keeping up with the technology as the distinction between switches and routers collapses. classic routing (circa 1996) meant that ip switches and routers were stand-alone products. the router told the packets where to go, and the switch moved them around. switches, being primarily hardware, are much more reliable than routers, which use lots of software calculations to figure out exactly where to send packets.the newest routers are also switches. they combine the wire-speed advantages of switches with the intelligence of routers.the switch router was originally championed by bay networks and 3com, but cisco has become a fervent supporter. its top-of-the-line 12000 gsr series (see \"gigantuan\") was developed in-house and is one of the fastest switch routers currently shipping.closer to the glassto move packets at the terabit speeds that will be required by the new network, ip has to interface directly with fiber. this means new routers will be needed to internetwork with the glass at fiber-optic speeds.companies like qwest, level 3, and williams have laid enormous fiber trunks and are in the process of expanding their networks. level 3's current fiber network, for instance, can carry an amount of data equivalent to 40 times the world's daily long distance phone calls.currently, most of the traffic being shunted across the fiber uses expensive equipment running two old-school, fail-safe protocols: sonet (synchronous optical network) and atm (asynchronous transfer mode).this world is about to explode. a number of new data networks from the likes of sprint, enron, and frontier are now avoiding these protocols almost entirely, using ip to work in the optical world. this reduces latency by sending data through fewer boxes and means the networks can scale to extremely high bit rates. canada's ca*net3, a government, university, and research backbone, will use ip over fiber and transfer data at speeds approaching 40 gigabits per second.in networks like these, routers end up replacing the sonet and atm switching equipment. which is great news for cisco and terrible news for traditional sonet and atm vendors like fore systems and tellabs. cisco has more than a hundred people working on creating products that directly interface with the fiber, and has already released the first generation.smart billingselling cheap voice minutes over the net is only the foot in the door. the big opportunity is to think up new services that could be delivered over this suddenly cheap, plentiful, and still unregulated channel. what about a unified messaging service that provides voice, fax, voicemail, and email all through a local call?\"enhanced services aren't worth doing unless there is a way to bill for them,\" says john coons, an analyst at dataquest.the economics of the new network means that all-you-can-eat high-speed access for $40 a month is very unlikely. flat-rate pricing simply can't finance the infrastructure buildout. most users will end up paying for the network resources they actually use, and even extra to ensure high-priority, high-reliability communications. which creates a potential billing nightmare for the isps and telcos that provide and deliver new broadband services.\"right now there is no way to tell who is using expensive data services, and who isn't,\" coons explains. \"that is about to change.\"the traditional router is designed to be democratic - it doesn't discriminate against any given data packet. whether a packet is a snippet of an urgent phone call or a bit of a spam, it has an equal right to the router's services.the new net router needs to be more discriminating. to handle hundreds of high-speed lines effectively, it needs to know which type of data it is handling, its priority, and, not least of all, how much someone is paying to have it delivered.the big opportunity is to think up new services to be delivered over this suddenly cheap, plentiful, and still unregulated channel.it is already possible to do some specialized billing today, but only by using a series of complicated workarounds. cisco has created an ip billing initiative with hewlett-packard that aims to solve the problem more elegantly. the system is designed to let voice-over-ip and other broadband services be billed the way traditional telcos prefer.but others are working on different ways to solve this new net conundrum. one attempt is a hardware/software device from a sunnyvale start-up called redback networks. redback's \"subscriber management system\" allows different broadband services - video, interactive gaming, web browsing - to be simultaneously delivered down a single dsl line, while each is accounted for and billed separately.the wonderful world of wirelesswhere cisco is weakest is wireless. most people today are familiar with only two types of wireless: cell phones and pagers. in general, today's multipoint wireless networks are still too slow - speeds top out at 14.4 kbps, and effective speeds are more like 9.6k - to efficiently handle more than email and alphanumeric paging.but broadband wireless is coming to the lan. radiata communications, a small australian company, is creating chipsets for wireless lan systems that can deliver 32-mbps data streams to mobile users.much further out, broadband wireless will be available through networks of satellites. globalstar and the \"don't bet against 'em\" billionaire duo of craig mccaw and bill gates are pursuing this market. teledesic's idea is to put more than 250 satellites into low earth orbit, route ip data between them, and beam it down to terrestrial sites. only one test satellite is in orbit so far, but teledesic is spending $10 billion to have the system operational by 2003. and these satellites don't need cisco gear - they create an entirely different routing and switching fabric among themselves. the system is basically a giant router encircling the planet.of course, wireless can also be an opportunity for cisco. at the beginning of february, cisco teamed up with motorola on its own broadband wireless scheme, which uses the cell phone network. the companies plan to spend as much as $1 billion over the next five years on it. and last year cisco made a significant move by buying clarity wireless. the small start-up was working on a fixed wireless technology - lmds, or local multipoint distribution service - that allows megabits of data to be beamed to tiny microwave dishes on remote office buildings. cisco now wants to apply it to residential communities. and even teledesic will need some high-capacity routers for its planetside operations.buying spreewhen asked who he fears most - the big companies or the start-ups - chambers' answer is immediate: \"i have a list of a dozen little companies that i'm tracking very closely,\" he says, although he refuses to share it. \"guys who can start from a fresh sheet of paper have an enormous advantage technologically. we have to carefully integrate new capabilities into our existing product lines, and that is tougher. they keep us on our toes.\"as the race to build the new net has heated up, cisco has made a series of key purchases designed to either blunt or co-opt some of the crucial developments. since 1993 it has used its superheated stock to acquire some 30 companies. there were nine acquisitions in 1998 - the most in one year since the company formed in 1984.in the 24 deals for which the purchase price was disclosed, cisco paid more than $7.9 billion. the largest was stratacom, which sold atm and frame-relay technology to big businesses; cisco bought it in april 1996 for $4.7 billion. most, however, are much smaller, weighing in at around $100 million.\"time to market is crucial to us,\" says michelangelo (mike) volpi, who as vice president for business development has been in charge of cisco's acquisitions for four years. \"but so is being able to identify emerging technologies that are going to be important, and grabbing them. we couldn't possibly develop all the pieces on our own, nor would we want to. at a start-up a small team of folks will work 20-hour days for months to get a product out the door, and take a shot at the big financial reward. those are the type of people we want to join us. we use our stock to give them the big payoff, and get a jump on getting to market.\"too often, technology acquisitions are crippled by a lack of corporate structure, and resemble one start-up buying another - crucial systems, like payroll, benefits, and communications, simply melt down. at cisco, every detail is considered. within 30 days all the basics are taken care of: phone systems integrated, paychecks handled, email forwarded, business cards printed, pension and 401(k) plans updated. most of all, volpi says, \"we want to retain everyone.\"but what do you do if you can't buy 'em? tame them, of course. cisco has strategic partnerships with more than a dozen a-list technology firms, including hp, sun, ibm, microsoft, intel, dell, motorola, oracle, peoplesoft, alcatel, gte, sprint, u s west, eds, and kpmg. an impressive list, to be sure, but chambers is realistic: \"how many partnerships have been a success so far in my industry? exactly two: microsoft and intel created the pc industry; hp and canon in printers was worth $7 billion.\"cisco gives employees platinum-plated options, but it also gets. it now has some of the most productive workers in the tech world.he's also determined. \"too many partnerships fail because they don't get the resources and credibility within the organization. when we started to do this, i took one of my top guys and made him a senior vice president for strategic partnerships. he reports directly to me and has his own staff, so he doesn't have to go begging for the help he needs.\"his dream date: hewlett-packard. \"hp has created a culture where their word is their bond. we have dozens of alliances going on with that company, and not a single contract. that's my kind of partner.\"cisco's not a bad partner either - especially for its employees. platinum-plated stock options have made at least 2,000 of its 16,000 employees millionaires. in silicon valley, where 30 percent attrition rates are not uncommon, cisco's is less than 5 percent. and what cisco gives it also gets. its employees are now some of the most productive in the tech world - even more so than microsoft's. for the 1998 fiscal year, revenue per employee averaged $563,000 at cisco, versus $535,000 up in redmond. at lucent the figure was an anemic $214,000.cisconomicsadd it all up.in early february, cisco announced its latest quarterly earnings. revenues were up 40 percent over a year earlier. profits, on a per share basis, grew by more than 30 percent. it was the company's 36th consecutive quarter of growth in revenue and earnings. a single share purchased in the 1990 ipo, after five 2-for-1 and two 3-for-2 splits, now totals 72 shares. that $18 investment is worth roughly $7,000. john chambers' net worth exceeds $360 million. cisco's market capitalization currently exceeds $160 billion.now it's time to start growing.plusgigantuan"}
