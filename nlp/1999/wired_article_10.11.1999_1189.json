(that's another thing -- it eats batteries).after that fiasco, the vii was tossed in a drawer and i returned to my original palm. but after i saw last week's announcement of new shopping services from amazon and ebay, i figured i'd give it another go.although i loathe to shop, amazon's new wireless service, which allows you to buy books, music and check out auctions over the airwaves, looks pretty nice.it's great that there's no need to fire up the computer if you're itching to make a purchase. and you can buy something, or research it, instantaneously, whether you're at home or even on the bus.mysimon's comparison shopping app also looks promising. mysimon lets impecunious shoppers compare prices at a range of online and offline outlets.i played around with it while browsing the shelves of the local tower records discount outlet. the tower store was the cheapest by a good margin, but it felt good to be checking prices. and one of my colleagues who recently bought a palm vii loves it -- he has used it to file stories wirelessly, check flights and the wireless yellow pages.while i'm disheartened that shopping applications for the palm vii are the slickest thing going, hopefully they are signs of what may be coming down the pipe for other types of information the palm vii itself is reliable and easy to use. but the services are immature. maybe some day they'll catch up to the hardware."}
