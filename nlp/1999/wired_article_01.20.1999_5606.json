they just need some context,\" renna said.some other online thesauruses, like roget's, have seemingly avoided the charged territory altogether by not having a listing for homosexual.burns said that while the current plan is to remove the listing of homosexual from their thesaurus, merriam-webster will continue to list the word in its dictionary, along with others that describe minority groups.\"the dictionary will continue to define words that reflect a comprehensive use and understanding of the language as it is used today,\" said burns.renna agreed with this, but hoped that derogatory words will be put into context. \"people should understand that words like nigger and fag do exist, but it should be clearly indicated that they are derogatory terms,\" she said."}
