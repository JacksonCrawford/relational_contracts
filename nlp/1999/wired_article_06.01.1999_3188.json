then, he emerged as a potential deal breaker in the proposed lycos/usa networks merger, having purchased 80 percent of the portal in 1995 for $2 million. the sticking point: web-bullish investors feared that barry diller's tv-based out-fit would drag the net vehicle down to earth. in short order, wetherell resigned from the lycos board and threatened to launch his own takeover, before finally deciding to let the shareholders decide. the controversy, though, didn't slow cmgi's pace; wetherell's since begun building a competitor to broadcast.com, bought audience-measurement company i/pro, taken critical path public, and readied engage technologies for its own ipo. __wired: you say the web is risk free? how do you figure?wetherell: the web has been growing roughly 5 percent a month for the last five years - we don't see that slowing down anytime soon. at one point geocities' fundamental metrics grew at about 1 percent per day for seven consecutive quarters. if you're well positioned, have a good business model, and can't make a living in an industry growing 5 percent a month, you oughta go pick oranges.so what piques your interest in a business plan?i look for something that's scalable - that can have at least a billion-dollar market cap down the road. a web site that's very viral. world-class technology. the further along you are as a first mover, the much larger you have a chance of becoming.part of the reason for cmgi's big success is your majority-owned operating companies like navisite and engage. what do you offer that they wouldn't get from a typical venture firm?we provide employees shares of the operating units and shares of cmgi, because it takes sometimes years to incubate these companies. with cmgi shares, they benefit from the fruits of their labor, even if they haven't benefited from a public offering yet.you started making another kind of public offering last year - posting on yahoo!'s stock boards, which led to an investment in financial site raging bull.i learned a lot about how the world perceives us. it was time well spent - especially because we ended up getting a good investment out of it.isn't it kind of dicey for the ceo of a publicly traded company to hop on the message boards?the sec is watching it closely, but i think there is a freedom-of-speech issue. the aclu isn't going to stand for it if people can't freely chat - you can talk about everything else, but not stocks?so we can expect to see other execs follow suit?ceos want to make sure that their shareholders and the market understand the company's story. message boards are one of the great vehicles for group communication. why not leverage them for investor relations and corporate communications?what other new areas should we be watching?vertical online services are a big opportunity yet to be realized. verticalnet's doing it. geocities is really 40-some neighborhoods, each a vertical online community; wallstreet, for example, now features all the things you'd want for a financial-services portal.you're expanding into brick-and-mortar neighborhoods as well - cmgi's got an 11 percent stake in the combined hollywood entertainment/reel.com, the number-two chain after blockbuster.let's face it, a lot of people desire immediate gratification, and there are only so many \"near video on demand\" movies. the average hollywood video has 10,000 to 12,000 to choose from, and reel.com over 100,000. it turns out they don't cannibalize each other - and hollywood alone is adding half a million members a month.you seem to thrive on the operations side. would you be happy as managing partner of a pure venture capital fund?a lot of venture people see the grass as greener on the operations side, and a lot of operations people see the grass as greener on the venture side. i have the best of both worlds. and the beauty of it is, both worlds leverage each other - you get better returns.you've gotten a lot of ink from your role in the lycos deal. what's your line on barry diller's chances?the shareholder vote won't be until july or august, and there are only a few paths: lycos gets the deal done with usa, on the terms that are on the table today; it gets voted down and lycos stays independent; usa improves the deal terms; or somebody else comes along and improves the deal terms with another offer. in the meantime, the market can decide whether it's a good deal or not.how does this affect lycos?the media companies need a portal strategy a lot more than the portal companies need the media companies. after yahoo! - at $38 to $40 billion - lycos is the last kingmaker left. there's nobody anywhere close to their market cap, or their 50 percent reach. and as the growth rate of the internet continues, these portals are just going to get higher and higher reach. media companies have been waiting for this bubble to burst, but the prices aren't going to get any cheaper.there's no bubble?even if a little bit of a bubble bursts, there are real businesses that will continue growing at internet rates, and the valuations will return to where they are. more people keep spending more eyeball time, and eventually tv as we know it becomes obsolete. you better have a portal company - or make yourself a portal. now, maybe time warner or fox doesn't need to go buy a portal, but it's getting late early.diller wouldn't disagree.diller says the internet is overvalued, that it isn't a real business. that hasn't changed the market's opinion at all. the market doesn't buy that.but what changed your mind about the deal?this is a mismatch of assets. it's harder to mix online and offine than i thought. the reason that is, is metcalfe's law: the net is built around the multiple power of interconnections that occur as the number of nodes in a network grows. you can't apply metcalfe's law to traditional broadcast, because it's one to many, and you wind up with different market multiples.do you see risk anywhere?in the growth is security. what's high risk? i think traditional media is high risk."}
