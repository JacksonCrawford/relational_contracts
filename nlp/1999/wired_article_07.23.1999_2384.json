think of how many times you make the same motions!\"while such limitations on repetitive work are laudable, quilter said, they are not enough. she recommends that computer usage -- the activity that causes the most rsi -- be limited to one to two hours a day, even in healthy people with no signs of rsi.but even those who can't give up an activity entirely can still find relief. the first step, according to quilter, is proper diagnosis.\"doctors need to recognize rsi and to distinguish between the different types of injuries. carpal tunnel is not dequervain's disease and should not be treated the same. a good doctor will spend about an hour with you doing muscle testing and taking a thorough history before diagnosing you.\"in today's managed care systems -- where doctors aren't likely to spend even 10 minutes with a patient -- such thorough diagnoses are few and far between, she said. \"doctors don't take 10 minutes with you, much less an hour, and they just write out a prescription for a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and that's the end of it.\"it's also important that rsi sufferers take frequent breaks -- five minutes for every 20 minutes of work at minimum -- that they build up body strength, exercise aerobically, and improve posture and movement, quilter said.people who ignore symptoms and work through the pain, quilter warned, face dire consequences.\"i have dealt with many people who can't lift a fork, brush their teeth, drive a car to pick up their kids, do the most basic things in life because of rsi damage,\" quilter said. \"it's accumulative and it won't go away by itself.\""}
