kestra of the pretentious malevolent sisters and fedwren of the sterling order of knights will be married at this event. jubal, guildmaster of the sterling order of knights, will be performing the ceremony.... location is in the kithicor forest where the lake meets the mountains,\" reads the announcement posted to fan realm everquest vault. in everquest, such player bonding has become as common as orcs or goblins. the game forces players to interact with others in order to beat opponents and advance to higher levels. monsters are too tough to tackle any other way. most often, these associations happen on the fly, when gamers group for an hour or two to overcome a particular challenge. it can lead to intimate moments.\"if you want my body, and you think i'm dwarfie!\" tagyerd coos to his female fellow adventurer during a monday night session. another, aravorn -- aka 17-year-old austin smith -- recounts, \"i have this character who was real suave with the ladies. i was partying with this woman and another guy for about a week. and i was subtly hitting on her, being all flirty, chatting privately. well, it turns out the guy and girl were married in real life, and playing in the same room.\"muds started gaining an audience as text-based affairs before the web came into existence. more recent net fare, like ultima online or meridian 59, offer players seemingly endless electronic landscapes and graphic icons for their alter egos.everquest lures scads of people into its digital reality with a meticulously rendered, quake-style environment and its emphasis on interaction.as players delve deeper into the game, however, these alliances tend to become formalized through the creation of guilds. with sobriquets like the holy order of armageddon (hoa), these guilds take themselves very seriously. guilds often craft elaborate tales of their heroics.smith, who leads the order of the dark star, hired someone to spin yarns about the guild. \"he's in charge of our 'public relations,'\" says smith.codes of conduct in the guild's web page cover behavior from the somber -- \"no hoa member is to maliciously, verbally, or sexually harass any other player in the game.\" -- to the silly -- \"hoa members are required to have a character name conducive to a fantasy game. in other words ... no names such as mr.cool or butt-wipe.\" some of these guilds began in other online role-playing games, like diablo or ultima online.but this online existence comes with its own particular midlife crisis.\"i had a different idea of getting to higher levels; i thought you could do more,\" stephen crigger groans. it turns out that life at level 30 is pretty much the same as at level one: killing monsters and looting their corpses for treasure. except at the game's advanced stages, more and more beasts have to be defeated in order to advance.\"it gets monotonous,\" crigger said. \"i don't have time to run around and goof off like i used to.\"\"is it about the relationships, or about the game?\" asks wisteria williows, a fayetteville, arkansas, mother of three who so eagerly anticipated everquest's release that she wrote stories on fan site everworld.net about her forthcoming adventures.\"we wanted to role play a lot, but there's no chance. you have to do 'power leveling' or else you'll be level 20 forever -\u00ad and that'd be even worse,\" the druid-selling crigger sighs.hunter godfrey, who gets most of his game time in as he's rocking his infant to sleep, sees it another way. he recently bid on a high level character on ebay so that his buddy, \"stuck at 12th level,\" could play with him. godfrey notes, \"unless you have an outlet to role play, the game gets old.\""}
