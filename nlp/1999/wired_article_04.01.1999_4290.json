__what a farce, using a credit card to determine whether or not an internet user is of legal age (\"girls! girls! links!\" wired 7.01, page 68). leave it to the government to come up with a plan to \"protect\" minors that has a loophole a semitractor trailer could drive through.i work in internet security, where at least 45 percent of the clientele are minors. at least one-third of them have credit cards. i even overheard one high school kid telling another about this \"hot\" site that she joined. she said that she just lied about her age and used her own credit card.__ stephen r. flanigansrobert@gulf.net ____ bugs rife __congrats on wired 7.01, the best wired i've ever read. but i do have a bone to pick. paul boutin's \"the bugs in your future\" (wired 7.01, page 76) left out two major bugs soon to bite the world.the first is d10k. the dow industrials are edging closer to breaking 10,000 every month. how many of the world's financial systems have locked the size of the dow into four digits instead of five?second, when people log on to the internet, they receive a unique ip address. those addresses are going to be used up in the next five to six years. the real solution, ipv6, is still on the horizon.__ paul fischerpaf23@yahoo.com ____ euro flash __i can't believe that wired's roundup of future bugs missed the euro conversion. sure, it's not a bug per se, but in terms of needing corrective action it will be at least as expensive as y2k. the gartnergroup reports that making corporate europe euro-compliant will cost between $150 billion and $400 billion.__ joab jacksonjoabj@charm.net ____ simple stuff ... like motherboards __i thoroughly enjoyed the article by howard rheingold, \"look who's talking\" (wired 7.01, page 128). it made me think about how and why i want technology in my life.i'm a simple person, always fighting to keep too much \"stuff\" out of my life and home. that aspect of the amish philosophy appeals to me. how many of us so thoughtfully choose our possessions? my perfect home would have only a few choice pieces of handcrafted wood furniture and a large open room filled with computers, scanners, and printers. i love technology. i'm an addict, and i have not been able to understand how my simple self and my techie self have been living together so well.i think i know now. the computer so nicely contains the complex (programs and games i love), the overwhelming (information i crave), and the beautiful (art, design, and images of nature i love to see). the cell phone is so small and compact, and yet it gives me so much! i can have it all in one small box or in one palm-sized device. no clutter!i say we all throw away 75 percent of the stuff we have in our lives and keep the pc, the cell phone, the bed, and some clothing. do we really need anything else?__ michele baermichele@netseven.net ____ pandora's market __in a world where \"more, bigger, faster\" has become a slavish measure of goodness, how refreshing to read howard rheingold's take on amish culture and their views on technology. there are lessons there for all of us, particularly wired and its tiresome obeisance to technolust. imagine the implications if we all decided to consider in advance what impact any new idea or gizmo might have on who we are and how we live together.__ raven earlygrowraven@mcn.org ____ hacker backer __i just wanted to tell the staff at wired to give themselves a pat on the back for giving the kevin mitnick case the publicity it deserves (\"the defender,\" wired 7.01, page 46). the mass media hasn't even touched the subject since mitnick was caught in 1995. the outcome of the case will be a deciding factor in how much control the government has over the internet, and in how scared people are of media-hyped hackers. let's also not overlook the fact that kevin mitnick has spent four years in jail without a trial, his constitutional rights ignored.__ gary kuhlmanspeedk0re@aol.com ____ low marx __wired has undergone an unfortunate transformation in the past year or so, from a staunch (if breathlessly written) bulwark of cyberculture to an increasingly strident platform for capitalist dogma. witness the absolutely ludicrous opening lines of \"dollar signs\" (wired 6.12, page 80): \"as the third millennium comes within spitting distance, two impulses dominate life around the globe - surging faith in capitalism and an endless fascination with the planetwide flow of data.\"have you guys watched cnn at any time in the past year? at no point in the last decade have people had less faith in the power of capitalism to improve the world. sure, people like porn mogul seth warshavsky (\"live nude trades!\" page 65) are eager to wring every last penny out of the web, but the average indonesian, korean, or russian has little faith in capitalism. we'll see how it plays out. until then, try to restrain the purple prose.__ christopher j. tassavac-tassava@nwu.edu ____ a tool for your thoughts __was it a coincidence that i had to find a penny to scratch the metallic ink off the cover of wired 7.01, an issue in which people discuss their favorite tools?__ robin sloansloanro1@pilot.msu.edu ____ trust buster __in \"neil tagare hardwires a 'super internet'\" (\"the wired 25,\" wired 6.11, page 112), michael behar wrote that flag was the first privately financed submarine fiber cable.for the record, the first privately financed transatlantic fiber-optic cable was ptat-1, completed in 1989 at a cost of $400 million. ptat-1 connected new york city with london via spurs to bermuda and ireland. at 1.26 gbps, tiny by today's standards, it was two-thirds of the total capacity across the atlantic at the time.if you look at telecom rates across the atlantic before 1989, you see an excellent example of the benefits of a managed monopoly. capacity is added as demand grows at a rate that keeps pricing stable. after 1989, you see price declines as competition forces prices toward cost.the real impact of ptat-1 was that it led to the breakup of the international telecom monopoly, paving the way for flag and neil tagare's project oxygen.__ brian hughesbgrh@alum.mit.edu ____ send your rants & raves to: __email: rants@wiredmag.comsnail mail: wired, po box 191826 san francisco, ca 94109-9866editorial guidelines: guidelines@wiredmag.comeditorial correspondence: editor@wiredmag.com"}
