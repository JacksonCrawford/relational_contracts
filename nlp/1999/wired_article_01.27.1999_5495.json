voices, telling reporters: \"our athletes have come here to swim, not sing.\" it's now a given that many top athletes use one or another type of steroid. the question is: at what cost?one of those east german swimmers who became a worldwide symbol of scientific experimentation on athletes has now chosen to speak out. petra schneider, a gold medalist intackle wired news' super bowl coverage- - - - - -1980, has told the german press she has heart and liver problems that her doctor blames on \"the little blue pills\" containing steroids that she took as a 14-year-old.no sport has created an environment in which steroids flourish more than football -- simple physics tells you that it pays to have linemen as beefy as possible. to call it an open secret that huge numbers of nfl linemen use steroids would be a joke. it's no secret, open or otherwise.that's why the national football league has tried more than other leagues to crack down on the use of performance-enhancing drugs. it explicitly bans all anabolic steroids, plus the supplement androstenedione, which spurs production of testosterone. this is the over-the-counter drug mark mcgwire was taking last season on his way to a major-league record in homers.what's it like taking andro? what's it like taking steroids? wired news at first considered choosing this correspondent as a human guinea pig, feeding me lots and lots of steroids and hoping i wouldn't pound my keyboard into plastic shrapnel rather than bang out memorable first-person insights on better living through chemistry. upon further review, however, the idea was dismissed as too risky.instead, wired news tracked down mark and matt roe, who played together on san jose state's offensive line until 1996, a strong comeback for two athletes who were kicked off the san diego state team after testing positive for a form of steroid.the roes are identical twins, and they're thoughtful and articulate young men hoping to break into films. already, they've done several commercials and small films. you're bound to see them on your screen sooner or later, two scraggly, long-haired beach dudes around 6-foot-5, 245 pounds each. when one of them says \"the industry,\" you know which industry he's talking about.\"it's fascinating,\" mark told me by phone this week. \"the ancient greeks would use nectar from a flower to have protection from athena before going into battle. maybe it was some sort of stimulant that made them more aware. and the tribes in the rainforest, they take all sorts of stimulants they find in nature before they go into battle. that's just being human. since the beginning of time, humans have had relationships with plants and used them to help them succeed.\"steroids aren't plants,\" he continued. \"but they are an extension of that. a lot of people in the industry, models and actors, delve into it. like arnold, he's used all sorts of steroids. now he has a pig artery and a dialysis machine in his house. and stallone. there were reports that he'd used steroids before <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"externallink\",\"outgoingurl\":\"http://www2.reel.com/content/moviepage.asp?mmid=1949&amp;cobrand=fans\"}' href=\"http://www2.reel.com/content/moviepage.asp?mmid=1949&amp;cobrand=fans\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">cliffhanger</a>, and he got pretty ripped for that, too.\"the roes consider themselves lucky they got caught when they did in a random test. they've had many friends who used steroids, and have seen the damage taking them can do.as a statement issued by the national institutes of health puts it: \"parts of the brain that influence your moods and are involved in learning and memory are called the limbic system. anabolic steroids act in the limbic system. in animals, they have been shown to impair learning and memory. they can also lead to changes in mood, such as feelings of depression or irritability.\"anabolic steroid users may act mean to people they're normally nice to, like friends and family,\" the nih says. \"anabolic steroids in the brain may trigger really aggressive behavior. some outbursts can be so severe they have become known in the media as 'roid rages.'\"it's not just the media that knows about 'roid rages.'\"i've had friends who completely flew into 'roid rage,'\" mark told me. \"they woke up in the morning and were angry and they stayed angry all day. there's also the point where you start seeing your muscles deteriorate, like your body is shrinking and you want to get back on, because emotionally you need to have that. i've heard guys talking, 'i can't wait to get on another cycle,' and then you drive with him, and he's honking constantly, flipping people off all the time, and on the edge all the time.\"still, the biggest concern about steroids is the long-term health risk. that's especially true now that more girls are reportedly experimenting with steroids. according to a pennsylvania state university study, the percentage of eighth-grade girls who reported using steroids rose to 1.4 percent in 1996, up from 0.8 percent in 1991. in 10th graders, the use increased to 1.1 percent, from 0.5 percent in 1991.other, more recent estimates put the percentage of high-school boys experimenting with steroids as high as 18 percent. only five years ago, former oakland raiders team physician robert huizenga wrote in his book, you're ok, it's just a bruise, that nfl team doctors were in \"the dark ages,\" medically speaking.\"we have some understanding about the lasting effects of repeated concussions and the increased risk of playing on artificial turf,\" he wrote. \"there are, however, no meaningful studies on the risks athletes face when exposed to numbing shots, corticosteroids, anabolic steroids, amphetamines, growth hormones, repeated collisions, excessive weight gains, or any of the other peculiarities of life in the nfl. so we really can't offer players accurate advice until the nfl gives independent researchers the green light to study these issues and the green light to have team doctors act on their findings.\"the 1992 death of former raider lyle alzado brought home how mysterious the risks of steroids are. alzado had admitted using steroids as a player and he was convinced they were what gave him a brain tumor, despite research showing a link between anabolic steroids and two other forms of cancer -- prostate and liver -- but not his type.\"i had to have gotten it from that,\" alzado told people before his death.as new york times columnist george vecsey wrote a year ago: \"teams will be spending money to keep even with the other teams, the way paranoid linemen gobble down their steroids -- not only because they want to give themselves ludicrous bodies and hideous medical futures but also because they are immediately afraid of the wild-eyed maniac on the opposite side of the line.\"it's not easy to escape that cycle. the roes did -- with a little luck.\"i'm just glad that the ncaa is in place for just that reason, to protect players,\" mark told me. \"there are some serious repercussions to using steroids. if i hadn't been caught, i could have kept doing steroids. i could be in the nfl now and weighing 300 pounds.\"steve kettmann has covered professional sports for the "}
