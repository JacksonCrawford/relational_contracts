(talk times are longer in europe; the us version uses more energy on a higher frequency.) in fact, the phone, with a battery life longer than that of any other ericsson i've used, runs for days. an optional thicker battery delivers about 6 hours of talk in the us, or 120 hours of standby. the i 888 is about the same size and weight as the nokia 6100 series, but it has a flip to keep you from making calls accidentally.problems with this 6.3-ounce unit include a stubby antenna that doesn't retract and a plastic surface that easily scratches. the sound quality is impressive, but ericsson's interface needs work. the biggest trouble is with gsm itself: this phone is great for globe-trotters, but make sure there's gsm coverage near home in the states. i got my i 888 from omnipoint, which has excellent coverage in new england, but there won't be any gsm coverage in outlying hamlets like chicago until sometime next year.i 888 world: $299. ericsson: (800) 374 2776, street crednetwork in a cablevirtual velvet undergrounddangerous beautyglobopopbuying timeholy rollerthe feel worldreadmemusiciridium showersbrain bytesfishing the art-house streamthink fastjust outta betaimage consciouslonelies get linkedcontributors"}
