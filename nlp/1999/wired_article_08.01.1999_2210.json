(and rabid rucker fans take note: another volume, saucer wisdom, from forge books, is due out in bookstores this summer - a first-person narrative in which the author makes prognostications.)a life that's deep in the bowels of silicon valley manufacturing one minute, partying in a tokyo cyberpunk bar the next, and later wandering the streets of antwerp contemplating bruegel is a rich reminder that the future is now - and that we don't have to abandon the complexity of our selves now that we're here.<a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"externallink\",\"outgoingurl\":\"http://barnesandnoble.bfast.com/booklink/click?sourceid=383472&amp;is_search=y&amp;title=seek%21%3a+selected+nonfiction&amp;match=exact&amp;options=and\"}' href=\"http://barnesandnoble.bfast.com/booklink/click?sourceid=383472&amp;is_search=y&amp;title=seek%21%3a+selected+nonfiction&amp;match=exact&amp;options=and\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">seek!: selected nonfiction</a> by rudy rucker: $35 hardcover, $16.95 paperback. four walls eight windows: (800) 788 3123, www.fourwallseightwindows.com.street credbasement area networkhacking the vacuum tubefree of attachmentspolaroid's sticky portalburnt rubber, chicago stylebooting up beelzebubout of the celluloid closetreadmemusicsaar-sightedthe transreal thingi, nicklausamerican history f/xjust outta betalittle big screen\"it was just the law of large numbers at work\"contributors"}
