it's hard to control.\"\"the graphics are so good they kind of give me vertigo,\" said player joel strickland, who was dizzy after his round. \"i'm into the animation more than the game, which is good, because i did really bad.\"contestant after contestant played as the rest milled around in the brightly lit video store sucking down caffeinated soda provided by a local radio station. contestant miles richards caused enough of a stir to bring the lurking security guards running when he ran around the store whooping in anger after he lost his game at the last second.\"two hundred and thirty-seven rings i had,\" richards lamented, clutching his sega handout bag. \"i coulda had a year's worth of free videos! i had one second left to go and the monkey jumped on me and i lost all my rings!\"otherwise, the event was quiet and orderly, if competitive. tourney players were excited by the possibilities of dreamcast's 128-bit graphics and home-theater sound, if a little vexed that the promised 56k modem will not be built into rental units until the web interface is built for the september launch. as the hour grew later, even the younger players who were fascinated with dreamcast's first showing began to get a little edgy as their low-scoring adult counterparts slipped away without waiting for the tournament to end. \"we're not renting a unit, not tonight,\" said brenda crawford, whose 8-year-old daughter, brittany, was competing in the tourney. \"otherwise she'll be up all night. it's getting late already. she's just really crazy about sonic and she's been waiting forever to get a look at this new player.\"few players stayed to rent, but the tournament winner was ecstatic to have his hands on his very own pre-us release unit.thirteen-year-old rory aptekar beat out the rest of the players with 259 rings and beamed as he clutched his prize.\"i won, baby,\" he screeched through a proffered megaphone. \"that game is really, really, really cool. now i can play all the time and not have to wait until september.\"aptekar, who had played the game on an already released japanese dreamcast player, earned some audible grumbling from players who said he had an unfair advantage. but that didn't matter to aptekar, whose father indulgently said he'd let his son stay up and play as long as he wanted post-party. \"what the heck, he's not sleeping anyway,\" shrugged the elder aptekar.sega fans who missed wednesday's event will be able to rent dreamcast at hollywood video stores across the country, and 600 stores will have in-store units for players to try. in fact, information about dreamcast and what it can do will be pretty hard to miss: sega and hollywood video are rolling out a pricey, pumped-up ad campaign to whip up even more excitement.\"this is the biggest player launch in history,\" said dreamcast's manager of gamer public relations heather hawkins. \"dreamcast will be everywhere. between now and september you might get a little sick of hearing about dreamcast.\"hmmm."}
