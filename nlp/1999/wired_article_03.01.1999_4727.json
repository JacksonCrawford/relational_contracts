culture, demography, and technology are all pushing us toward one goal: extracting the last drop of fun out of every experience. the numbers back up this instinctive assessment. the rate of personal savings in the united states has declined to a 63-year low of 2.1 percent. yet entertainment spending is at a high of 8.4 percent of total consumer expenditures. even if you don't count consumer electronics - which means leaving out tv sets and vcrs - entertainment is a $480 billion industry in the us. leisure, entertainment, recreation, pleasure - no matter what you call it, we have become a world of fun-focused consumers.while the common perception is that we have less leisure than previous generations, studies show we have just as much spare time as folks had in the days of ozzie and harriet - approximately 30 hours a week. nonetheless, increasingly, fun is being equated with time. a survey last year revealed that 36 percent of valentine's day gift givers were forgoing the traditional presents of chocolates and flowers and presenting their significant others with spa passes, catered meals, even vouchers for cleaning services. in other words, they were giving the gift of a good time, or, more important, the free time that allows one to have a good time.this is part of a larger cultural shift in the perception of time. not long ago, leisure implied big blocks of unallocated time - time you could use to work in the garden, go bird-watching, read a book, do nothing. but through the influence of tv guide, the filofax, the pc scheduler, and the palmpilot, we have begun to conceptualize time in a very different way, seeing it not as a slow-moving river but as a highly segmented grid.concurrently, as time has become broken into variable-length blocks, it has become commoditized. today, we see our lives the way television executives see their week, as a series of little boxes that need to be filled. we have become highly sophisticated self-schedulers. as tv programmers do, we increasingly seek to break our time into small periods and to distribute these variable-length periods over the course of the week.as a result, the 30-hour reservoir of free time once concentrated on the weekend is enjoyed in smaller parcels. we find ourselves with two hours before picking up the kids at soccer practice, so we stop in at barnes & noble. a business traveler might steal 10 minutes before leaving the hotel to check email and local restaurant reviews on aol. a teenager does geometry homework with a natalie imbruglia video on mtv as musical wallpaper. even the larger blocks are shorter - today, more than half of all holiday trips are weekend trips, according to the travel industry association of america. (this trend has not been lost on the airline and hotel industries, which have developed a plethora of two- and three-day vacation packages.)the entertainment marketplace allows us to recapture some of the pleasure associated with free time by offering fun in big or small doses, as stand-alone fun, or as part of a more utilitarian activity. in the 1980s we all became masters at channel surfing. at the end of the 1990s, we are becoming \"time surfers\": a little here, a little there, keep it interesting, keep it moving. in the same way that nature abhors a vacuum, schedulers abhor an empty block. so we schedule activity for all of our time, dividing between (and sometimes double-scheduling) home and work life and our reservoir of that now anachronistic concept, free time.and if time-shifting is inherent in the new marketplace, so is place-shifting; there's a higher premium than ever on portability. we increasingly expect entertainment devices to allow us to have access to fun anywhere and everywhere, even when we're driving, working, or exercising. similarly, duration - how much of my precious time do i have to commit? - is more important than ever.__ entertainment is the lingua franca of modern commerce, as indispensable as currency. __as we become accustomed to treating the enjoyment of free time as a commodity, we're not only spending money on videogames, movies, and theme parks, but on formerly low-cost or no-cost activities such as gardening, flower arranging, or even riding a bicycle. you can now pay for the do-it-yourself kit, whether it's rose-pruning lessons, cooking, or instructional lovemaking tapes.consumers, already seasoned multitaskers in their professional lives, are increasingly looking to further maximize seemingly scarce leisure opportunities by seeking out products and services that include entertainment content as an additional part of their offering. the lure is the opportunity to make the most of that 30 hours of free time by combining entertainment with other activities, sometimes cannibalizing more \"productive\" time. studies done using surfwatch filtering software, for example, show that as much as 27 percent of corporate web traffic is not business-related. furthermore, an estimated 14.9 percent of employees who have internet access have shopped online while at work. after all, as long as you are logged on to the company's server, why not check out an automotive site, participate in an online auction on ebay, or find the latest sports scores on espn.com?in a culture that so values the productive and pleasurable uses of time, perceived waste is deadly. the apparent scarcity of free time and the necessity to plan for it has the effect of upping the ante for each entertainment decision. in a time-obsessed economy, a bad movie is more than a waste of time - it also represents a major opportunity cost in terms of the other fun you might have had. to limit those frustrating risks, consumers are now employing the same expert information resources and guidance tools in making entertainment decisions that business has long used for strategic decisionmaking. it does not require much behavior modification for an attorney who searches lexis for case law to turn to zagat's online restaurant guide to make a dining decision.these changed perceptions and uses of time have provoked adults into treating fun not just as a reward but as an entitlement. they expect it to be part of the package, and they feel shortchanged if they don't get it. in such a climate, enterprises have no choice but to include entertainment in their business offerings.to understand the importance fun has in dictating otherwise serious decisions, look at the resurgence of apple computer.after a series of management blunders, a history of corporate underperformance, and in the face of microsoft's domination of the computer market, apple remains the technology industry's most miraculous survivor. that's because its macintosh introduced the notion of creativity and fun to the computer industry. today, the company is not only surviving but thriving, thanks in large part to the brilliant launch of the imac under the renewed leadership of steve jobs. yes, the g3 chip is really fast. but one small word tipped the balance: fun.entertainment - as a pure form or as value added to other products - speaks directly to the emotions. writ large, such consumption choices are already influencing the national and international economy. consider what's happened to los angeles. as communism was crumbling overseas in 1988, the city and its environs, with 242,000 jobs in the aerospace industry, lived in dread of the post-cold war peace fallout. yet 10 years later, california officials estimate for every job lost in aerospace, the local economy gained two in entertainment - a sector that's experienced 83 percent growth since the end of the cold war.nothing has been more symbolic of la's transformation than the $95 million conversion of a trw defense plant into raleigh manhattan beach studios. defense assembly lines have been replaced by 14 soundstages for film and video production. the annual net gain of this and other post-cold war businesses in the local economy is an astounding $20 billion.on the other coast, new london, connecticut, was once basically a one-company town that built submarines for the us navy. military downsizing led to the loss of 17,000 jobs - more than 10 percent of the labor force. no local economy can take that kind of hit and survive. or so it was thought, before the opening of the foxwoods resort casino and the mohegan sun casino on nearby indian land. with the concentric circles of jobs spreading out from that entertainment epicenter, an otherwise crippling blow has been largely offset.__ today, we see our lives the way television executives see their week, as a series of little boxes that need to be filled. __in new york city, the economy's entertainmentization is even more impressive, in both relative terms and absolute size. new york wasn't hit with a peace crisis. instead, in the late 1980s it experienced a good old-fashioned stock market crash. that nosedive, coupled with a rash of mergers and takeovers, led to drastic downsizing in manhattan's mainstay financial and real estate industries. yet only 10 years later, new york's hotels are full. film and video crews tie up traffic in every borough. tourists are flocking from all over the world to see the shows and sights, including a times square stripped of porn stores and revitalized in part by a $60 million investment by disney. in pure entertainment-production expenditures, this turnaround has pumped an extra $6 billion annually into the local economy. throw in tourism, which in new york is mostly about consuming entertainment in one form or another, and you have an $11 billion bulge.of course, you might say that new york and hollywood are hardly typical of the rest of the country. what's this entertainment economy doing in the heartland?the answer is: transforming it. burdened by overbuilding, conventional shopping malls - the very malls that previously killed the urban downtown - began dying. fewer than 10 percent of americans shop frequently at malls, down from 16 percent in 1987. even bargain merchandise - the traditional consumer pull - was not enough. whereas typical shoppers each made 2.6 trips per week to the mall in 1994, today they're showing up about 1.7 times every seven days.enter the megaplex-centered mall and the theme-park mall - america's newest downtowns. the mall of america, in bloomington, minnesota, for instance, added an entertainment complex, a walk-through aquarium, and a 7-acre amusement park to lure shoppers. attracting 40 million shoppers a year, it now hosts more visitors than walt disney world, disneyland, and the grand canyon combined. at ontario mills, an outlet center in california, 214 stores are packaged in a facility with an indoor zoo, two ice rinks, and a motion-simulation theater. where the average visitor spends just over an hour at a conventional mall, at ontario mills an average shopper lingers 3.5 hours.while sociologists decry the demise of communities, these parking-lot neighborhoods of stores and entertainment centers are growing faster than any retail phenomenon in our history. the next step in this evolution is to put housing next to the stores and megaplexes and call it a small town - indeed, just as disney has done with its prepackaged living environment, celebration, florida.these multiplexes, megaplexes, and a few truly colossal gigaplexes have spilled over into their surrounding neighborhoods in ways few bond-issue-financed arts centers ever have. the opera, ballet, and concert halls of new york's lincoln center never engendered anything like the window shopping and nightlife that has come into manhattan's upper west side since the sony theatres lincoln square megaplex went up nearby on 68th street. entertainmentization is also helping to revive the consumer economy in harlem. a nine-screen multiplex owned by magic johnson theatres is part of a $65 million redevelopment effort on 125th street that will also include retail shops by disney, hmv, modell's, and old navy.declining urban areas outside the dynamic coastal environments are also being transformed by the entertainment economy. ten years ago, the city of east saint louis, just across the mississippi from saint louis, was a textbook case of rust belt decay: raw sewage in the streets, uncollected trash everywhere, and a bankrupt city government. the municipal debt was so extreme that when a resident won a judgment against the town, he was awarded the deed to one of the government's few tangible assets, city hall.with the arrival of the casino queen riverboat, this impoverished city of 42,000 added 1,200 jobs. more than 3 million people per year now visit east saint louis. the casino and associated taxes generate more than 50 percent of the town's operating budget, which includes a beefed-up police force that has helped cut the city's murder rate, at one time the highest in the nation. obviously, movie theaters and casinos are not a panacea for declining social services, underfinanced schools, teenage pregnancy, and violent crime. but there is no doubt that more jobs, more goods in the stores, and more people enjoying themselves on the streets are all factors in improving the tax base and the general quality of life in areas where it was once assumed that the future held only despair.the rest of the world is not far behind america's entertainment economy. nothing in las vegas surpasses melbourne, australia's crown entertainment complex; at 5.3 million square feet, it has the world's second-largest casino, a 500-room hotel, 25 restaurants, 40 bars, 3 nightclubs, and a 2,000-seat theater. even more impressive is malaysia's grandiloquently named genting, city of entertainment - a resort complex that attracted 10 million visitors last year. gambling halls, convention facilities, golf courses, restaurants, and sports facilities all faithfully replicate the vegas model of an adult theme park. malaysian legislators have agreed to locate the entire national zoo within a three-wood's distance of genting.__ for every job lost in aerospace after the cold war's end, california gained two in entertainment. __elsewhere in the underscreened, undermalled, still-waiting-for-cable world, new ventures are starting on an almost hourly basis. in much the same way that america grew by pushing into new territory while the already domesticated territories consolidated into new cities, so the entertainment economy is settling in new territories around the world. in bangkok, for example, the major cineplex sukhumvit entertainment complex has eight screens, a bowling alley, fast-food restaurants, and the full range of book and music stores that you might find in an omaha, nebraska, multiplex mall - plus a soon-to-be-completed imax dome simulator.paradoxically, while entertainment may be a growth sector in the new world economy, few major entertainment companies are highly - or even marginally - profitable.the most obvious reason is the glut of product in the face of consumers' fragmenting time. a battle is being waged for our attention. there are 10,000 more books published today than five years ago. last year, nearly 30,000 albums were released by the major music labels and independents - of which fewer than 2 percent sold more than 50,000 copies. close to 900 new magazines were launched just last year. in 10 years, the number of feature films released by the major motion picture studios has increased by almost 80 percent. cable television, which only 20 years ago was just a way to deliver the major networks to outlying rural areas, today attracts a prime-time audience share approaching that of the big four broadcast networks - largely because the average cable tv viewer has access to 50 channels, up from only four or five per household two decades ago. twenty-five percent of american households now have internet access, and portals such as yahoo! are creating a burgeoning new category of competition.the fragmentation engendered by new platforms has transformed the economics of industries whose revenue has traditionally derived from amassing eyeballs. many savvy media watchers proclaimed the final seinfeld episode the greatest sitcom of all time. yet the finale's audience of 76.3 million viewers was decisively beaten by the 80.5 million who watched the last episode of cheers in 1993 and pulverized by the 106 million viewers who tuned in for the concluding episode of m*a*s*h in 1983 - a decline of 30 million viewers, even as the total number of television households grew by 16 million.our current oversupplied marketplace is light-years from the days when ownership of media outlets was a sure thing. twenty years ago, warren buffett, whose investments in media companies such as the washington post company and capital cities/abc helped him accumulate one of the century's great fortunes, compared a market-dominant newspaper to an unregulated toll bridge - the newspaper owner could raise advertising rates or subscriber fees as much as he or she wanted. today, an inundated environment has rendered distribution monopolies virtually obsolete. future growth, it is now clear, requires global expansion into less mature markets, diversification into other industries, or - most important of all - major hits.a hit is more than an economic success: it also provides the cultural context in which people see themselves. hits transform mere commerce into a consumerist culture statement. their effect is cumulative and pervasive; the more hits an enterprise produces, the more its suppliers, distributors, and consumers trust it, thus easing its ability to gain continued market access.the reliance on hits, in both entertainment and nonentertainment industries, has been the single most powerful change in the business environment. it has subjected enterprises long accustomed to steady, incremental growth to dramatic swings in earnings. the quest for hits has forced marketing to the forefront of business planning and added an entertainment cycle to the business cycle, in the process ratcheting up consumer expectations and competitive risks. equally important, hits also imply the existence of flops, forcing traditional businesses and their executives to open themselves to the insecurities of hollywood studios.__ ted turner, oprah winfrey - they are the conquistadors of modern business. __in such an environment, businesses will grow more quickly. they will die more quickly, too. i doubt we'll ever again see new restaurant chains like mcdonald's, with 30-year category leadership. nothing could better prove that point than the swift rise and equally rapid demise of theme restaurants such as planet hollywood and rainforest cafe. similarly, nike has overswooshed the world, and now it's no longer cool to wear its logo on your shoes, shirt, and hat - evidenced by its 51 percent drop in earnings during the second quarter of this past year.in entertainment, losing is the norm. most movies lose money. most television shows never make it past their pilot. most books are quickly remaindered. entertainment is a portfolio industry in which some properties perform extraordinarily, but most don't perform at all. to expect companies to escape the new exigencies of doing business in the entertainment marketplace is like hoping that banks will go back to barter.is there any rationale to entertainment as business? only if you look at entertainment properties like an investment portfolio. a well-considered stock portfolio is not a crapshoot. rather, it's a collection of investments, some riskier than others, but all based on rational expectations of future value based on calculations of past performance. a variation on value investing also exists in entertainment. it boils down to this maxim: bet on the talent.throughout the entertainment economy, there's been a power shift away from fast-disappearing distribution monopolies and toward the talent. things have changed considerably from the days when alfred hitchcock imperiously observed, \"i didn't say all actors are cattle. i said actors should be treated like cattle.\" today, at the critical point where content connects with audience, celebrity is the indispensable mediator - and the only universal currency.in this environment, brands are also celebrities. successful businesses need celebrity brands to bring consumers through the door. these stars attract the attention not only of time-starved consumers, but of space-constrained retailers who are seeking whatever edge they can to raise their own thin profit margins. the star might be someone like george clooney or donna karan, or it might be the intel sticker on your pc.the increased importance of dominant brands is shifting investment patterns throughout the economy, putting a new emphasis on hollywood-style marketing and promotion campaigns in industries where expenditures used to be smaller and subject to longer-term budgeting.back in 1990, alfred zeien, who eventually became ceo of gillette, came up with a then-gargantuan $175 million marketing budget for a new razor, the sensor. movie-like prelaunch teaser commercials on the super bowl broadcast kicked off an advertising and marketing blitz. right away, the product grabbed 9 percent of the domestic market, which doubled in the next year and racked up sales in the first five years of more than $1.2 billion.like any hit, the sensor began to run its course. it was time for a sequel. zeien returned to the market in 1998 with an unheard-of $300 million ad and promotional campaign for the mach3. its name fairly shouted its concept: high performance. when the product was launched, the dow jones news service wrote, \"everyone knows that hollywood moguls have mastered the art of creating a buzz in the media. but can anything approaching that kind of buzz be generated for something much more mundane than a movie? judging by gillette's recent razzmatazz introduction of the mach3, the answer appears to be yes.\"zeien's role in nurturing and launching the sensor and the mach3 underscores the unfamiliar role in which many senior business executives are now cast: mogul.a hundred years ago, industrialists and financiers symbolized their age: the carnegies, the mellons, the rockefellers. today, ted turner, sumner redstone, oprah winfrey, and rupert murdoch are the businesspeople who capture the headlines and the popular imagination. they are the conquistadors of modern business. in the same way that staking out claims to huge areas of the globe created great wealth in the past, equally great wealth is coming with their conquest of the emotions, the interest, and the allegiance of the global audience. more than ever, companies - all companies - need nimble, decisive leaders who can about-face in a rapidly changing environment. egotistical, focused, controlling, deeply intuitive, and undaunted by failure, moguls are the absolute - and necessary - monarchs of the entertainment economy.but a modern mogul, at the top of a corporate hierarchy, cannot alone assure success. as consumer businesses come to be differentiated by how effectively they include the e-factor, their fortunes will rise or fall based on their ability to harness creativity at all levels of the organization - in brand development, product replenishment, design, marketing, and communications. adding effective entertainment content is not something that is accomplished merely because a ceo wants it. rather, it is a chimerical, hard-to-define quality. those who can contribute to its creation must be sought out, nurtured, and rewarded.this is easy to understand but hard to do. at successful companies, it's a 24/7 operation. consider gap. it is one of this era's star brands. gap connotes comfortable and casual. gap is cool. and gap creates a new product line every six to eight weeks. reinventing its offering with this frequency - the equivalent of a premi\u00e8re every month and a half - puts tremendous pressure on its designers, window dressers, copywriters, and display architects to come up with clothes, presentations, and a sensibility that connects with the public.swatch also constantly introduces new styles. when swatches first hit the market, they caught on because they were cheap, functional, and beautifully designed. now people are moving to their third, fourth, and fifth swatches. this calls for fresh colors, new shapes, new features, innovative designs. likewise, doll-crazed little girls are never happy with one barbie; they need three or four. that's three or four different wardrobe ensembles and sets of accessories, too.of course, it takes creative talent, up and down the line, to drive success in the entertainment economy. this is a little scary for businesspeople who are accustomed to making their decisions on the basis of spreadsheet analyses. there is no spreadsheet that can predict if the public will prefer one new color over another, one song over another, one film over another, one car design over another. successful companies will be the ones that create talent-friendly environments.but if the human imagination is still the primary asset, it will never again create entertainment merely as an indulgence or an extravagance. indeed, the critical difference between the development of entertainment in such potentially enormous markets as china or india and in the united states is that, in america, entertainment began as a luxury, something that required a lot of discretionary income before people would make purchases of tvs, vcrs, and computers. in the developing world, these items are viewed not as luxuries but rather as necessities for entering the consumer class to which all of the world's masses aspire. thus, the pace of economic entertainmentization is greatly accelerated.here is a number that never ceases to intrigue me. the chinese like to take pictures. but the average mainland chinese household shoots only about half a roll of film a year. if everybody in china who now has a roll of film in a camera finished it and started a new roll this year, worldwide sales of kodak film could double.it gives you an idea of what's waiting around the corner."}
