i'll ask him.__ tom naptonelkhill@ix.netcom.com ____ local asia network __in \"empire of the son\" (wired 7.05, page 160), writer douglas mcgill quotes james liu as saying, \"in the western world, the individual is valued more than the group, so information flows from the group to the individual; in asia it's the opposite.\" it seems to me that richard li's venture is about enabling communication within the group rather than disseminating information via the web. if pacific convergence corporation is successful, it will accelerate the pace of change in china and across asia by tightening the complex relationships that govern the chinese business world.the chinese have always strived to retain their unity across the landmass. li's network will strengthen that sense of nationhood, and will help dispel the myth that economic prosperity demands westernization and the dilution of chinese culture.__ nicky hickmannicky@themorpheusconnection.freeserve.co.uk ____ open-source surgery __i found \"open season\" (wired 7.05 page 140) exciting and informative, if a little brief. open-source software will surpass many commercial systems because it springs from individual passion.however, i take exception to andrew leonard's statement that \"there are plenty of situations in which releasing source code plainly doesn't make good economic sense.\" as an example he cites \"extremely high-value-added programming projects, such as advanced digital-imaging software employed in life-or-death medical procedures.\"our open-source software, the visualization toolkit, is used in precisely these situations - by medical researchers planning surgery on the human brain (brigham & women's hospital) and in national labs simulating nuclear events (los alamos). customers employ our software in part because they know it has been heavily tested around the world, and because they can see, understand, and improve the source code.__ tempest in a teapot __\"powerless\" (wired 7.04, page 118) makes such great copy, with its hypothetical icy wastelands and its future-fact hype (refutable only months after the magazine sells), that it's a wonder wired didn't succumb earlier.i'm from mobile, alabama, where there are more hurricanes than snowstorms. sure, the electricity goes out, but all the stores and gas stations have generators, so it's no big deal. the real problem is, you can't go outside for a day or two without being lifted and thrown into a tree at 80 miles per hour. when the storm is over, there's plenty of gas at the station and money in the bank, but you can't get there, because downed trees and power lines barricade the streets. but we just clean it all up and wait for the next hurricane. we don't kill each other (although we are armed, belligerent rednecks) or go insane.but you're in touch with cobol programmers, so i guess that also makes you experts on civil engineering, group psychology, and prophecy. anyway, it will all be over soon - both y2k and the media virus it has spawned.__ curt cloningercurt@lab404.com ____ planning ahead __in \"50 ways to spend a lot of money\" (wired 7.05, page 81), author david doty includes suspension costs for two cryonics life-extension organizations, cryocare and alcor. to highlight the extravagance, doty doesn't mention that almost every person signed up for these services pays through a life insurance policy that names the suspension organization as the beneficiary. term life insurance policies cost very little. even with alcor's membership fee and $90 quarterly dues, neurosuspension (head-only) comes out to about $40 per month. dying and being suspended is the second worst thing that can happen to you. it makes economic sense to avoid the worst.__ matthew gressmatthew@gress.com ____ undo __false start: according to the white house millennium council, the new millennium begins january 1, 2001 (\"50 ways to spend a lot of money,\" wired 7.05, page 81). ... credit debt: \"suggested reading\" (\"free enterprise,\" wired 7.05, page 146) was compiled by the wired editorial staff, with quips and descriptions from paul boutin. ... loud and proud: dave fitches and dave burlovich, pictured to the left and right of biglex in \"shout it out\" (wired 7.06, page 190), are from loudfactory. ... close call: virtual ink's phone number is +1 (617) 623 8387 (\"high marks,\" wired 7.06, page 70).__ send your rants & raves to: __email: rants@wiredmag.comsnail mail: wired, po box 191826 san francisco, ca 94109-9866editorial guidelines: guidelines@wiredmag.comeditorial correspondence: editor@wiredmag.com"}
