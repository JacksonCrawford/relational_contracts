the american society of composers, artists, and publishers thinks so. by polly sprenger.", "author": "polly sprenger", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "07.01.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "when the kinks sang \"you can't stop the music\" in 1975, they clearly weren't talking about the american society of composers, artists, and songwriters. ascap, an organization that collects licensing fees for musical performances, is asking webmasters to pay for the right to link to online music, even if it is stored on another site.rather than pay up and deal with the hassle, the webmasters are booting the tunes, or links, off their own sites.\"they are like the mafia when it comes to music,\" julian cook, ceo of travelfinder.com, said tuesday. ascap asked him to pay a fee simply for linking to other musical sites when \"all we had here was a page that had links to radio stations.\"ascap said it appeared travelfinder.com was hosting the musical broadcast, since cook linked to the sites through a frame on his page. while the outside menu bar was travelfinder's, the actual broadcasts were from elsewhere.cook first heard from ascap in january and received several more letters in march. in response, he told the organization he had not archived any music, that his site only linked to radio station sites. last month, however, he was notified that his site could be subject to legal action.\"we have sent numerous letters to your organization offering a license agreement which would authorize public performance of musical works in the ascap repertory at your web site,\" the letter said. \"to date, your site remains unauthorized.\"cook said he felt the letter amounted to a cease-and-desist order, and he removed the music links from his site.under its own mandate, ascap doesn't have the authority to stop cook from publishing the links without a court order. according to chris amenica, assistant vice president of new media and technology at ascap, the letter was simply an offer for a license.\"if somebody doesn't like our rates, they can take us to court and we can have a rate court proceeding. we're not saying to mr. cook, 'take it down or we'll put you out of business.' all we've done is explain our position,\" amenica said.but cook likens the offer to a protection racket, saying he didn't know that ascap had to justify its rates to the court.\"it's a mafia-type shakedown,\" cook fumed, saying that the original letter said ascap had had to \"reluctantly file its first copyright infringement lawsuit against a major web site operator who refused to enter into an ascap license agreement and did not obtain the proper authorization.\"the group operates under a 1950 antitrust consent decree, which states that if ascap and prospective licensees can't agree on a license fee, a reasonable fee will be set by the federal courts.the group has been chastised before for bullying tactics, with one case filed in new york under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act for mailing brochures to potential licensees \"containing false and misleading statements of fact.\" in 1996, ascap came under critical fire for mailing 6,000 letters to summer camps across the country, insisting that they pay licensing fees for songs sung or performed in a public forum. the media at the time painted a picture of girl scouts silenced around their campfires, unable to sing popular tunes.the group has had a longtime face-off with restaurants across the country for forcing them to pay licensing fees to have tvs and radios turned on for diners.a 1993 article in restaurant business magazine cited similar tactics in ascap's licensing efforts for that industry.\"the state restaurant associations have long advised their members to pay the few hundred dollars in licensing fees rather than risk a lawsuit or fines that could easily cost thousands. alone, fines for copyright infringement range from us$500 to $10,000,\" the magazine reported.\"we're not saying we're taking everyone and their brother to court,\" amenica said. \"we try to settle these things amicably so there isn't that need or expense on both sides.\"but like small restaurant owners, most web sites could not afford a $10,000 lawsuit, cook said.amenica said ascap has been successful in requiring retail outlets that play a radio in their shops to pay the licensing fee, and doesn't see why web outlets should be any different.\"it hasn't been tested yet [in the courts], but when you look at who benefits from the performance, it's the same thing as a retail establishment,\" amenica said. \"all we're looking for is a fair value for exploitation of our members' rights.\"cook argues that links to music stored elsewhere on the net shouldn't make a web site liable for fees, but amenica said that the issue is cloudier than that.\"linking does present certain issues, no doubt about it,\" he said, adding that the group is currently pursuing only sites whose musical links appear to be local to the site, even if those links actually lead to a different server.\"if [the links] take you off a particular web site, right now we're not pursuing that at all,\" amenica said."}
