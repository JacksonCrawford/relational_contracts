they're a consumer-marketing company!\" the object of such an outfit, he adds, \"is to maximize your marketing opportunities and revenue, and minimize your content costs.\"online newsletter publisher robert seidman, whose power as a pundit comes from the fact that steve case returns his emails, figured out who the real victims of this deal were. \"aol and netscape, just in advertising and commerce revenues, are pulling in more revenue than yahoo!, excite, lycos, and infoseek - combined! combined! yowsa.\" (seidman is the only pundit i know who would say \"yowsa\" about anything.)a different conclusion altogether was drawn by the news-weary denise caruso, who wrote in her new york times column that \"the merger announcement was a classic tactic for a cynical industry. many such announcements have been made over the last decade or so, and despite the vast media coverage they engender, most do not work and are quietly dismantled later, when their public relations value has waned.\" caruso's jadedness can sound almost refreshing in the happy-face world of silicon valley.so what happens next? in recent months aol has offered descriptions of two projects now under way, one - aoltv - aimed at the high-bandwidth market also sought by @home and webtv, the other - \"aol anywhere\" - aimed at ubiquity. the former, at the moment, is a plan to market aol-branded set-top boxes so you can instant-message your buddy list via your tv. the latter sounds more like a marketing memo in search of a product.in the face of a future riddled with uncertainty, the company will continue to place money on its surest bet yet - audience. it's the one slogan recited at aol today that carries any weight: we've got eyeballs.must readdbs studrules are for making$25 million manjargon watchimproving your replove among the press releasesdna scan-o-maticmultiply and conquerfarber's almanac$4.2 billion in eyeballswhat's on aol tonite?it's 1995 all over again!product (re)placementpeopletomorrow todayisps? so 10 minutes agodivine callinghype listnuking nukesgiving it awaytired/wiredchina's os rebellionraw data"}
