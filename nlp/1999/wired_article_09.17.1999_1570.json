[but] must we feel guilty if we cannot be satisfied doing nothing?\" perhaps, he writes, we're just becoming better at absorbing the vast amounts of data streaming at us. or maybe not.faster is no balm for modernity. gleick describes the symptoms of what he calls hurry sickness, but he follows up with this: \"multitasking has been our destiny all along -- not killing time, not doing time, but mastering time...\"he never quite comes out and says what we think he'll say next, something like, \"rebel! you have nothing to lose but your chains.\" nor does gleick offer much advice on how to cope.in fact, he spends a couple of chapters mocking the whole time-saving industry and its time-sucking books like 365 ways to save time and more time for sex.the main message seems to be that humans must choose carefully how to spend each ticking second. maybe we just have to deal.gleick guesses the future will look something like terry gilliam's film brazil: \"a dark hodgepodge of the antique and futuristic ... not shiny and gleaming ... [but] all mixed up like a junkyard, the old and the new jumbled in together. your cellular phone and your portable cd player ... rest on the shelf next to a 1950s cellophane tape dispenser that somehow never got replaced.\"the final paradox is that faster sometimes means slower: web sites crash. freeways bottleneck. even faster itself, with its short chapters and streamlined prose, requires time to absorb."}
