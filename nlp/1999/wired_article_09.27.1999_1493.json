(vphm), on 1,024 cold patients aged 14 and older.half got pleconaril and half got a dummy pill.the patients who got the drug had a serious form of the cold known as viral respiratory infection (vri), whose symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, muscle aches, and tiredness.it can spread to the sinuses or lower respiratory tract, causing middle ear infection (otitis media), sinusitis, respiratory distress, croup, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia.most vri infections are caused by rhinoviruses or enteroviruses.the patients who got the drug were ill for an average of 10.5 days, while those who got a dummy pill were ill for 14 days, hayden told a meeting of the interscience conference on antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy (icaac).the drug seemed very safe, with the same numbers of patients in both groups reporting side-effects such as diarrhea and abdominal pain.other studies have shown that pleconaril can reduce the course of a viral meningitis infection by two to three days.the drug is still in phase ii studies, -- meant to show a compound is safe and to start determining how well it works.future tests known as phase iii trials must be finished before a company can apply for us food and drug administration (fda) approval.copyright"}
