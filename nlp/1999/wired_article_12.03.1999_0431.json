sped toward the red planet, putting it on track for a pinpoint landing on the martian south polar region. after an 11-month voyage across the solar system, nasa scientists predicted that the craft would touch down on a smooth area of the frozen tundra to begin its search for water and unlock other secrets of mars.\"an 8-second burn was performed at 5:39 a.m. pst to slightly change the lander's trajectory. the flight crew thought the angle it was coming in at was too sharp so they made it a bit more shallow. the sharper angle was acceptable for landing but they wanted to correct it just to be on the safe side,\" said a spokesman for the jet propulsion laboratory (jpl) in pasadena.the lander, a gawky, 1,270 pound craft equipped with a robotic arm, radio antennae, imaging devices, and solar panels for power, was scheduled to dive through the thin martian atmosphere just after noon pst on friday before a parachute and retro-rockets break the fall and set it gently down on a barren steppe near the planet's south polar ice cap.\"we're doing something that is truly historic, and it's a lot like the antarctic expeditions. this is not business as usual,\" said bruce murray of the california institute of technology, part of the scientific team assembled at nasa's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena as mission control for the mars lander project.the main mission of the lander and the two basketball-sized probes that will separately punch their way into the martian surface is to look for signs of water ice and clues about whether earth's nearest neighbor might ever have had a climate capable of supporting life.if found, large underground ice deposits could also prove invaluable for future human missions to mars, providing both water to drink and the raw material for fuel, scientists say.\"that could make the process of eventually settling on mars that much easier,\" said david paige of the university of california, los angeles, one of the chief scientific investigators on the project.but the lander mission also has other goals, including delivering new up-close images of the martian surface and, for the first time, relaying back to earth the actual sounds of mars via a small microphone.but before the scientific payoff, flight engineers must first bring the lander safely to the ground.in the final hours before it hits the martian atmosphere, the spacecraft will receive its final course instructions and begin its own preparations for landing, which include jettisoning its protective \"cruise ring\" and the two probes, and positioning itself so that its heat shield bears the brunt of the ferocious 3,000 degree fahrenheit friction generated as it hurtles through the martian atmosphere.once on the ground, the craft will pause to let the dust settle and then slowly extend the solar panels that will give it power. it will also extend its primary antenna to sweep the sky, seeking contact with earth.scientists say that if all goes well, the first signals from mars could come through by about 12:40 p.m. pst and last for about 45 minutes. after that, the spacecraft will shut down for about five hours while it recharges.later on friday, it is scheduled to begin a series of transmissions to earth and to receive its first instructions. but scientists cautioned that it may take some time -- or even days -- for the lander to establish a viable communication link and that silence from mars after the initial landing should not be interpreted as failure.\"there is still a very real possibility that we may not hear anything during that whole period of time,\" said richard cook, project manager for operations.once communication has been established and the scientific team is satisfied that all elements of the lander are working properly, it will be ready to begin its investigative mission. scientists say that perhaps as early as tuesday, its 6-foot robotic arm could be extended to grab a handful of martian soil, which will be baked in tiny ovens to check for water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other gases.if they survive their own shattering crash landings on the martian surface, the two microprobes, dubbed amundsen and scott after the first explorers to reach the south pole on earth, will also take soil samples.the mars polar lander is important to the us space program for a number of reasons, not least as a chance to move beyond the embarrassing loss of another mars project, the climate orbiter, just 10 weeks ago.but it is also another important test of nasa's new strategy of relying on small, unmanned, and -- at a total cost of about $265 million -- relatively inexpensive spacecraft to gather basic information about earth's neighbors.when, if all goes according to plan, the lander's robotic arm reaches out and grabs a handful of martian dust, it will mark a breakthrough in humanity's effort to understand the cosmos, said murray of caltech.\"one person's dirt is another person's gold.\""}
