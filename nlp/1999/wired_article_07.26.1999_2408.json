shouldn't you be doing something else?\"not every engineer goes into management, and not every engineer makes millions off an ipo and retires early. most engineers have to keep working. kostek says america will have a hard time attracting people to the profession, if the industry continues to push people out earlier and earlier.the hard-luck stories of older engineers annoy the heck out of 75-year-old bill payson, president and ceo of seniortechs, an internet-based registry of 16,000 vintage techies. vintage means anyone over 35.payson started seniortechs in 1998 when he heard about the estimated 346,000 it job vacancies, as reported by the information technology association of america. the number of openings is expected to grow, and there aren't enough recent graduates to fill them. payson wants it companies to hire the people in his registry, who are anxious to work again.many registrants have had experiences like larry larsen, who spent years in silicon valley's semiconductor industry. larsen quit his job several years ago to join an internet startup. when the venture failed, larsen decided to go back to semiconductors.\"i thought i'd just pop right back in,\" said larsen. \"but zippo. most of the time i never got any response from my r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\"age bias is often subtle and frequently impossible to prove. human resource departments deny the problem exists, and when an older candidate is turned down, many other reasons besides age discrimination are offered to account for it. when pressed, recruiters admit to three reasons for not hiring older workers: rusty skills, an inflated idea of worth, and \"old-fashioned ways of thinking.\"not surprisingly, seniortech's slogan is: \"when skills are current all ages are equal.\"payson urges older techies to upgrade their skills. seniortech has joined forces with cbt systems, which offers more than a thousand interactive courses over the internet. seniortech has also struck a second partnership with the online bookseller fatbrain.com, which supplies texts geared to technical professionals. employers, who pay for seniortech's services, are encouraged to reimburse the vintage techie for retraining.why so many engineers have let their skills grow stale is a mystery to bill payson.\"this is part of the paradox of high tech, which is supposed to be such a forward-thinking industry,\" said payson. \"they apparently aren't thinking in terms of constant education.\"not everybody over a certain age is doomed to sitting by a silent phone. nonstop solutions, a san francisco-based startup, boasts a decidedly mature engineering staff: the average age is 39.\"we're like plants,\" said dan galvin, vice president of product design and one of nonstop's founders. \"you have to repot yourself from time to time by going off into different areas. you have to keep your technology fresh so you can avoid going stale on the shelf.\"among other things, galvin helped to develop one of the first package-tracking systems for federal express and the first commercial deployment of optical laser discs for the library of congress.nonstop says customers not only get cutting-edge design, but the engineering team's deep domain expertise.\"i already have the arrows in my ass that many people who've been in the business for five years still have to acquire,\" chuckled al hadsell, nonstop's 50-year-old director of technology planning.hadsell's arrow was painful indeed. while testing an automated system that directed a 40-ton crane, hadsell found a bug in his code. by then the crane had crashed through the wall of a detroit auto plant and smashed a chevy. no one was hurt, but hadsell makes sure his new customers benefit from his old mistakes."}
