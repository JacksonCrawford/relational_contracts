[best if read aloud in a late-show announcer type voice.] we're just a bunch of folks who want to make the process of buying textbooks a lot less painful.\" says vp of merchandise marketing jade roth, \"we're very interested in getting the product out there, not the barnes & noble brand name.\"follett's strategy to shore up its brick-and-mortar constituency is to erase the distinction between in-store and online purchases altogether. students can reserve texts on the campus bookshop's web site, and in many cases, filled orders can be picked up at the store an hour later. \"we're tying the bricks to the bytes, which allows the bookstores to not be disintermediated,\" effuses jim baumann, president of follett's higher education group. bundling bricks and bytes, however, can be a drag on ecommerce. the primary efollett.com url is little more than a national brand name pasted over a network of individual sites, with the book prices themselves buried many clicks deep.of the four sites, the one that speaks to kids in their own language without sounding like dad doing maynard gen-x krebs is bigwords - not surprising, given that ceo matt johnson is 24. unlike varsitybooks.com, which relies on a single distributor, bigwords has recast the textbook supply chain for ecommerce, rallying 500-plus publishers and suppliers behind its service. as efollett.com revs up a $10 million tv ad blitz for august, bigwords boasts a \"tell a friend\" program giving discounts to students whose buddies buy books on the site and word of mouth that's bringing in orders from the czech republic and azerbaijan.score one for the great leveler. \"everybody's on an even playing field now,\" barnes & noble's roth concedes. \"the battle will be fought this fall.\""}
