the darker side that ruins far more people than it makes.i found an exit window from the \"it's never enough\" stress mill. my family and i moved to south america, where i have time to live, to enjoy every day, and to play with my son while he grows up.ever the entrepreneur, i still find it impossible to stop working, but at least here - away from the traffic, stress, rush-rush - we can enjoy our lives rather than become another statistic. in the age of telecommuting, you can work anywhere. it might not be easy, but the alternative is twice as hard.__ zacharias j. beckmanzbeckman@creativesun.com ____ air time __like banks and telcos, airlines have a problem: the better their products and services get, the less consumers notice and appreciate them (\"life sucks and then you fly,\" wired 7.08, page 156). unfortunately, airlines have an additional handicap: baby boomers are old enough to remember the glamour era of air travel, when fares were regulated and airlines competed on service. today, the first and usually only consideration in purchasing a ticket is price. and those middle-aged boomers refuse to accept the fact that both they and the airline industry have grown up.still, the wired article reflects only the first circle of air travel hell. the lowest depths of evil and despair can be described only by airline employees, who must endure never-ending abuse from bratty passengers who think throwing in-flight temper tantrums (\"air rage\") is a performing art that could someday win them an academy award.__ gerry smedinghoffgerrysmedinghoff@worldnet.att.net __according to \"seven days on the vapor trail with the hyper class\" (wired 7.08, page 160), tom peters logs 1 million miles annually.assume that peters' year includes two weeks of vacation. in the work time remaining, he'd have to log 20,000 miles a week, or 3,000 miles a day monday through saturday and 2,000 miles on sunday, when he takes it easy.peters must be in pursuit of something other than excellence if he's spending more time in the air than flight attendant michael holcomb, who logs 600,000 miles.__ michael boltonmbolton@earthlink.net ____ tainted love __i commend wired and writer david diamond for presenting the facts in \"james gleick's survival lessons\" (wired 7.08, page 78). early in the article i thought i smelled irony: diamond discusses tainted truths, the book by gleick's wife on how statistics can be used to distort reality. since few groups massage statistics like the media, when the article turned to experimental aircraft i thought diamond would fall into the usual misinformed drivel. he didn't.at the time of gleick's accident, diamond writes, some in the new york media questioned whether flying was \"the wisest father-son hobby.\" i have been flying with my father since i was 5 years old (he flies for fun; i now fly professionally, which also happens to be fun). our time in the air together counts among the happiest and most wisely spent hours of our lives. whatever i am doing when i die, i hope i'm having as much fun. unfortunately, statistics show that i probably won't be flying when it happens.__ tom chandler74742.1126@compuserve.com ____ qubemania __i got a kick out of janice maloney's profile of steve perlman, webtv's refuse-to-get-old founder (\"perlmania,\" wired 7.07, page 102). maloney credits webtv networks for being the first company to make good on the promise of interactive television.if she's referring to the concept of interactive tv in the era of the mainstream internet, she's correct. but the first foray into interactive television ever, as many columbus, ohio, residents remember, was the qube system, sold by warner communications in 1977.as an 8-year-old, i requested music videos, competed in trivia contests with my family against other qube families, and even ordered movies. all, believe it or not, in real time. qube spread to four more cities by cable before its demise in 1983 - and no doubt inspired many qube kids to become new media professionals.__ steve susissusi@digitalpulp.com ____ visions of cyprus __i am a turkish citizen living in washington, dc, and a muslim, and i loved \"one nation, invisible\" (wired 7.08, page 92). it is rare for a so-called westerner to write such a plainly true and analytical essay on turkish peoples and muslims. as the daughter of a soldier who fought in the undeclared war in cyprus in 1974, i want to thank bruce sterling for being a sincere and true journalist.__ yasemin bayraktarbyasemin@yahoo.com __before reading bruce sterling's wonderfully visceral, sardonic, and chilling essay, i had only a fragmentary understanding of cyprus: an island with an ancient history split in two by an ethnic feud between modern greeks and modern turks, who never cared much for one another anyway. the island now exists in my mind, and i understand part of the world better. thank you.__ gabriel fenteanyfenteany@zk.bwh.harvard.edu ____ big brother on board __todd lappin's \"the new road rage\" (wired 7.07, page 126) told one side of the story of automobile telematics. the other could be big brother.say there's an arrest warrant out for a bill douglas. the fbi legally requires gm's onstar to divulge its subscriber names and locations. sure enough, gm has a william o. douglas, so the fbi contacts the local constable, and \"bill douglas\" is hauled in.of course, mistaken identity is an old story, but it could happen even more with telematics. and people running from the law will likely buy onstar-equipped cars using false ids anyway.the law-enforcement issue aside, having your location tracked is a double-edged sword: could the irs use onstar to execute a tax lien? could a gang member use onstar to hunt down a rival?__ jeff gettlemanjeffg@examco.com ____ family ties __as a rabid genealogist who's also married to one - cyndi howells of cyndi's list (www.cyndislist.com) - i was looking forward to \"databases of the dead\" (wired 7.07, page 134).when i read internet-genealogy articles in the mass media, i usually get a few chuckles. writers rarely spend enough time understanding the innards of the community. but your piece was spot-on with its descriptions, explanations, and spin on the various elements of our world, both online and off. i am recommending it to both my genealogy and non-genealogy friends as an excellent description of the field today.__ mark howellsmarkhow@oz.net ____ half-reality check __reading \"belonging\" (wired 7.06, page 166), i couldn't help thinking that had muktha been a lifelong resident of india, and had marcelo moved from corrientes to uc berkeley, their positions might have been reversed. of course, they're both right and wrong. marcelo sees the appealing attributes of the net, while muktha focuses on its less positive sides.the exchange was sublime, in that it addressed the dilemmas faced by every society in this wired, networked world, where a dominant culture seeks to subvert real differences among societies by imposing, as muktha puts it, \"technology-mediated half-realities.\" but this charge or accusation cannot be leveled at the net exclusively. for \"technology-mediated half-reality\" substitute \"hollywood-mediated total fantasy\" or even \"colonialism.\"the net is a positive force, and liberation from the tyranny of space is its greatest benefit. the net - more than anything else - enables you to exist in the social milieu of your childhood. if reading the hindu with your morning cup of filter coffee is your thing (as it is mine), the net indulges whether you're in antarctica, hong kong, or chennai. and you're but an email away from kith, kin, and childhood friends. in addition, the net offers all the extras that have enriched marcelo's intellectual development. in a nutshell, then, i have to agree that the net is underhyped, even by the optimists.__ vijay chander, hong kongvijay.chander@prudential.com ____ undo __freezer burn: electrolux, the maker of the net-fridge mentioned in \"express lane\" (wired 7.05, page 112), is based in sweden. ... air fare: boeing-financed ellipso expects to offer broadband services in 2003. also, skybridge's general funding partner is alcatel (\"carving up the pie in the sky,\" wired 7.06, page 209).__ send your rants & raves to: __email: rants@wiredmag.comsnail mail: wired, po box 191826 san francisco, ca 94109-9866editorial guidelines: guidelines@wiredmag.comeditorial correspondence: editor@wiredmag.com"}
