techies. the long hours required to succeed in a booming industry mean few hours left over for dating and relationships, leaving many with raging careers and utterly flaccid personal lives. see also: high-end tech company perks\"for the last nine years, i have failed to hold down a long-term relationship,\" said jeremiah, chief architect for a san francisco internet infrastructure company.not-so-coincidentally, jeremiah's nine years of singledom have coincided with his years working as a software designer. jeremiah, whose typical week includes about 65 hours of work, said he simply has no time for romance.\"when you don't have enough time for yourself, making time for another person becomes another chore, another stress to worry about,\" he said.chai, a 28-year-old san francisco interior design saleswoman, said she and her programmer boyfriend had no sex at all when he was working as an employee instead of a contractor.\"nine months into our relationship, the sex started to dwindle,\" chai said. \"at the beginning of our relationship, we were having sex three times a week. during the employee stage -- which lasted one year and three months -- we had no sex at all.\"chai blames her relationship problems on the never-ending worklife of a techie.\"people who are coding and working on a new release will sometimes work two or three weeks, working every minute just to get the product out the door,\" chai said. \"it is all-consuming. you don't care how clean things are, what you eat, how you look. it is pretty common of computer geeks to lead an extremely hectic lifestyle, and this would put strains on any relationship.\"the phenomenon is so common that sex advice columnist dan savage devoted an entire column to the plight of undersexed \"microsofties\". but the problem isn't only endemic to microsoft.people who doubt the problem exists need only check yahoo personals to find a vast outcry from \u00fcber-busy, lovelorn geeks.the problem is particularly widespread among people running their own start-ups. mindful of the failure rate of new companies, geeks trying to give birth to a healthy baby company put in long work weeks that leave no time for sleep or food, much less sex and love. john smith works anywhere from 70 to 100 hours a week in his four-person internet start-up and blames his single status on an utter lack of time.\"there is always enormous pressure in this industry to perform, put in the hours, move fast and with flexibility,\" smith said. \"however, when you are working for someone else the stress level is high but considerably lower than trying to launch your own baby. most ventures fail early on, and you have to fight, fight, fight to make your business a reality. it is an emotional sausage grinder.\"dr. william fitzgerald, who specializes in marital and sexual therapy at the silicon valley relationship and sexuality center, has heard plenty of similar horror stories from his clients, about 20 percent of whom hail from the tech industry.\"a higher percentage of computer professionals come in with socialization issues,\" fitzgerald said. \"the majority of those coming in are men aged 25 to 40, single, and they have problems with dating. to a large extent, they have a lack of sexual skills, don't know how to talk to women, and are clueless as to the step-to-step progression of dating.\"\"a significant number of them are virgins, or their only sexual experience has been with a prostitute,\" fitzgerald continued. \"they have all these fantasized ideas as to why this is going on, such as 'i don't have time to do these stupid things that girls demand to date them ... women want mushy stuff like candy, flowers, and candlelit dinners.' i respond to that by saying if you want the sex, you have to provide what she wants in return: love, affection, and attention.\"but to a coder pushing hard to ship product or squash bugs in the latest release, the time and energy it takes to work on a healthy relationship is far down the to-do list.lack of lovey-dovey time is certainly not unique to the tech industry. workers in any industry that requires long hours notice a downturn in sexual relationships.\"i hear about similar problems from my colleagues who deal with high-pressured new york financial executives, for example,\" fitzgerald said. \"i don't think it is unique to the computer industry. stockbrokers often have the same sort of libido problems, who are also in the same young age group of 25 to 40.\"\"exhaustion and frustration from work will kill anybody's libido,\" said \"ask isadora\" columnist isadora alman, who sees the problem as more of an endemic lack of balance between work time and personal time rather than a geek-specific concern.dr. fitzgerald said, however, that techies have certain relationship problems that other professionals lack.\"i think that the majority of computer workers are very bright, and in high school they were pursuing intellectual pursuits instead of dating,\" fitzgerald said. \"while their better-rounded counterparts were having initial sexual experiences, these guys were developing new computer programs or getting major rewards from intellectual pursuits. by contrast, guys of average intelligence were more into sports, drinking beer, and getting laid, and therefore were better socialized in regards to dating and sexuality.\"in other words, while everyone else was dancing at the prom, geeks were operating the audio-visual equipment in the corner. fitzgerald also said that easy internet access to porn exacerbates techie isolation.\"the internet makes it imminently easy for these guys to look at pornography and masturbate. that's quicker than devoting the time to wine and dine their significant other to have consensual intercourse,\" fitzgerald said.one-handed typing and adult content makes for a quick 'n' easy sexual release but it's no substitute for a loving relationship, fitzgerald said.people who give up a fulfilling personal life for monetary and career rewards will likely regret their choice, while those who strive for a balance may not rise as high in the career firmament but will ultimately be more satisfied.in the meantime, an army of valley employees substitute career ambitions for a personal life and dream of future days when they'll have free time again.\"life is short,\" said smith, who plans to cut back on his work time just as soon as his company is launched. \"pursuing your dreams, whether work-related or otherwise, and finding love are the real gold at the end of the rainbow. money provides comfort, flexibility, and pride, but all by itself, money can deliver only a shallow kind of happiness.\"editor's note: the names and identifying characteristics
