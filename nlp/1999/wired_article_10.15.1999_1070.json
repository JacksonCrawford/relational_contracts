it ain't the recording industry. it\u2019s the manufacturer.\"but sdmi executive director leonardo chiariglione provided another scenario that involved the offering of innovative, price-cutting marketing schemes.\"many people say, 'i'd like to listen to this four or five times. then i don't care.' it's interesting to say, '[then] pay 30 percent less.'\"chiariglione defended the sdmi discussions, saying they were moving along more quickly than other similar negotiations related to industry standards. he also promised that a consensus would be reached.when sdmi launched in december 1998, it aimed to get its security into music players by this holiday season. the so-called phase 1 -- which includes a watermark trigger informing the user of the phase 2 sdmi-compliant software availability -- came out for portable devices last july.the watermarking technology was developed by aris technologies, which announced in a 27 september press release that it would begin shipping software development kits.another contentious issue involves the possibility of content owners paying for the watermarking of every song they would make available, even if none ended up being downloaded or sold, a source involved in the sdmi discussions said.but an sdmi proponent insisted the two sides are trying to come up with an equitable way to work out the licensing fees and satisfy all parties.aris' president david leibowitz said that people would have to pay for every song they encode, but said the encoding is voluntary.he added, \"we're trying to set up a system that would not impose an unreasonable financial burden\" on any of the players, especially the smaller ones.leibowitz said thursday he hoped to get the final licensing terms worked out at next week's sdmi meeting in kyoto, japan. he also mentioned that some music-player manufacturers whom he declined to name were still \"hopeful\" to produce phase 1 players by the holidays.neither diamond nor thomson said they would offer players with phase 1 technology before january.\"there's as much sdmi in [the rio 500] as we can build today,\" diamond official mike reed said.the rio 500 is upgradeable and its next incarnation will support liquid audio and microsoft's windows media format in addition to mp3, he said.creative labs executive chris smith said the company hopes to ship its second-generation nomad with watermarking by the end of the year. \"i wouldn't want to make a strong statement [because] there's some possibility that the technology won't come together,\" he said. \"our retail partners usually need a lot more lead time.\"sony also expressed minor frustration with sdmi's progress. \"would anyone like to be sooner?\" asked sony executive rich armstrong. \"yes, but given there are 120 people [participating] in sdmi, things are going well. these are minor hiccups in the road.\"still, he added, \"we're on schedule,\" referring to the january release of its memory stick walkman.the walkman -- like the rio and the lyra -- is ready to accept any changes via a software download. the device will initially support mp3 and atrac3 -- sony's own format, and will support others as they become popular.meanwhile, the recording industry awaits the meeting of the sdmi minds; a sony official said the company wouldn't release many new tracks until sdmi compliant devices are ready.until now, the major labels have resisted putting very much popular content on the internet, but when they do, it's likely to become wildly popular.obviously, some observers saw the holiday goal as a chance for the big labels to gain market share in an industry that remains wide open.according to pc data, fewer than 30,000 rios and nomads -- about us$4.79 million worth -- were sold from december through august.still, sdmi's chiariglione said the holiday deadline is \"more symbolic. i don't think it's really an issue.\"besides, he added, the portable specification has been out since last july, and that device makers could have designed their product so that the watermarking technology could be added when the phase 2 kit became available.but forrester's hardie argues that there's no need to panic because the player market is still in its infancy. \"the overriding effort is to get a device that works,\" he said. \"the market is embryonic.\""}
