percent of the company.lycos is mum as to who it may be talking to in this regard, but the rumor mill places german media titan bertelsmann high on the list. other frequently mentioned prospects include microsoft, cbs, time warner, and news corp.online ad agency doubleclick (dclk) gained $9.88 to $97.63 after signing a three-year contract to continue selling ads on compaq computer's alta
