well, yeah, sure, universally available operating systems are something for everyone with a computer to think about.read ongoing linux coverage - - - - - -much more potentially sweeping is the idea of linking people from all over the world via mailing lists and web site posts and assembling them somewhere to pursue their common fixation over beers, beers, and more beers. the hiking part, great in theory, has taken a back seat to other pursuits, given all the sitting that the assembled computer nuts are accustomed to doing.\"ten years ago, this would have been great fun, but now it's just exhausting,\" said one red-faced member of the group as he neared the top of a spike-shaped peak of rock rising several hundred meters above the pension where many of the lbw (linuxbierwanderung) crowd was staying.\"i came here to do the walking, the beer, and the linux, but not necessarily in that order,\" said john smith, a programmer from the south of england who heard about lbw from german friends.\"i'd say i've enjoyed the beer most, followed closely by linux. i've been sampling every bavarian beer i can find. we've worked our way all the way down the list of beers at our pension, and started again at the top. we might need to send a search party to the next village, pottenstein, to find a few new beers for us to try.\"long gone are the days when people obsessed with computers felt branded as social outcasts. even so, there's a payoff to putting names with faces and leaning over the laptop together hour after hour that many here would gladly travel even farther to experience. \"i like beer, i like hiking, and i like computing,\" said henrik levkowetz, a stockholm-based systems consultant who drove his bmw to the event.\"at home, if i go out with my friends and i talk too much about computing, they say 'ok, that's enough, please go home.' but here everyone talks about computing all the time.\"there are plenty of time zones represented here. leonid kirillov, a key organizer of the event, was held up in russia because of visa problems. he plans to arrive this weekend.people from germany, england, the netherlands, italy, sweden, canada, the united states, new zealand, and scotland have all gathered. some are camping, some staying at the pension.\"in the beginning, the idea was 'let's go to bavaria. they have the best beer in the world, and we can do some hiking and have an interchange of ideas,'\" said organizer reinald kirchner, from the cologne area, who scouted locations in the area around pottenstein.scotland has emerged as one choice for next year's linux beer hike, although others are pushing for madagascar, so that eclipse-viewing can again be part of the entertainment. this year, suse, a linux distributor, paid for a bus and the whole lbw crew headed south for wednesday's total eclipse.bavaria may be a hard act to follow, and not just because of the robust offering of beer, which has been a big hit.the hub of activity at the camp is a green-and-white plastic pavilion set up in a meadow a few paces away from a narrow, deep creek, surrounded by tents and, in the distance, slopes thick with young pine trees.a hand-made sign (duct-taped, naturally) alerts motorists on the passing, winding country road that this is a \"linux!\" gathering, but the talk sounds much like what you would hear at any other camp. almost. a boy puts a little too much leg into kicking a soccer ball, and smashes a lamp. he is scolded \"that could have been a laptop!\" soon it's back to swatting at yellow-jackets, and asking questions like \"what's the difference between tcp and udp?\"alexander maddalena, from moscow, hitchhiked from munich, by way of italy, and impressed one and all with his russian-italian accented english exclamations, chiefly \"wow!\"shane lazarus of new zealand won longest-commute honors (27 hours in the air just to get to germany) and albert and lois hybel had the best story. they combined the hiking-and-beer week with a trip to the czech republic and slovakia for an extended tutorial in folk dance. they report that the czech style is slower and easier than the slovak style.\"i kind of lost a culture,\" said albert, 67, whose mother was born in the czech republic. \"we came to europe primarily to go to the czech republic for dance lessons and to re-establish ties with some family members of mine.\"and of course there was the beer. albert, who works as y2k adviser to the university of maryland medical school dean's office, learned to love german beer in the service back in the 1950s, an affection that endures.opinions ran stronger on beer than they did on linux, whose virtues were universally celebrated. marco homann of hamburg did not actually assert that all beer brewed in southern germany should be used to wash laundry, but he curled up his face in a pained way at the taste of it.\"here in the south, the beer is too sweet,\" he explained. \"i don't like it so much. i think you should make beer of barley, not wheat.\"when it came to random conversations along the trail, or at the cybercaf\u00e9 an hour away in nurenberg, where many were going to check their email, topic a was where the 2000 gathering would be. no one was thinking about technology when they lobbed out a choice, just beer.\"i don't even know if they have beer in madagascar, so that takes more research,\" said levkowetz, the swede. \"sooner or later, it would be nice to have it in the states, somewhere where they have a lot of microbreweries.\"otherwise, it would be nice to have a tradition where every year we tried to watch an eclipse. and sooner or later, we will have to visit both ireland and england for the beer. and the netherlands and belgium. there are a lot of beer countries.\""}
