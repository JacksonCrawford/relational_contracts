even moving. under the guidance of paul hillier and joined by organist christopher bowers-broadbent, theatre of voices gives a stunning performance marked by clear, vibrato-less voices and impeccable musicianship.macy grayon how life is (sony/epic)vocalist macy gray's debut is pure pleasure. she has the rasp, that scuffed-up timbre you're either born with or not. tina turner and joe cocker have it, and alex chilton had it on \"the letter.\" imagine a female rod stewart (with the tenderness rod could once summon), and you've got macy gray. every song flows infectiously. her voice is left relatively low in the mix, which gives the record a party vibe that's as vintage as late-'40s rhythm and blues and as contemporary as the djs and rappers who drop in on the album from time to time. there's a poignancy, too, in gray's persona. if this isn't a star on the rise, the world's gone tone-deaf.innerzone orchestraprogrammed (astralwerks)familiar to many for his role in building the detroit techno scene, carl craig reaches well beyond those musical boundaries for innerzone orchestra. the sounds and science of contemporary electronic music are linked to their cousins in the black-music legacy: soul, hip hop, funk, and, most important, jazz. \"blakula\" reads like a foreboding invitation to a dangerous yet enrapturing dance. it's a proposal worth accepting.death in vegasthe contino sessions (concrete/time bomb)when unlikely guest vocalist iggy pop shudders, \"i'm confused ... i'm vibrating!\" on the ghoulish \"aisha,\" he's not the only one left dazed and confused. this british outfit, well known in the dance world for their big-beat bombshells, also casts the potent voices of primal scream's bobby gillespie and the jesus & mary chain's jim reid as foils to producer richard fearless' aggressive wall of sound.tricky with dj muggs and greasejuxtapose (island def jam)it's not entirely obvious what tricky has accomplished by teaming up with cypress hill's dj muggs and dame grease, dmx's red-hot lead producer. tricky's wreaky, weed-soaked flow on the well-loved maxinquaye established him as a musical chameleon, but he's been unable to maintain such heights. juxtapose starts off well with \"for real.\" from there, a sense of desperation creeps in, most evident on \"bom bom diggy\" and \"she said.\" tricky prodigy mad dog spices up a few tracks with his cockney-patois dancehall toasting, but - perhaps fittingly - an initially intriguing project winds up producing more questions than highlights.horace silverjazz has a sense of humor (verve)pianist horace silver has been writing essentially the same style of music - hard bop - for four decades. silver started it, and the cats in new york still play variations of it. sure, the genre's become more sophisticated, but it's maintained its trademark combo of stompin' blues, catchy grooves, and all-out jams. swing tunes, sambas, quasi-tangos, and especially funk (the greasy, fried-catfish variety) - no groove is safe from this finger-popping visionary. and his band plays. with a hard-blowing front line of trumpeter ryan kisor and tenor saxophonist jimmy greene, silver stokes a fire that's long on chops but never short on charm.skunk anansiepost orgasmic chill (virgin)if trent reznor were a woman, he'd be skin, the velvet-voiced lead screamer of these british hard rockers. skin takes the attitude of grace jones and combines it with reznor's darkly beautiful lyrical style to create her own brand of brilliance. with a vocal range that should make mariah carey consider a career change, skin and her crew achieve musical ecstasy that'll heat up the most frigid postorgasmic chill.street crednetwork in a cablevirtual velvet undergrounddangerous beautyglobopopbuying timeholy rollerthe feel worldreadmemusiciridium showersbrain bytesfishing the art-house streamthink fastjust outta betaimage consciouslonelies get linkedcontributors"}
