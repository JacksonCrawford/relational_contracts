(and it is a bit baffling why nato thinks centuries of stupid ethnic hatred can be solved with a few smart bombs.)chalasani doesn't think kosovo will have much of an impact on the market -- unless russia takes some action. \"russia is the key,\" he said, noting that wall street would react very poorly indeed if moscow's opposition to the bombing of yugoslavia resulted in a return to the economic chaos that devastated us financial institutions last year.after two days of spectacular advances, tech stocks were running considerably slower as investors locked in some of their gains before exiting town for the weekend. dell computer (dell) rose 19 cents to us$38.31, and ibm (ibm) was $3.31 higher at $174.63. but microsoft (msft) slipped $1.56 to $178.38 amid uncertainty over settlement prospects in the company's antitrust trial.however, there's very little uncertainty where the internet's concerned; investors still can't get enough of the dot-com club. amazon.com (amzn) is a good case in point, advancing 13 cents to $140 on speculation that the online bookseller is planning to launch an auction service to boot. don't see why they wouldn't -- everyone else is doing it.separately, amazon has filed with the securities and exchange commission to boost its number of authorized common shares to 1.5 billion from 300 million. the company hopes to use all that extra cash to finance additional acquisitions -- like an established auctioneer, perhaps? -- and to make sure nobody thinks of making an unwanted play for amazon itself.in the meantime, online retailer cybershop international (cysp) jumped 26 percent to $13.75 as it unveiled its own auction service. ceo jeffrey tauber said the new feature will \"enable us to differentiate ourselves from other off-price retailers.\" sure, until they all launch auction services of their own.an outfit called speedus.com (spde), which provides broadband broadcasting services in the new york area, surged 128 percent to $3.34 after reporting a 1998 profit of 57 cents a diluted share, compared with a loss of 95 cents a year earlier. the company also said it has finished installing new linux-based internet technology, giving it the capability for digital video transmissions.from the ipo front, valley media (vmix) climbed 41 percent to $22.50 after debuting with 3.5 million shares initially priced at $16 each. and get this -- the company, which distributes music and video to retail shops, isn't even an internet player. go figure."}
