by realnetworks, ms, and others. who is this guy? and why is he so good at what he does? by leander kahney.", "author": "leander kahney", "category": "science", "type": "article", "timestamp":

virus. he uncovered microsoft's suspicious registration practices, and he discovered the presence of unique identifying numbers in the majority of digital documents. this week, he revealed realnetworks' sneaky data-gathering practices.smith has been at the center of half-a-dozen of the biggest technology stories this summer -- stories reported around the globe.and he does it for love, not money.\"the man's a living, national treasure for the internet age,\" said privacy advocate jason catlett, founder of junkbusters. \"he's doing wonderful things. richard's not a privacy zealot. he wants to find the consequences of things.\"he's independent of money and he's independent of politics,\" catlett said. \"he's very good at thinking through intrusive data gathering. if there were a dozen people like him, the internet would be a very different place.\"a 45-year-old veteran programmer, smith retired a couple of months ago from phar lap, the software company he helped build and still owns but no longer runs.he started looking at internet security issues as a hobby about three years ago, uncovering bugs and security holes in email clients and browsers.a year ago he turned his attention to privacy on the internet.\"we are moving our lives more and more onto the internet and it's very good at watching what we do,\" smith said from his home in brookline, massachusetts, where he lives with his wife. \"it's like a vcr recording your whole life. it can easily be rewound.\"smith said he's worried that the lack of internet privacy is a tremendous boon for the direct marketing industry and that personal data will come back to haunt consumers in legal proceedings.for example, smith noted that newt gingrich's divorce lawyers are trying to keep purportedly sensitive emails out of the hands of his wife's lawyers. in a separate instance, a court ruled this week that telephone companies could sell customers' telephone logs to direct marketers, who can mine the data to determine individual consumer preferences.\"we're going to get more and more junk mail,\" he said. \"the noise level is going to go up and up. maybe we'll get used to it, but i doubt it.\"smith tapped into the issue of realnetwork's underhanded data gathering practices while looking for material for a speech. he wanted something fresh to talk about and remembered an inconclusive report he'd read in an april edition of the seattle weekly about realnetworks using secret serial numbers.he downloaded realjukebox and loaded up a piece of software, called a packet sniffer, that decodes the stream of information his computer sent out over the internet.the first thing he noticed was that every time he used it to play a cd, the software sent the cd's title and playlist to realnetworks. he also noticed that it encrypted some information, so he enlisted a friend in australia to break the code and unlock the data. it turned out to be a guid, or unique identifying number, that can be used to identify who is using the software as effectively as a social security number.smith said the whole thing took about half an hour, and that most of the time was spent figuring out how to use the realjukebox software.he's started looking at other user-monitoring systems. for example, he said he's discovered that some junk email, when read, secretly sends out information about the user. through banner ads, many high-profile web sites are sending confidential user registration information to direct marketers without even knowing it.smith looks mainly at popular software \"so when it hits the press people say 'that affects me. i use that product.'\"he does it for fun and out of curiosity, he said, though he's starting to \"pre-consult\" for some of the companies he's investigating, opening up the possibility of turning his hobby into a commercial enterprise.smith's life hasn't changed much in light of all the publicity he's generated.\"i talk to a lot of people i hadn't known before,\" he said. \"i have a different crowd of people i go around with now.\"when he discovers a dodgy practice, smith said the first thing he does is inform the company before writing it up for his web site.sometimes he tells the press before the company. at least, that's what richard purcell, the man in charge of microsoft's data gathering policies, says.\"it would be nice to answer an inquiry before doing it in a public forum,\" purcell said. \"this is what we call fairness.\"although he may have caused microsoft some embarrassing public relations headaches, purcell said he bears no malice toward smith. in fact, purcell invited him up to redmond afterwards to meet a number of the company's product people and flesh out some outstanding privacy issues.\"he's a very talented technologist,\" purcell said. \"i like him.\""}
