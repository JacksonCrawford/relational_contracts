(stk) and emc corp. (emc) that warehouse the burgeoning amount of information available on the internet.one unidentified money manager with a large new york-based investment house repeated the oft-quoted belief that supplying technology to the fickle consumer market is a risky business, while supplying it to companies is a steady earner. the real money being made in technology is by companies that focus on using the internet to sell to other business customers, he said.\"there will be business-to-consumer companies that will work, but it's a crap shoot,\" he said of the difficulty in picking winners in the face of mercurial fashions and the tough competition from rival web sites.copyright"}
