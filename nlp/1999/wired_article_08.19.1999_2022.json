was first in flight, so it may as well be first in technology too, right? educators are trying hard to make the latter come true, but some experts believe the state's approach in preparing its children for the information age is not as progressive as it could be.wired news goes back to school- - - - - -the north carolina state board of education has mandated that, starting in 2001, every public-school student must pass a computer literacy exam to earn a high school diploma. no other state has this regulation.yet critics point out that the exam, administered by the state to students in eighth grade and above, requires little more than knowing how to pass a skills test. they'd rather students learn how to apply those skills in the real world.\"sometimes focusing on skills can detract from academics,\" said education technology specialist ed coughlin of the milken exchange, a nonprofit foundation created to assist states and schools in identifying effective technology uses.but north carolina educators, acknowledging that their state has become the south's technology leader, believe teaching rudimentary skills is the first step toward providing a complete information-age curriculum.\"we can't not bring [technology] into the schools because children will find school irrelevant without technology,\" said frances bradburne, the state's director of education technologies. \"it is becoming more important that our children become more technology-literate in our society. technology for kids is ubiquitous. it is everywhere.\"the north carolina tests of computer skills is part multiple-choice and part on-computer, and includes database, spreadsheet, and word-processing applications. students who fail are allowed to take it as many as three times per year through their senior year in high school. if they don't pass by then, they don't graduate.coughlin believes that teaching only computer skills has its pitfalls. he recently observed a video-conferencing demonstration within a highly regarded school district where two teachers attempted to show students how the technology worked. students were asked to suggest ways the technology could be used.\"that's not a very rich experience,\" said coughlin.chris moersch, the director of the national business education alliance, an organization that helps teachers integrate technology in the classroom, agrees that applying the technology to real-world content is the key.\"technology serves as a medium by which students can demonstrate what it is they know and what they are able to do,\" he explained. \"i think we put too much emphasis on technology skills instead of learning problem-solving, thinking skills, and solving complex tasks in group situations using the available technology.\"\"if they [technology skills] are not embedded in a contextual framework within the curriculum, they are useless,\" moersch added. still, something is better than nothing, said north carolina high school junior sheyenne michelizzi.\"it may be just another test to some people, but in the long run it will help students learn,\" said michelizzi, who passed the test on her first try at leesville high school in raleigh.her mother, lana, agreed.\"i think once they know these skills, they apply them,\" michelizzi said. \"it's naive to think that they wouldn't use them.\"north carolina's pioneering role in exploring technology standards goes as far back as 1985. their plan was in place even before the international society for technology in education (iste) set federal standards for schools, called the national education technology standards (nets).a 1998 milken exchange study showed that 40 states don't have any high school exit requirements in technology. eight states require some computer literacy or technology credit. maryland was in the process of implementing tech standards when the study was done.elsie brumbach, north carolina's former director of education technologies, said the state began formulating its computer education curriculum in 1985, and in 1995 it conducted pilot tests for the technology skills exam. the real test was first given to eighth-graders in 1997.on the first go-round, 70 percent of the eighth graders passed the test.brumbach said that creating the skills test was critical to making technology a priority in north carolina schools.\"i think we had to do that to get the funds, to get the attention, and to get people serious about teaching the skills -- to get everyone to agree that it was needed,\" she said. \"it's almost like you have to learn to crawl before you can walk.\"but, she added, \"in the future, technology skills need to be embedded right in the curriculum and taught right along with other content.\"coughlin said that applying technology to real problems is the \"type of assessment many states are struggling with.\"illinois' new trier high school, considered one of the best public secondary schools in the country, is an acknowledged leader in the field. students there use interactive physics programs that enable them to conduct an entire experiment on the computer. in english and foreign-language classes, students use powerpoint to enhance speeches and presentations.and with children becoming more technology savvy at home, coughlin asks, \"five years from now, will [the skills test] even be necessary?\""}
