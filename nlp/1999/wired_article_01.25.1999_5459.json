[the system] will continue to leave it off until you ask it to come on again.\"in his friday letter to barrett, markey expressed concern about the privacy issues surrounding the chip, which, when enabled, will send out a unique \"fingerprint\" identifier over the net.\"in my opinion, intel's new product improves technology for online commerce in a way that compromises personal privacy,\" markey wrote. \"i hope that intel will seek to design its products to improve the security of electronic commerce transactions without putting consumer privacy at risk.\"the chip, introduced on thursday, will have a built-in serial number to identify consumers in online transactions. intel planned originally to have the feature active at all times.privacy experts were cautiously optimistic over the chip company's u-turn.\"intel's decision is not a permanent solution,\" said dave banisar, policy director of the electronic privacy information center. \"these numbers can still be coerced out of people. i can see microsoft requiring these numbers to be turned on to use certain software. once it's turned on, you're screwed.\"as long as these numbers exist, it's a privacy disaster.\"dierdre mulligan, staff counsel for the center for democracy and technology, said intel's chip could dramatically change the way consumers experience privacy and security on the web.\"we're in an era where technical decisions and product rollouts can have serious social implications,\" mulligan said.mulligan said that the center for democracy and technology, along with epic and junkbusters, were discussing their concerns with intel.markey's decision to get involved came friday after reading news coverage of intel's announcement, said colin crowell, a member of markey's staff.\"he works a lot on electronic privacy issues and had heard rumblings from a number of folks in the privacy community [about the pentium iii],\" crowell said.\"[markey was] concerned that the pentium iii was going to skew privacy balance in a way that he felt was unnecessary to secure commercial security objectives, and asked that intel reconsider current plans.\"for its part, intel may have felt disinclined to cross any more swords with the government.last year, the federal trade commission filed an antitrust suit against intel, charging it with abusing its near-monopoly of pc microprocessors and bullying computer companies. since then, the government and intel have been gathering evidence to support their respective cases. the trial is tentatively scheduled to begin in early march.intel, meanwhile, plans to launch the pentium iii sometime this fiscal quarter.related wired links:boycott targets intel25.jan.99pirates sneer at intel chip22.jan.99hardwiring security21.jan.99"}
