- - - -some hope bentspace's radio-signal emails will reach extraterrestrials. others are concerned about space spam. still others worry about junking up the increasingly crowded cosmos with more radio signals.for now, bentspace is just hoping customers will materialize -- and be charmed enough by the concept to plunk down their cash.\"naturally, we can't promise that this mail will reach anyone or anything,\" said greg snow, president of bentspace. \"but it's very likely there's entities out there, and perhaps they're receiving and understanding our transmissions.\"if any entity does, snow said, they can also theoretically send a reply, which would then be received by bentspace.\"we can hope for that, of course, but we're not holding our breath,\" snow said.the five entrepreneurs who put together bentspace have invested about $70,000 to create a system that can beam messages into space.using standard tcp/ip protocol and wireless ethernet, bentspace converts email into radio signals that are beamed to a parabolic antenna, then out into space using the same band utilized by wireless computing devices and nasa. once on their way, messages theoretically travel forever through the universe to anyone -- or anything -- that cares to receive the signal.snow said that bentspace has garnered a fabulous variety of reactions to its plans.\"people get very emotional about this,\" snow said. \"for some of them it's like sending a cosmic message in a bottle or carving initials on a pyramid. some people say we're wasting people's money. some say we're spamming space and worry that extraterrestrials will take this as a sign of low intelligence. some people send us emails worrying that we're calling aliens who will come to earth to eat us!\"for those who worry about the dangers of attempting to contact life not of this earth, snow has reassuring words.\"radio waves in space are nothing new, so any extraterrestrials who conceivably have evil intentions have had over 50 years to show up,\" snow said. \"there are tons of i love lucy reruns up there bouncing around ... in space. i guess that could annoy extraterrestrials as much as our email.\"sensible critics worry about the noise-to-signal effects of purposely beaming still more radio waves into the universe. jeff mangum, deputy assistant director of the national radio astronomy observatory (nrao) in tucson, arizona, is concerned that an ever-increasing amount of radio transmissions from devices like cell phones will make radio astronomy more challenging.\"these waves just go on and on, and they're starting to become a problem,\" mangum said. \"there are problems with interference. terrestrial signals can be so strong that they totally swamp out the weaker signals we're trying to receive from space.\" mangum worries that the skyrocketing number of wireless computing devices will exacerbate the problem. he said projects like motorola's iridium initiative, which involved building satellites to receive and transmit worldwide cell phone signals, are creating a kind of radio-wave traffic jam in space.\"it's becoming [an] increasingly difficult battle,\" mangum said. \"there are fcc frequency-allocation committees that much of the time pit corporate interests against scientists. it often gets down to who has the most expensive lawyers. science just can't win.\"bentspace's signal is fairly weak -- its half-watt of broadcast power is roughly analogous to the power of a garage door opener. but even that weak signal can have repercussions, mangum said.\"we can detect signals from space that are exponentially weaker than half a watt,\" mangum said. \"by astronomical standards, even half a watt can theoretically be received anywhere in space. if we have even a garage door opener operating right next to a radio observatory it can make receiving signals a major problem. it's not so much that we're filling up space -- it's that we're interfering with reception.\"other astronomers pooh-pooh such concerns, saying bentspace's signal is so weak that it won't escape the solar system, much less cause problems.\"sounds a bit nutty to me,\" said mike gingell, president of the society of amateur radio astronomers. \"i can't see where they are going to get the megawatts of transmission ... even to reach the nearest planets, as done for radar experiments by serious scientists. half a watt -- by the time it gets to the nearest star -- will be zillions of watts weaker than the signals the nrao receives.\"nonetheless, bentspace is hoping enough customers will be curious or excited enough about the idea to make their enterprise profitable.\"some people think of this as immortality -- it's a little bit of them going through space forever,\" snow said."}
