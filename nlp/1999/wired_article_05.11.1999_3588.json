(legal fine print: lycos is in the process of acquiring wired news.)with net stocks once again on fire, thestreet.com (tscm) couldn't have picked a better day to go public. the online financial news service -- one of the most eagerly anticipated ipos in months -- saw its stock more than triple to $60 after arriving with 5.5 million shares starting at $19 each. the company had a loss of more than $16 million last year.but investors can be forgiven for ignoring thestreet's soggy bottom line. the company's backers include the likes of the new york times co. and rupert murdoch's news corp., and observers rightly note that financial news is one of the hotter commodities on the web, right up there with naughty pictures.rob martin, an analyst with friedman, billings, ramsey, said thestreet's prospects for profitability are greatly enhanced by the fact that it takes in revenue from subscriptions as well as advertising. \"it's the first hybrid model that's seen some success,\" he said.now get this: hitsgalore.com (hitt), a business-oriented search service that prides itself on the \"moral\" value of its content, got pounded as bloomberg news reported that its founder, dorian reed, hadn't disclosed that he was accused of cheating customers at a previous job as a telemarketer. hitsgalore's stock tumbled 53 percent to $9.38.so much for the moral high ground.in tech, all eyes were on cisco systems (csco), which rose $2.63 to $111.88. the company was slated to report its quarterly earnings after the closing bell, and income of 37 cents a share was expected. a more than 30 percent hike in revenue also was anticipated. if cisco outdoes either of these numbers, investors will feel a whole lot better about hardware makers as we near the second half of the year.dell computer (dell) advanced 38 cents to $42.63 as bt alex. brown upgraded the company's stock to \"buy\" from \"market perform.\" international business machines (ibm) gained $2.50 to $221.13, and intel (intc) was up $1.69 at $62.31.can you say \"bundle\"? qwest communications international (qwst) climbed $1.25 to $92.75 after joining with hewlett-packard and sap america to hawk net-based services to businesses. qwest will provide the network, hp the hardware and support, and sap the software. a pretty snazzy combo.immunex (imnx) led biotech firms back into the promised land, soaring 33 percent to $142.31 on word that its arthritis drug enbrel had come through tests with flying colors. american home products (ahp), which owns a majority stake in immunex, was up $2.88 at $62.63.lastly, sony (sne) closed unchanged at $93 following news that the company will begin selling a robot dog named aibo. the pint-size pooch has sensors in its paws and a camera to keep it from bumping into the furniture. aibo can sit and beg and, when pleased, will wag its tail.all for just $2,500. or for about $2,480 less, dog lovers can head down to the local spca and give a home to a proper puppy, which won't short out in the rain and won't require the user to hit ctrl-alt-delete every 45 minutes."}
