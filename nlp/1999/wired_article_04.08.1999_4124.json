it's too early to start writing any obits, but oakes figures competition among rival players will intensify as advertisers begin expanding their horizons.meanwhile, from the ipo front, value america (vusa) startled absolutely no one with a splashy trading debut. the online retailer soared 140 percent to $55.19 after arriving with 5.5 million shares initially priced at a hefty $23 a throw. value america lost nearly $54 million last year. sooner or later, you all realize, this sort of thing is going to have to stop.online brokers enjoyed a happy spike as jb oxford holdings (jboh) told analysts that it expects profit in the current quarter to meet or exceed the almost $3 million earned in the previous three months. the firm's shares soared 62 percent to $14.81, while ameritrade (amtd) was up 11 percent at $105.50, and etrade group (egrp) rose $8.38 to $92.88.there were some mixed messages from the software crowd. hnc software (hncs) tumbled 43 percent to $15.50 after warning that its first-quarter income will come in well below the estimated 22 cents a share. but check point software technologies (chkp) climbed 26 percent to $33.69 as it looked forward to \"strong results,\" in line with profit expectations of 44 cents.internet-application maker spyglass (spyg) gained 29 percent to $17.63 on word that it will pay more than $11 million for navitel communications, a developer of programs for windows ce-based gadgets. the deal marks a further tightening of spyglass' relationship with microsoft (msft). on wednesday, the two companies announced a licensing and cooperation accord for windows ce products.microsoft's own share price advanced $1.25 to $94.56 as the company hinted that it may finally share the programming code for its windows operating system with software developers -- a move that would go a heck of a long way in making nice with antitrust regulators. separately, redmond said that it would release an upgraded version of windows 98 next year, putting the kibosh, at least for the moment, on introduction of a one-size-fits-all windows 2000 system.there were smiles in the retail sector. wal-mart stores (wmt), the world's biggest retailer, rose $4.50 to $102 after saying that march sales in stores open at least a year increased 11 percent from a year before. and gap (gps) was $4.19 higher at $72.56 on news that its march sales were up 21 percent. must be those way-cool commercials the company's been running.celestial seasonings (ctea), maker of those tasty herbal teas that keep hyperactive financial columnists from becoming nervous wrecks, sank 16 percent to $17.38 as it warned quarterly earnings will come in at around 28 cents a share, nowhere near the anticipated 41 cents. celestial's stock was promptly downgraded by a pair of securities houses.lastly, some heightened interest in bill gates' bank account from our friends across the atlantic. the bbc noted that recent gains in microsoft's value mean that gates is now worth $100 billion and is on track to become the world's first trillionaire. at the same time, london's daily telegraph figured that big bill earned about $4.5 million an hour last year, and at this rate should hit $1 trillion by 2004.herbal tea, lads?"}
