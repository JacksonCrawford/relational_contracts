(the company's shares closed monday at almost $355.) although amazon said its fourth-quarter sales jumped to $250 million -- four times higher than a year ago -- increased operating costs and aggressive pricing mean all that extra cash won't reduce the bookseller's ongoing losses.\"profitability is important, but it's more important for mature industries,\" said paul merenbloom, an analyst with prudential securities. \"with companies like amazon, the profitability comes on a longer-term basis.\"investors seem comfortable with this perspective. wall street expects amazon to report a loss of 54 cents a share when it posts its quarterly earnings, or lack thereof, later this month. but traders will maintain their focus on those rising revenues, and not on the company's empty pockets. don't be surprised if amazon's stock starts creeping back above $200 within weeks, if not days.in telecom, britain's top wireless phone service, vodafone group (vod), made a big splash in the pool with a sudden bid to acquire its american counterpart, airtouch communications (ati), for more than $45 billion. the offer comes as airtouch hold talks with another suitor, bell atlantic (bel), on a $43 billion buyout.the prospect of a cross-atlantic bidding war propelled airtouch's stock up $5.13 to $73.38. investors seemed unsure which romeo would win juliet's hand, so they placed their money in both camps. bell atlantic rose $1.81 to $53.75, and vodafone was up $5 at $179.63.meanwhile, mci worldcom (wcom) gained $4.06 to $73.94 as the second-largest us long-distance carrier was reiterated a \"buy\" by salomon smith barney. analyst jack grubman believes the company's stock will rise to $100 within the next year.and equalnet communications (enet) weighed in with news that subscribers can now sign up for its discounted long-distance service via the net. why such a development should send a stock orbital, no one knows. but equalnet soared $1.16, or 119 percent, to $2.13.on the tech front, microsoft (msft) advanced $5.31 to $146.31 as lehman brothers reiterated a \"buy\" rating for the company's shares. the brokerage raised its 12-month price target to $185 from $140.lastly, daimlerchrysler (dcx) saw its stock downgraded to \"hold\" from \"strong buy\" by warburg dillon read, but still managed to rise $1.50 to $103.19 on rumors that the auto giant may extend its reach to asia by purchasing japan's troubled nissan motor.daimlerchryslernissan? now there's a mouthful."}
