things, like the terminator 2 t-1000 and the nokia 8810, are always neato - it's just that simple. but the titanium-clad cdma/tdma digital handset has other strengths as well. behind a sliding cover, the touchpad accesses an address directory and calendar, which can wirelessly sync with your pc via an infrared port. the phone also has three videogames, but you may not want to play them where someone might see you. 8800 series: $600. nokia: www.nokia.com.__ air compressor __the mpeg-1 encoder/decoder chip inside the m2 multimedia recorder does a workstation's job, compressing stills, audio, and video into ultrasmall jpeg and mpeg formats. uncompressed input comes in live via the ccd and microphone. then your computer can grab the encoded files through the serial or scsi ports or with a pc-card reader. if human evolution had produced a swappable experience-recorder like this earlier, we wouldn't need language, which compresses even more than mpeg but introduces far more ambiguity. m2 multimedia recorder: $1,499. hitachi: (800) 816 2364, www.hitachi.com.__ status stopper __we like marc newson. designers tra-ditionally express their manifestos with chairs and tea services, but newson proposes a new standard: the doorstop. newson's rock doesn't stop doors any better or worse than a brick or a 386, nor can it pour tea. it simply exists and may be moved by hand. the rest is pure design. made out of polypropylene by the magis company in italy, the rock may be filled with sand, shot, or tea leaves. the rock: $66. distributed by the fig garden: +1 (415) 457 9443.__ eye in the sky __the microsentinel security system from security data networks includes up to four wireless 2.4-ghz color cameras and a receiver that plugs into your pc. when the system detects motion, it records time-stamped stills, audio, or video and saves the files locally, emails them to you, or archives them (password protected) on sdn's web site. meanwhile, it notifies you by phone. you can also monitor a live video feed from the pc to keep a vigilant eye on family, pets, domestic help, or government agents who may be outside. microsentinel (with one camera): $699. security data networks: (800) 747 9101, +1 (919) 851 1778, www.sdn.net.__ talking nonsense __tots will positively fall over when they see that the new actimates are teletubbies. a licensing agreement has turned the high-saturation technosimians into the latest of microsoft's interactive e-dolls, which sense and respond to sound and touch. add the actimates tv pack, and the tubby toys will react directly to the telly, as they properly should. po (red, circle) and laa-laa (yellow, curlicue) actimates arrived in march. tinky-winky (purple, triangle) and dipsy (green, spike) will join the fun in august. actimates interactive teletubbies: $54.95. microsoft: www.microsoft.com/actimates.__ dock worker __you've secretly recorded a lurid barroom confession implicating a major political figure, and you need to send the evidence to a literary agent in new york pronto. it's easy with the walkabout quest handheld recorder: specify a recipient in the address book on the touchscreen, and when you replace the recorder in its docking station, the audio clips are automatically emailed. the dock attaches to your pc, but the clips are sent without ever having to download them onto your hard drive. walkabout quest: $449. dictaphone: (888) 483 6266, www.dictaphone.com.__ clocker __glove radar fits on any baseball mitt and displays the speed of the ball you just caught in mph. a standard 3-volt lithium camera battery powers the small, 5.7-ghz doppler radar, which sits behind the pocket and sees through the webbing. by applying speed-trap-style radar to the national pastime, glove radar will ensure that your kid's fastball won't fade. or at least it won't fade from memory when he tears his rotator cuff trying to prove he can clock 70. glove radar: $79.95. sports sensors: (800) 589 3709.__ really remote __receivers, tvs, cd players, and satellite systems typically use infrared remotes, which require line of sight. but a single jensen sc-595 universal remote can operate all these components through walls and floors as far as 95 feet away. a small transponder placed in front of your equipment translates the jensen's commands from 900-mhz uhf into infrared, and a library of codes ensures the system's compatibility with products from dozens of manufacturers. expect future versions of the sleek couchtop to expand compatibility further by ordering pizzas and opening beer bottles. sc-595: $99.95. jensen: (800) 962 3986.__ radio futurama __audio engineers have long sought a digital receiver, which would allow complete control over the radio signal without expensive circuitry. previous attempts have been plagued by annoying delays when tuning in a new frequency. blaupunkt's new digiceiver line, including the colorful nevada here, digitizes signals in the first stages and converts them back to analog just before output. blaupunkt explains that this feature allows precise equalization, suppressing an interior's bass resonances and filling in its frequency dips. but it opens up future improvements as well. too bad the thing has to go into a car. nevada digiceiver: $349.95. blaupunkt: (800) 950 2528.*thanks to ivan berger. *"}
