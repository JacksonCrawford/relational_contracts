easy. bring 7-eleven into the equation. david lazarus reports from tokyo.", "author": "david lazarus", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "06.07.1999 11:30 AM", "text": "tokyo -- it works like this: a shopper will browse thousands of japanese book and cd titles on the web. the order will be placed electronically. then, a few days later, the shopper will traipse down to his or her local 7-eleven, fork over some yen to the clerk, and receive the goodies.see also: dreamcast's worst nightmare- - - - - -this is how electronic retailing is envisioned in japan by amazon-wannabe softbank and its new partners: 7-eleven, yahoo japan, and tohan, the nation's leading book distributor. their new venture, dubbed es-books, is slated to open for business in november.es-books is intended to do an end run around a couple of obstacles that have hampered cyber-shopping in this country: a widespread preference for using cash payments and money transfers instead of credit cards, and a persistent apprehension about transacting business online.so japan's softbank, owner of the ziff-davis publishing group and yahoo's single biggest shareholder, has come up with an idea to exploit growing interest in the internet without rocking the cultural boat.but is the new venture actually e-commerce?\"it's definitely e-commerce,\" answered daniel scuka, managing editor of computing japan magazine. \"but it's e-commerce the japanese way.\"consumers here \"are more comfortable dealing face to face, even if it's only with a pimply-faced clerk at a convenience store.\"of course, scuka admitted that what softbank and its partners are doing may not help usher in the sort of direct communication that is changing the face of retailing in the west. \"if the goal of e-commerce is to disintermediate the process,\" he noted, \"the japanese have found a way to add an intermediary.\"masayoshi son, the billionaire head of softbank frequently referred to in the local press as \"japan's bill gates,\" has no doubt that he's figured out a way to bring an amazon-like shopping experience to customers, while still maintaining the status quo among skittish japanese retailers and distributors.\"we have grouped the best firms in each sector and, with each of us doing what we do best, we aim to succeed,\" he told reporters the other day. \"we're the all-japan champions.\"es-books will have an initial capitalization of approximately us$1.6 million. softbank will hold a 50 percent stake in the venture, while 7-eleven will have 30 percent, and yahoo japan and tohan will each hold 10 percent. an outfit called yamato transport will be used to hand-deliver books and cds to the convenience store nearest a shopper's home.the partners have yet to say how the delivery and handling charges along the way will affect prices.the idea of centering e-commerce, or something that looks like e-commerce, on japan's ubiquitous convenience stores isn't new. various chains now offer a variety of services through in-store information terminals. the most expansive to date is the so-called loppi system developed by ibm japan for the lawson chain.using loppi, shoppers employ a touch screen to browse online catalogs, download software, or book package tours to overseas destinations. in most cases, once an order is made, the shopper receives a paper receipt that is then presented to the convenience-store clerk for payment.lawson has invested nearly $60 million installing loppi terminals in its 6,700 outlets nationwide, and is forecasting approximately $900 million in \"online\" sales over the next few years. the retailers, the convenience store, and affiliated delivery companies all share in the proceeds.accessing the internet via convenience stores is perhaps one reason that net usage is growing fastest in japan among housewives, according to a recent survey by infocom research. about 25 percent of new users now fall into this category, the survey found, compared with housewives comprising 20 percent of new users in 1998 and 10 percent a year earlier.so is e-commerce in japan doomed to a twisted half-life of online browsing and offline transactions? maybe not.citing anonymous sources, the yomiuri newspaper reported last week that about 100 japanese financial institutions -- including most leading banks and the country's post offices, where many people maintain low-interest savings accounts -- are banding together to foster online transactions.a cyber-mall consisting of about 500 leading companies will be established by next march, the paper said, and electronic payments will be made using the secure electronic transaction standard now common in the united states.scuka figures that, after years of dithering, japan's public and private industries have finally decided to embrace the net.\"it's the only thing that will save them,\" he said. \"the economy is in such bad shape they at last realize that the internet is probably the only way they can get things going again.\"that, or they can just move all corporate and government offices to the local convenience store.stock columnist david lazarus is on special assignment in japan. this is part of an occasional series about how technology is changing japanese life."}
