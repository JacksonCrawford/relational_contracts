maybe you just aren't loud enough. suitable for both street-corner rants and boardroom earnings presentations, fender's passport p-150 packs a public-address system into a 28-pound suitcase. the two 75-watt speakers draw from a novice-friendly mixer that can take three mikes and one line input. you can even add reverb - a nice fender touch. the system sets up in minutes, and includes a microphone. you can stand on it (so people look up to you), and with the optional battery pack you can run cordless for eight hours - a full day shift of spreading the word. passport p-150: $699. fender musical instruments: +1 (602) 596 9690, www.fender.com.__ mighty mouse __unlike older optical mouses, microsoft's streamlined intellimouse explorer needs no pad; it correlates 1,500 images per second to track movements on almost any surface and delivers the information at 12 times the typical rate. due out in september, the ball-less wonder works through either a ps/2 or usb port, and its scrolling/zooming wheel and customizable buttons make frequent operations reflex-fast. now if microsoft would only stop adding explorer to every product name, they'd have it made. intellimouse explorer: $74.95. microsoft: +1 (425) 882 8080, www.microsoft.com."}
