(not a particularly forward-looking approach, considering that most us workers job-hop seven or eight times over their careers.) teamvest, on the other hand, offers its forecasts and advice free (you do pay charges for a one-on-one consultation with an analyst) and makes itself available to everybody: employers, 401(k) providers, and individual investors.like the others, teamvest is web based and fairly easy to use. just call up the site, answer some questions about your age, goals, employer's 401(k) plan, and risk tolerance, and then wait less than a minute for it to recommend the best match out of 21 portfolios - generally consisting of mutual funds - culled from your firm's 401(k) package. if the plan isn't in the teamvest database, the service will solicit a copy and add the plan to its files. in exchange for helping expand its roster, teamvest will give you a year of its deluxe assistance free (a value of $340 to $625). intuit has partnered with teamvest, which means you can also access the service through quicken.com. the two plan to expand this site so you can track all your investments there.financial engines, admittedly, has a sexier methodology than teamvest - the \"engine,\" a sophisticated computer model developed by nobel laureate william sharpe. but its recommendations aren't tempered as much by the common sense of financial professionals as they are at 401k forum and teamvest. you might regard financial engines, with its formula-driven technique, as the inktomi of retirement planning, while 401k forum and teamvest are, with their human editors, more akin to yahoo!401k forum: new moneyyour retirement windowinside telecosmwho's zooming whonew metricsaggressive rewards"}
