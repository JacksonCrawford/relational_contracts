in other words, it depends upon the county where the driver was cited, regardless of dmv approval.traffic school online said that 80 out of the 136 courts in california have approved their online course; web traffic school is in 111 courts. both companies said they plan to expand to other states.nossoff complained that once someone signs up on the web, a friend or relative could do the test for the offender, whereas a classroom traffic school can verify the driver is present.web traffic school ceo isaak tsifrin said his company has taken steps to ensure that the driver is the one taking the test. when students begin the course, they supply such information as height, eye color, weight, part of their credit card number, four digits of their social security number, etc.also, at different points during the online course, a window will pop up asking for verification from the driver. the window is programmed to stay open for a specified period of time; if no answer or an incorrect answer is supplied ... busted again.\"we presume that you will not share this personal information with other people,\" tsifrin said.additionally, in february, tsifrin's site will use voice recognition software for courts that require it, he added.both schools will not advance the user to the next section unless they have spent an acceptable amount of time reviewing the material.in some courts, drivers can take an online course, but they must go to a separate location to take the final exam in person.cheating could also be a concern; students conceivably could have two browser windows open simultaneously -- one for the test and the other to view the section being tested. or, they could have two computers operating at the same time.but many classroom schools don't require any tests anyway.\"a free pizza 4 you comedy 2\" traffic school requires that students take a 10-question, true-false test.\"it's very, very hard to fail,\" said suzanne coleman, customer service manager for the school.that doesn't mean the school lacks legitimacy, she said. \"we are a serious school but we have pizza and comedy passes to ease the pain of traffic school,\" she said. \"sometimes a student doesn't want a cop teaching the class. instead, they want a regular instructor who can relate to the different situations with a twist of comedy.\"joe munsinger said his teacher reminded him of tony randall. he enjoyed the class and said he would go again if he had to.\"[internet traffic school] doesn't sound like it's as much fun,\" munsinger said.\"traffic school is a really good way to learn about traffic laws and your rights,\" munsinger said. \"i guess i still drive like a maniac, though.\"indeed, a 1995 california dmv study found little attitude change or knowledge gain for drivers who attended traffic school. in fact, those who attended the schools had a higher 1-year accident rate than those who got a conviction, a 1991 study showed.\"that's cause for concern,\" the dmv's nossoff said.and the live schools are all equally unsuccessful at producing better drivers.\"we didn't find any difference between the pizza and the non-pizza and the comedy and the non-comedy,\" nossoff said.tsifrin said that's why the online schools are better.\"people are physically there but their mind is wandering. an instructor cannot verify what each student knows and if he is listening,\" tsifrin said.so far, the net has not cut into their business, a free pizza 4 you comedy 2's coleman said.\"we're just as busy as we are any other day,\" she said."}
