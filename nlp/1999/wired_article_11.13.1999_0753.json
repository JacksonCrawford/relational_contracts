but congress makes sure the net firms will have to pay big bucks for it. declan mccullagh reports from washington.", "author": "declan mccullagh", "category": "security", "type": "article", "timestamp": "11.13.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "washington -- the debate over intellectual property rights in a satellite tv bill sounds not just painfully obscure, but as dull as the prospect of listening to al gore give another speech on global warming. but the stakes in this particular legislative tussle are so high that internet companies spent the week waging a war of nastygrams with the entertainment industry, broadcasters, and sports leagues. the score so far: establishment 1, internet 0.at issue is whether or not america online, yahoo, and other net firms can readily carry local tv programming for a fixed fee, a benefit that the legislation will hand to satellite firms, and which cable companies already enjoy.but the bill won't extend the same \"compulsory license\" arrangement to internet companies, which are complaining that they can't carry the programming their customers want without it.so everyone busied themselves doing the only thing lobbyists know how to do: twisting arms on capitol hill.house commerce committee chairman tom bliley (r-va) sided with aol. \"the importance of the internet and other online communications technologies for enhancing consumer access to information and programming cannot be overstated,\" bliley wrote in a letter.legendary motion picture lobbyist jack valenti didn't seem to need an intermediary. he and other groups including the recording industry association of america, the national association of broadcasters, the nfl, and major league baseball joined him in opposing bliley.the outcome of this godzilla vs. bambi debate wasn't surprising. tech firms may be worth billions in the marketplace, but they sure haven't spent it on lobbyists and campaign contributions. before the campaign was even really underway, the house of representatives already had voted for the bill tuesday without the \"compulsory licensing\" stuff in it.critics of compulsory licenses say that's a good move. \"it bodes well that congress has decided to protect private property and if the internet community comes to washington to seek giveaways, they're doing the wrong thing and they deserve to lose,\" says kent lassman, a policy analyst at the free-market citizens for a sound economy.but the senate has yet to weigh in, and a vote is likely when it reconvenes at 10 a.m. next tuesday.__microsoft's keywords: __jamie love, self-appointed microsoft critic and gadfly-at-large, clearly had too much time on his hands this week. the ralph nader-employed economist did some automated word-counting of judge thomas penfield jackson's 207-page view of microsoft's history of strong-arming competitors.here's how many times keywords appear, according to love:comments were due by 10 november to the us federal reserve board, and two mixed-race groups had a lot to say.\"this proposal will only intensify that feeling of dread that occurs when [people] are confronted with invasive racial classification questions while filling out school, medical and other types of forms. we would personally be loath to honestly answer any question regarding ... race on any form related to financial services,\" the editors of multiracial activist and interracial voice wrote in a letter to the fed.the multiracial activist identifies itself as a publication focusing on topics of interest to multiracial people and families, and transracial adoptees.spying concealed: an aide to rep. bob barr (r-georgia) tells us that some house committee chairmen may not like the idea of hearings devoted to highlighting the national security agency's spying practices. they may happen behind closed doors, with the public prevented from attending.critics say the nsa has been increasing its electronic surveillance of pretty much everyone who uses a phone or computer to communicate, and recent press reports about the so-called echelon system have fueled debate.a representative of one privacy group tells us he met with barr, a former cia analyst turned hard-core conservative, a few days ago. his advice to the congressman: ignore the echelon controversy, and focus instead on illegal surveillance of americans.__privacy rules: __some legislators finally seem willing to do something reasonable to protect privacy.rep steve chabot (r-ohio) this week introduced a bill that requires federal agencies to consider how new regulations will affect americans' privacy. cosponsors include 20 members of congress including republicans ron paul and chris cox.but don't get too excited. the bill -- it's not on thomas yet, but the number is hr3307 -- doesn't adequately define what a \"privacy impact\" is. and agencies tend to use boilerplate language in these statements anyway.__firm disclosure: __the ftc and department of commerce on monday co-hosted an event to talk about online consumer profiling.the idea is that more government regulations might be necessary, though advertising firms such as doubleclick, matchlogic, and adforce say they're taking additional steps to disclose their data collection practices. (pro-regulatory groups weren't swayed, and one representative reportedly insisted at the meeting that \"we can't let consumers have what they want.\")in town for the gathering was veteran privacy guru alan westin, who has been writing on the topic for over 30 years. we caught up to him at his 70th birthday party.presented with the usual cake and candles, westin managed to extinguish them all with one breath. he then quipped: \"that's a great blow for privacy.\""}
