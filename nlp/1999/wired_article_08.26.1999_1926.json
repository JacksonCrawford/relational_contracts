- - - -\"we'll see an explosion of virtual universities in third world countries. it will be a way to leapfrog ahead,\" predicted shola aboderin, chief academic officer of the african virtual university.the african virtual university, which the world bank created and now manages, targets sub-saharan africa, which includes some of the poorest nations in the world.\"the rate of higher education is between 4 to 6 percent. and the fastest-growing segment of the population is the age group between 15 and 20. so you have a mass of people who are not going any where,\" said avu's chief academic officer, shola aboderin.and because virtual universities are definitely cheaper than setting up traditional institutions, international development agencies like the world bank are eager to jump on the global classroom bandwagon.\"for us in africa, the virtual university is a necessity now,\" said aboderin. \"we have large numbers of people who need to be educated, and it's the great equalizer.\"and the existing educational system cannot accommodate the vast numbers of students looking for a college education. in nigeria, for example, only 25 percent of qualified students can get into college, because sub-saharan africa does not have enough universities, aboderin said.the avu, which plans to launch bachelor programs in computer science and electrical engineering next year, hopes to ultimately accomodate 500,000 students.as of now, the curriculum in most online programs is heavily weighted toward technology courses. the aim is to create a highly skilled workforce that will be able to participate in the global information economy.university tun abdul razak (unitar), the malaysian cyber-university, is part of an ambitious national agenda for transforming malaysia into a tech superpower. according to mohamad salmi, deputy president of technology at unitar, the virtual university is a \"more prudent way to spend on education, because it is one of the best ways to produce knowledge workers for the multimedia super corridor.\" the $40 billion msc project is located in a 9-by-30-mile zone dedicated to testing and developing cutting-edge hardware and software.like malaysia, online education in india is geared mostly toward improving technology skills.beginning 1 september, indian students will be able to earn a bachelor's in information technology online. the bit program is part of the virtual campus initiative launched by the indira gandhi national open university, the country's premier distance learning institution. the ignou \"campus\" comprises a series of wired classrooms, called tele-centers, spread across the country.the pilot program, which uses satellite, video, and internet-based resources, is being launched with 2,400 students, through tele-centers in 12 cities, said michael haigh, regional manager for uk-based edexcel foundation, which is partnering ignou's virtual campus initiative.the program targets both recent high school graduates and adults who may want to switch career tracks. \"maybe you have a degree in one of the other disciplines, and want to improve your job prospects with a bit,\" said haigh.the ignou initiative is just the latest in a nationwide scramble toward online tech-oriented learning. private companies like national institute of information technology and zee education have been offering online professional development courses for over a year.indians can now also earn american university degrees from home. the quantum institute was the first indian university offering american degrees online to students in india, offering a post-graduate master's of computer science course from the university of illinois at urbana-champaign. the cost for the 12-month program, which combines classroom and online teaching, is approximately us$8,000.online tech education is not only convenient, but also cheap, both for the student and the university. and that makes it ideal for resource-strapped nations like india and malaysia.teaching online makes education \"more accessible and more cost-effective,\" said haigh at edexcel. and for countries like malaysia that are already spending vast amounts on it equipment, the online approach makes perfect sense, said salmi.virtual universities offer a quick and cost-effective way to offer access to higher education on a mass scale. \"a very good internet infrastructure costs a lot of money up front, but when you amortize it per student over the years, it makes sense,\" aboderin said.she admits that virtual education is not \"the magic bullet,\" but argues that its potential is too important to ignore. \"we didn't participate in the agricultural revolution or the industrial revolution. we can't afford to allow the information revolution pass us by. at least now, all that you need is your brain,\" said aboderin."}
