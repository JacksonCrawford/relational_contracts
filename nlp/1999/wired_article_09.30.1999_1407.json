'flip-flop' is kind of a pejorative term, but in this case they've gotten to the right policy.\"magaziner said that in his years as a senior white house adviser he argued against cracking down on encryption exports. since leaving the administration, he has spoken out against us policy on the issue.previous us policy struck everyone from hackers to european politicians to silicon valley executives as a bad idea. even attorney general janet reno finally came around to the view that law enforcement would not be hurt by opening up the flow of strong crypto. criminal elements would have all the access to code they wanted anyway.\"it's fair to say that the internet is a relatively new phenomenon,\" magaziner said. \"in my [white house] position it was a major part of what i was doing for a number of years. whereas, for a number of others for whom this was a smaller part of what they were doing, it may have taken longer to get to a full understanding of the internet.\"it was not only an unwise policy, but it was a futile policy. it was impossible for the policy to succeed.... i fought for this going back to the beginning. when i first became involved at the beginning of 1995 in this whole arena, there were a number of issues where i thought the administration was ... on the wrong track, and this was one of them.\"magaziner urged patience on the ongoing wrangling over domain names. just this week, network solutions inc. agreed to a compromise with the us commerce department on letting competing firms register internet domain names. the agreement gives network solutions at least four more years of maintaining its massive database of more than five million such names ending in .com, .net, and org.\"some people have looked at it and said 'well, four years is a long time,'\" he said. \"the internet is going to be around for a long time.\"but the nonprofit internet corporation for assigned names and numbers (icann), under the authorization of the administration, has given more than 70 companies the right to compete with network solutions.\"i think it's a move in the right direction,\" magaziner said of this week's agreement. \"prices are already coming down significantly to register domain names, from us$35 to $6.\"magaziner's early years in the white house were spent working 20-hour days trying to hammer out a policy on health care that would expand the government's role. when he did his research on the internet, he came to the conclusion that less was more -- less government regulation, more growth in the internet. this basic philosophy applied to domain names as well.\"we moved to try to privatize the naming of domain names on the internet,\" he said. \"the us government had created a monopoly and we had to create a level playing field. in evolving a new institution like icann, and in freeing up for competition a system that had been essentially a monopoly, the line we had to walk was you didn't want the system to break down. the system worked. it functioned. you didn't want to jeopardize that by moving too quickly.\"magaziner earned a rest from government service, taking so much of the abuse of right-wing critics of the clinton administration, and he does not talk like a man eager to get back into that realm. he is \"ensconced\" in private life now, happily relocated to new england, and even the prospect of working with hillary rodham clinton in her new york senate race does not tempt him, he said.\"it's going to be brutal,\" he said of clinton's battle with new york mayor rudy giuliani."}
