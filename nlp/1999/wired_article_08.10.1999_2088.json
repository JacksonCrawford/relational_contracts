[but that] market is dominated by sun microsystems and hewlett and compaq -- tough companies to compete against. they [sgi] still have a strong niche in the graphics market but the days of their growth and selling those machines at exorbitant prices are gone.\"the company said its advanced design technology could be used to help companies deliver richer content like streaming video over the net.\"we think big corporate networks and content providers are going to need very complex and media-intensive images,\" said sgi senior vice president bill kelly.sgi plans to spin off its mediabase media streaming application, engineering team and technology to a newly formed company with venture capital backing in which it would hold a \"significant\" minority stake.in addition, sgi said it would form an alliance with japan's nec to market sgi's high-end systems in japan.sgi shares were down 2-3/16 at 14 after the restructuring plan was announced.reuters contributed to this report"}
