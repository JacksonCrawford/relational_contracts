[it's important] to gain access to the silicon valley culture and entrepreneurial environment.\"a home base in the valley also brings students closer to the companies they'd like to work for.\"students can't conduct a silicon valley job search out of new hampshire,\" said anderson, who predicted that all of the top business schools will have facilities in the valley within 18 months. \"i think it's going to become a wave.\"students and companies have prompted the university of michigan business school to consider establishing a permanent presence in silicon valley, said keith decie, the assistant to the dean of the school, which as yet has no definite plans. ironically, one of the schools nearest to silicon valley still doesn't feel close enough to the action. uc berkeley plans to open an office in the next six to nine months to make access to silicon valley even more convenient for students and faculty. the outpost will be similar to harvard's satellite, said richard kurovsky, executive director of marketing at the haas school of business.\"having a place with our name on it will increase our presence in the valley,\" he said.mitchel harad, a recent graduate from the haas school, is finding his silicon valley connections invaluable as he starts his own internet company.\"i decided i wanted to come to silicon valley, and i knew zero people. graduate school let me meet some smart people and build a really strong network out here.\"to have a meeting place in the valley would be handy, harad said, because \"sometimes it takes some persuading to get someone up [to berkeley] from mountain view.\"not all schools are sold on the silicon valley boom.professor donna hoffman, director of the project 2000 e-commerce mba program at vanderbilt university, said establishing an outpost in silicon valley \"makes no sense for us.\"vanderbilt students already maintain contact with california companies via email and participate in student internships there.\"e-commerce opportunities are everywhere now,\" said hoffman, and students are going to many cities to pursue them.eric clemons, professor of information strategy systems and economics at the university of pennsylvania's wharton school, acknowledged that \"there is some real advantage in geographic proximity.\" but, like hoffman, he doesn't see silicon valley as the best destination for wharton grads.\"i don't want to sound arrogant, but the vast majority of our students could go anywhere,\" clemons said.still, wharton will do all it can to ensure its graduates are well placed, clemons said. \"i know that the school is prepared to put roots where it needs to.\"at least one school plans to move east rather than west. the new institute for ecommerce at carnegie mellon plans a satellite operation in new york, possibly by fall.the new york branch will offer a combination of classes taught by carnegie mellon faculty and classes accessed through the web, said director tridas mukhopadhyay.for those who choose to go west, stanford clearly has the edge. \"certainly it's a drawing card to be located in silicon valley,\" said janet zich, associate news director of the business school. forty of its 365 students are already drawing up plans to start their own companies immediately after graduation, and zich expects the trend to continue.\"why do you think so many schools are opening outposts here?\" she asked. \"it's obviously the hot thing.\"tuck's anderson believes that there is plenty of room for more mbas from other schools.\"stanford mbas will continue to dominate, [but] you don't want a company where everyone has the same educational background,\" he said. \"that's a recipe for disaster.\""}
