(hlth) filed for an ipo during the height of the summer run-up in net stocks. the health-care software company had big ideas, but hadn't yet developed the products to back them up. it was nonetheless billed as a pending superstar offering.by the time the scheduled offering date rolled around, however, the markets had dipped, and investor enthusiasm for concept stocks had withered. healtheon pulled the offering until february, when it could demonstrate some successes.will the current market hold up long enough for the toddling drkoop.com?koop is a trained pediatrician, but it's anyone's guess whether he can safely nurture his young company through to adulthood."}
