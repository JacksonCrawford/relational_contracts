that brings it into conflict with strict jewish law, which forbids merchants from doing business on the sabbath. or does it? by tony kontzer.", "author": "tony kontzer", "category": "culture", "type":

observant jews can benefit from one of the greatest loopholes ever to come along: the internet. according to jewish scholars and religious leaders, the web is enabling jewish business owners to continue generating profits at times when, historically, they haven't been able to do so.naturally, this has been a welcome development among observant merchants.see also: crossing the red c++- - - - - -\"until now, we couldn't conduct commerce on the sabbath,\" says ari wasserman, an orthodox jew who happens to be vice president of business development for carsdirect.com. \"the web has actually enabled us.\"for instance, online customers of carsdirect need not concern themselves with whether they are attempting to purchase a vehicle at permissible times. conversely, in the physical world, customers understand that observant jewish retailers will not be open for business during the sabbath, which runs from sundown friday until darkness falls saturday.such a restriction can be traced to a list of 39 categories of prohibited activities that were derived from the torah -- judaism's written foundation -- and spelled out in the talmud, the ancient text that provides interpretations of the torah. while those categories make no mention of the earning of money, they do prohibit many activities, such as milking cows, that were primary income generators in ancient times.but it has been up to jewish rabbinical leaders to account for the introduction of technological devices into daily life by issuing responsa, which are written interpretations of the talmud that are intended to provide modern guidelines.observant jews, for example, cannot use cellular phones for business purposes over the sabbath and high holidays. but according to rabbi yitzchok alderstein, a renowned american jewish authority, the passive nature of conducting business on the web has kept jewish scholars from interpreting the relationship between the internet and halacha, the hebrew term for jewish law. nor does he expect them to do so any time soon.\"i think there's a good chance that the issues are not that complex that they require a formal responsum,\" adlerstein says. in addition to serving as director of the jewish studies institute in los angeles and chairman of jewish law & ethics at loyola law school, adlerstein writes a regular column on computer-related issues for the quarterly publication jewish action. even if a rabbi somewhere was to write a responsum, adlerstein says it's quite possible such an interpretation would remain undiscovered for years before being published in any one of dozens of jewish journals. but he says any responsum would certainly take into account the distinction between active and passive.in separating the web from other business tools, adlerstein says it's important to note that the former can be entirely automated. and the talmud includes no mention of prohibiting automated activities, which explains, for instance, why automated dairy farms in israel can continue to operate on the sabbath.judaism's relaxed attitude toward e-commerce is really a matter of semantics. what the torah prohibited were tasks that would interfere with the observance of holy times. jewish leaders later interpreted those texts to imply that jews could not earn money in exchange for services performed on the sabbath or high holidays.so, while a jew who owns vending machines can continue to sell candy bars on the sabbath so long as his machines are stocked, he can not restock those machines until the sabbath has passed. the reason: by selling the restocked candy bars, he would have earned profits that resulted directly from action he took during the sabbath.so, likewise, while a jewish-owned web site can take automated orders for products on the sabbath, the company behind that site cannot fill those orders until after the sabbath.which is why kosher supermarket in new york clearly states on its site that \"orders received on fridays or the day prior to a holiday will be shipped out after the weekend or holiday.\"things are a bit more complicated, adlerstein says, when one web site has a referral arrangement with another. if such a site refers a customer directly to another e-commerce site during the sabbath and that customer makes a purchase at that time, earning a referral fee while also upholding halacha requires a little creativity.edmund publications corp., the orthodox jewish-owned publisher of auto pricing guides, became dependent on such referral revenues after moving the majority of its business to the web. the beverly hills, california company has referral partnerships with auto-related service sites like auto-by-tel and carfinance.com. avi steinlauf, director of marketing and son of edmund's ceo, peter steinlauf, says edmund has structured its partnerships to avoid any potential conflicts with jewish law.\"the revenues are booked across a wider space of time and not on a daily basis, thereby avoiding specific revenue from saturdays and holidays,\" steinlauf says.there are other ways of getting around the issue, too. adlerstein notes that in the case of a business that is structured to earn revenues on the sabbath, a jewish principal can form a partnership with a non-jew, specifying that all profits earned on the sabbath will belong to the non-jewish partner in exchange for the profits from another day of the week.amid all this maneuvering, it might seem that the 24-7 nature of the web is a bad fit for an entrepreneur who happens to be a truly observant jew. but some jews argue that the thoughtful observances of orthodoxy often can prove to be the ideal complement to the fast-paced, around-the-clock web environment.\"there is no reason one needs to compromise his religious and moral beliefs to conduct business on the web,\" says michael eisenberg, an orthodox jewish partner with israel seed, a jerusalem seed venture capital fund that made the majority of its 1998 investments in the e-commerce space. \"i think the religious discipline helps keep one focused in the storm of activity.\"one thing appears certain: any potential conflict between online business practices and the preservation of jewish law isn't keeping many jews away from the web.according to ira jaskoll, associate dean of the sy syms school of business at new york's yeshiva university, the school can barely keep up with the demand for web-related courses. last semester, it had to add a section of its popular internet for business course, and an e-commerce course was offered for the first time.jaskoll stresses that as long as the laws of judaism are applied to the web, jews have no reason to hesitate before making the most of online opportunities.says jaskoll: \"if that's where the action is, then we go there.\""}
