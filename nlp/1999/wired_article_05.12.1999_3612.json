(lycos is now in the process of acquiring wired digital, parent company of wired news.)in ipo action, an internet service provider called biznessonline.com (bizz) surged 18.75 percent to $11.88 after debuting with 2.9 million shares initially priced at $10 each. and online recruitment site careerbuilder (cbdr) was up 23 percent to $16 as it arrived with 4.5 million shares starting at $13.tech stocks found confidence in cisco systems (csco) topping estimates with quarterly profit of 38 cents a share, not to mention announcement of a long-awaited stock split. revenue was up a larger-than-expected 44 percent, indicating that hardware makers aren't facing the dry spell many had feared. cisco's shares advanced $6.87 to $118.75.international business machines (ibm) rose $3.97 to $224.88 on news of a $1 billion contract to supply chips for nintendo's next-generation game system. the deal underlines ibm's new focus as a leading supplier of parts and services, as opposed to finished pcs.microsoft (msft) gained $.50 to $80.38 as investors learned that the software giant may follow up its $5 billion investment in at&t with buying a stake in cable & wireless' cable subsidiary. if so, this would give microsoft a big head start over rivals in establishing windows as the operating system of choice for the world's set-top boxes.for its part, c&w (cwp) slipped $1.18 to $40.44 as the company said its earnings had stalled and likely would drop over coming months. the british telco blamed the setback on increased spending to make its networks more internet-friendly.sony (sne) climbed $.75 to $93.75 after saying it will begin selling music via the net. the company, which bears the responsibility for inflicting mariah carey on an unsuspecting world, will use microsoft's newly developed technology to offer downloadable singles for about $3.50 each. will this cause the demise of free-to-all mp3 tunes? fat chance.more consolidation in the cable industry: cox communications (cox) is purchasing tca cable tv (tcat) for about $3.3 billion, adding to its growing subscriber base in places like texas, arkansas, and louisiana. investors found the deal a little pricey, and cox's share price declined $1.93 to $86.06. tca, on the other hand, was up 15 percent at $60.03.lastly, vermont teddy bear (bear) soared 11 percent to $3.31 after posting quarterly income of 16 cents a share, compared with breaking even a year ago.market cap, which likes to extrapolate larger lessons from such things, is of two minds. on the one hand, a hefty increase in teddy bear purchases could be a good thing because it shows that consumers have plenty of extra cash to spend. on the other, demand for all those extra teddies could be a sign of increased anxiety on the part of the public.maybe it depends on who's doing the buying. if robert rubin went out and bought a fresh bear recently, market cap would be very worried indeed."}
