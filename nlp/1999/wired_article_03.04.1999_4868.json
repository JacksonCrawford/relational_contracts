it is the industry leader that has fueled our recent unprecedented economic miracle, created hundreds of thousands of new jobs to fill those being lost in other sectors of the economy, established america as the global leader in high technology and redefined almost every aspect of our lives and is under siege by a hopelessly timelocked department of justice, whose theory of antitrust was shaped in the '60s, when big business was bad, big government was good, and facts never got in the way of a nice regulatory scheme.microsoft is not the only target of this administration.intel, too, is under attack by a gaggle of anti-free market attorneys at the federal trade commission. the ftc says intel uses its market power to stifle competition in the lucrative chip market. given recent reports that in january, more computers were sold with chips made by one of intel's largest competitors, amd, than with intel chips, the ftc's case seems a bit behind the times. but robert pitofsky and his cohorts press on regardless of the current market situation.holman jenkins summed up the absurdity of the administration's actions quite eloquently in an editorial that appeared in the wall street journal yesterday:\"if joel klein, robert pitofsky and all their little acolytes could catch just one mugger, they would have done something of more value for the country. for that matter, we'd owe the mugger a debt of gratitude for distracting these errant knights from their destructive mission.\"of course, i know the pressures of time and schedules on my colleagues, so, of all the millions of words that have been written about the microsoft trial since its beginning last october, i want them to note just one story, written february 18 on cnet news.com about microsoft's recent roller coaster ride on wall street. the lead paragraph won't take much more than 10 seconds of my colleagues' valuable time, but it tells everything anyone needs to know about this case:\"microsoft shares fell as much as 3.8 percent today,\" the cnet story began, \"on investor concern about threats to the company's dominance from the linux [pronounced like cynics] operating system and the landmark antitrust trial.\"george orwell couldn't have put it better: with competitors baying at its heels, microsoft has been forced to divert enormous resources to defend itself against the government's contention that it has no competitors.actually, george orwell himself would have rejected the travesty of what is basically a private suit brought by the government on behalf of competing multi-billion-dollar companies against their chief competitor especially when the government is heavily vested politically in those companies' success.but, whether orwell would have believed it or not, my colleagues need to believe it, because it's happening, and their constituents don't like it. a poll taken by citizens for a sound economy in january 1999 found that 81 percent of americans - not just washingtonians, but 81 percent of all americans - say that microsoft is good for consumers.a hart/teeter poll also from january found that 73 percent of americans echo that belief and fully two-thirds say the federal government should stay out of the dispute and let the marketplace and consumers decide the fate of competitors in the personal computer industry.and a majority know enough about what's already happening in the industry to understand that the whole expensive circus is moot anyway: 51 percent of americans think that the federal government should just drop the case in the wake of the aol-netscape merger.our constituents are paying attention to this issue because they are consumers and are perfectly aware of how much microsoft has improved their lives. they also see family, friends and neighbors working for companies that depend on microsoft for their existence.there are tens of thousands of companies, large and small, that partner with microsoft, and they are located in every state in the union. i'm sure my colleagues know something about them, but i'm not convinced they are aware of their huge numbers. that's why i asked microsoft for a state-by-state breakdown of their \"partners,\" companies that work directly with or through microsoft or its products. microsoft provided me with the data, which i want to share with my colleagues. [uncover map].microsoft's partners fall into many categories: software retail stores; smaller original equipment manufacturers (oems) that build and sell pc systems with microsoft software preinstalled; corporate account resellers who resell microsoft software to large corporations; providers who sell packaged microsoft software with valueadded consulting services; pc manufacturers; and microsoft certified solution providers.i direct my colleagues' attention to this map that shows the number of these partners in each of their own states. first, the national numbers: microsoft has 7,279 technology partners and 112,819 resale partners.these figures represent companies, not employees. senator murray and i are already well aware of washington's 2,637 resale partners and 254 technology partners.our state's economy is absolutely booming and it's due not only to the presence of microsoft itself, but to the thousands of other companies that microsoft supports. companies like technology express of bothell and techpower solutions incorporated of redmond.but i wonder if my other colleagues have stopped to consider what justice's assault on microsoft might do to their own state's economies and jobs and how their constituents might feel about that impact. let's look at utah as an example. utah is home to 64 technology partners and 1153 resale partners of microsoft home to real people working in real jobs for real companies. companies like pc innovation incorporated in salt lake city and vitrex corporation of ogden. despite these facts, the senior senator from utah, the distinguished chairman of the senate judiciary committee, has chosen to take the side of the justice department and to support the administration's efforts to squelch the freedom of companies in his own state to innovate.my colleagues should talk with consumers about their views of technology, because as my fellow senators begin to understand how the technology business works, they will discover consumers not only have not been harmed by microsoft, but have benefitted: innovation is booming, choices are growing, and prices are falling for all software.microsoft is leading an industry that the old school department of justice just doesn't understand. there are none of the traditional barriers to entry in the high-tech industry that have historically motivated antitrust enforcement.this market moves at the speed of ideas and a good idea can cause a company to lose 90 percent of market share overnight precisely what happened to oncedominant products such as wordstar and word perfect; precisely what could happen to microsoft.this justice department, led by joel klein, is brazen about its desire to intervene in markets, even when it knows little about the markets it meddles with. \"surgical intervention\" is the spin that klein and his department have coined to describe its interventionist approach.to recap the recent history of this misguided lawsuit, the original charge that microsoft illegally tied internet browsing to its operating system was rejected before the trial even began by a 3 member court of appeals ruling that recognized that putting internet explorer technologies into windows '95 was a beneficial integration, not a monopolistic tiein.the court even admonished klein and cohorts not to try tinkering with software design and warned them to be wary of intruding into marketplace innovation and product design.a mere week before the court of appeals ruling came out, the department of justice filed its current lawsuit against windows 98...a product even more integrated than windows 95.for this trial, klein and company simply changed tactics. instead of arguing the case on its legal merits, the justice department has engaged in an all-out public relations battle. the new pr strategy has been orchestrated under joel klein's watch and has been the primary strategy in the courtroom as well.the government's lead lawyer, mr. boies (pronounced like boys), has a few aggressive email messages that showed microsoft to be exactly the fiercely competitive entity that has engendered its impressive market performance, but nothing more sinister. mr. boies uses these same pieces of email over and over again in highly theatrical ways to try and embarrass and intimidate microsoft's witnesses.at breaks in the trial every day, the government turns the courthouse steps into ground zero for its spin game knowing full well its legal strategy had failed before it ever left the gate.despite their shaky legal case, the press has recently reported that justice department officials and the attorneys general from 19 states suing microsoft are already discussing post trial \"remedies.\" before any decision has been made in the case, antitrust division officials are contemplating punishments.before they have proven any consumer harm, they are devising consumer remedies. before they have made closing arguments, they have coined a cute catch phrase for their planned breakup of the company. they call the tiny remnants of the future broken microsoft they already have the hubris to predict \"baby bills.\"whatever happened to letting justice take its course? are we to assume that the outcome of the trial is a forgone conclusion? why are we wasting taxpayer money on attorneys fees when all that is really going on is a show trial?on the other hand, microsoft has put on a very strong record in this case in areas relevant to the law and the claims brought by the government: tying law, foreclosure of product through exclusionary contracts and the fundamental element of consumer harm.the facts so far in the record show microsoft to be on firm legal ground in all these areas. the appeals court verified there was no illegal tying. james barksdale, netscape's ceo, admitted that microsoft did not foreclose his company from the market. and the government's final witness, economist franklin fisher, testified that, on balance, microsoft has not harmed consumers.as attorney general for washington state, i argued 14 cases before the united states supreme court. my focus as attorney general was consumer protection. i want to assure my colleagues today that, had this case been presented to me as an attorney general, i wouldn't have given it a second glance because there is no evidence whatsoever that microsoft has harmed consumers.but joel klein doesn\ufffdt care about protecting consumers.he cares about protecting companies that cannot compete on their own. in a recent speech, he stated that it was the job of antitrust to \"reallocate resources between the producer and the consumer.\"really? to reallocate resources? that's what antitrust is for?well, i agree with mr. klein's assessment on one count: this trial was designed precisely to reallocate resources from microsoft to microsoft's competitors. and why would the department want to do that?perhaps because the resources the administration really wants to reallocate are california's electoral votes into al gore's column come the year 2000. just this past tuesday the san francisco chronicle said that mr. gore \"unabashedly acknowledged that he has lavished attention on california, which carries a rich cache of votes - and campaign donors. according to his staff, the vice president has visited the state 53 times since taking office five years ago.\" in a separate story, the chronicle quotes the vice-president as saying, \"california is the biggest, most important state....it deserves the most attention, and i'm going to make sure it gets it.\"so, needing california in 2000, lusting for a return to the regulatory excess needed to feed the insatiable maw of big government, and wanting to throw trial lawyers some fresh meat, but lacking anything closely resembling a credible legal case, what have klein and co. done? they've demonized the most innovative, extraordinary worldchanging engine for progress that this world may ever have seen. as my colleagues think about the implications of our failure to protest this demonization, let's just take a closer look at the \"demon\" itself and see what innovations the forces of government regulatory mediocrity are about to foreclose.microsoft's economic contributions already are common knowledge, and i've just provided the statebystate breakdown, but here's a refresher: in the fiscal year ending june 30, 1998, microsoft's net revenues were 14.48 billion dollars - 56 percent of which came from international trade. in my home state of washington, by the end of 1998 microsoft employed almost 16,000 workers.nationwide the figure was almost 20,000 -- and that's without factoring in the number of jobs represented by the 120,000 plus companies on the partners' map i've just shown my colleagues. microsoft generates jobs worldwide as well, with subsidiaries in nearly 60 countries, from austria to viet nam, costa rica to the czech and slovak republics, saudi arabia to south africa.national productivity and workplace efficiency? the value provided is very nearly beyond our ability to calculate. ironically, windows, the product portrayed by klein and cohorts as anticonsumer, was purposely designed by microsoft to support and encourage the greatest number of innovations possible by independent software programmers, who need a uniform, broadbased platform on which to write code (this should be singular) that will be economically viable in smaller niche markets. the result has been an enormous proliferation of software designed to fill every imaginable consumer need.how about other, less obvious innovations this company is responsible for?let's start with products that just make life better for ordinary people, like webtv, which lets people use their television sets to connect to the internet. that's innovation for the better. and there's also windows' accessibility features magnifiers, highcontrast schemes, special keys and sound enhancements among many that make computers easy to use for many people with disabilities opening doors that previously were locked tight. education? microsoft donates millions of dollars in cash and software to schools and libraries every year.microsoft was recently voted the 3rd most admired company in fortune's annual poll.that's some demon the justice department has targeted. it had better hurry and shut microsoft down completely or the next thing you know microsoft will help lower the cost of computing even more or spawn even greater technological and cultural innovations that will make our lives easier and better, and then where would we be?mr. president, irony aside, there is no aspect of this case that does not offend me.as a lawyer, i have nothing but contempt for the flaccid pr case hoisted feebly in judge thomas penfield jackson's court by the government's inquisitors. as a former attorney general who left a solid legacy of consumer protection, i am appalled at the orwellian doublespeak government lawyers spew forth as they pretend to act on behalf of consumers while simultaneously seeking to dictate what they may consume.as a freemarket advocate of decadeslong standing, i am chagrined at the \"damn-the-consequences, full-speed-backward!\" attitude of those who would regulate just for regulation and bureaucracy's sake.as a senator, i am nonplused at the administration's gall in asking for a 16 percent increase to beef up its attackdog department so that it may continue mauling the greatest engine for revenue generation we've seen in many a year.as a washingtonian, i am incensed at the blatant attempt by al gore's wannabe administration to court my state's electoral votes even as his current administration's justice department orchestrates the destruction of washington's superb economic engine in favor of silicon valley's greater financial and electoral prize.yes, mr. president, this case offends me in every sense of the word, as it should offend every one of my colleagues. i call on each of them today to recognize what is at risk here, to rise above partisan posturing, to recognize the outrageous nature of the justice department's power grab, and to join me in stopping it.because that is precisely what i intend to do: i will seek to stop the justice department's grab for more funding through the appropriations committee when there are basic law enforcement needs going unfunded. i intend to conduct congressional oversight authority of the department's out-of-control antitrust division in every committee in which it is appropriate, and i will seek out every other legitimate vehicle to provide congressional control of this out-of-control, timewarped throwback to the 60s.i call on my colleagues to join me today in demanding accountability from a justice department that asserts consumer harm in the presence of consumer bounty; that has sought to destroy competition in the name of competition; and that now seeks to increase its own battle force with taxpayer dollars for a undertaking that taxpayers do not want undertaken.this is a justice department out of control, and not only with respect to microsoft. they're also going after visa and mastercard. their equally hidebound colleagues at the ftc are suing chip manufacturer, intel, and investigating router (pronounced rowter) manufacturer, cisco.most absurd of all, the department of justice of the united states of america has accused the country's leading manufacturer of false teeth (dentsply) of illegally maintaining a monopoly.no wonder justice is asking for more money and more lawyers; it needs to find more teeth to feed its rapidly burgeoning lawsuit habit.mr. president, the department of justice seeks to fix what is not broken, to intervene where innovation has been the unchallenged king, and to shunt off to a dead-end track the principal engine of america's technological leadership of the world.the department of justice, not microsoft, must be stopped."}
