(and according to searchwords.com, if aspiring pornhounds learned to spell \"bestiality\" properly, it would climb to the top five.)after the aclu's final witness, earthlink security expert dan farmer, finishes testifying, the government will begin to present its case in defense of copa.the first witness is scheduled to be damon hecker, an agent in the air force's office of special investigations. his unsurprising claim: there's plenty of porn online.to drive home the point, hecker has gathered a collection of web pages with titles ranging from free porn movies to young pussy that he plans to highlight for us district judge lowell a. reed.the american civil liberties union, representing the plaintiffs challenging copa, argues that the law is unnecessary. according to an attorney familiar with hecker's pretrial deposition, each of the sex sites the special agent unearthed was blocked by at least one filtering program -- a point the aclu will likely raise during cross-examination.the aclu argues that filtering software is a less intrusive way of shielding children from smut than a federal criminal law.the government also plans to call laith paul alsarraf, who runs adultcheck.com and makes a living selling adult ids to the porn industry -- and doesn't seem to mind copa's big boost to his bottom line.during a house subcommittee hearing on copa last september, alsarraf testified that signing up for his system is quick and easy: simply place a script at the entrance to a web site that will request visitors enter an adult id to continue.don't have one? if you've got a credit card handy, there's no problem at all, said alsarraf, who is ceo of cybernet ventures, inc.judge reed said he would hold a hearing friday morning to decide whether to kick the public out of the courtroom, a move the aclu has requested. the group's attorneys say they want to protect confidential business information.that information is most likely to come to light during the testimony of the government's fourth witness, brian blonder, a partner at pricewaterhousecoopers who will testify about the financial impact of copa.a coalition of news organizations on thursday requested to intervene in the case, arguing the public should have \"access to what it clearly is entitled to know.\"\"having chosen to bring this lawsuit, plaintiffs now wish to deny the press and public access to judicial records and proceedings,\" says the document submitted by attorney amy ginensky on behalf of wired news, usa today, the associated press, msnbc, and the new york times. american lawyer media on thursday filed a separate but similar request."}
