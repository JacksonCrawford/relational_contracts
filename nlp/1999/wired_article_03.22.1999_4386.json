america online (aol) is doing it for them. netscape's new papa could dump as much as 20 percent of the company's 2,500 employees, the wall street journal reported, with a \"broad reorganization\" now in the works. this could include a number of netscape programmers receiving pink slips, and the company's netcenter resources being combined with aol's online operations.traders, typically, think all this belt-tightening is swell, and pushed aol's stock $10.75 higher to $130. separately, ing baring furman selz reiterated a \"strong buy\" rating for aol's shares, which the broker expects to reach $180 within nine months.from the rumor mill: broadcast.com (bcst) surged 37 percent to $116.50 after business week cited an unidentified source as saying the company is in talks to be acquired by yahoo. if so, the deal would be sweet music for broadcast.com's early investors, who have watched their shares triple in value since the company went public in july. yahoo (yhoo) was $5 lower at $165.in tech, dell computer (dell) fell $2.38 to $37.88 after donaldson, lufkin & jenrette securities cut its earnings estimate for the company. analyst kevin mccarthy said he expects dell to ship fewer pcs this quarter, and thus foresees the company earning just 15 cents a share. the street's consensus estimate is a penny higher.international business machines (ibm) dipped $1.38 to $167.19 as bancboston robertson stephens slashed its first-quarter earnings estimate for big blue to $1.37 a share from $1.42. still, the brokerage maintained a long-term \"attractive\" rating for the company's shares.mediaone group (umg) jumped 13 percent to $68.69 on news that it will be purchased for about $60 billion by comcast (cmcsa). the merger would create america's third-largest cable concern, after time warner and at&t's tele-communications inc., with about 11 million subscribers. this didn't sit well with investors, though, and comcast's stock tumbled $5.38 to $64.75.on the other hand, traders were pleased as pie with how continuing consolidation in the cable business will affect internet service provider at home (athm). the cable-based isp climbed $6.19 to $140 on hopes that such marriages will bode well for purveyors of high-speed access.similarly, cnet (cnet) gained $5.38 to $93.25 after launching a new online directory aimed at users with warp-speed web access. the directory, a joint venture with nbc, will be jam-packed with the sort of audio and video content that can frazzle a lesser dial-up connection.in finance, merrill lynch (mer) slipped 81 cents to $89.94 after pouring cold water on speculation that the securities house may merge with chase manhattan bank. however, merrill ceo david komansky reportedly told analysts that his company may consider hitching up with a commercial bank at some point in the future. chase (cmb) was 56 cents lower at $81.94.lastly, diet maven jenny craig (jc) is looking to get fat on the internet. the operator of weight-loss clinics soared 31 percent to $4.50 as it revamped its web site and said it will peddle a new line of nutritional supplements only via the net.what, they figure we're all just sitting around in front of the computer all day? what would give them that idea?"}
