tracking individuals' listening habits. the company will issue a software patch, but privacy advocates call for government participation. by leander kahney.", "author": "leander kahney", "category":

collection practices. privacy advocates say it's a start, but that more action is needed. truste pledged to investigate realnetwork's practice of surreptitiously gathering data about the music listening habits of its users.truste launched the investigation in response to a report published in the new york times that realnetwork's realjukebox software monitors users' listening habits and other activities and sends the information and the user's identity to the company.according to the times article, the software extracts a personal serial number known as a globally unique identifier, or guid, from the user's machines, and passes it on to realnetworks servers.the software reportedly snoops on the number of songs on the user's hard drive and the formats they are stored in. most importantly, it associates the data with a unique serial number that can identify the user\"we're deeply concerned,\" said dave steer, a spokesman for truste.steer said if the company is found to be in breach of its privacy contract and policy, truste may strip it of its trustmark seal, granted by truste to web sites displaying and following a privacy policy. in addition, truste may decide to report its findings to the federal trade commission or sue for breach of contract, he said.truste is an industry-sponsored nonprofit organization meant to assure compliance with certain web privacy standards in lieu of government regulation. truste has previously investigated microsoft for security concerns over its hotmail service and storing guids in office documents.realjukebox software is used by 13.5 million people to play music on computers and can copy music to a user's hard drive.dave richards, realnetworks' vice president for consumer products, acknowledged that the company gathered the information to customize service for individual users. realnetworks representatives said the practice did not violate consumer privacy because the data was not stored by the company or released to other companies.tom frank, realnetworks chief operating officer, said the company would be issuing a software patch later monday that would prevent the software from sending user data to its servers.frank said the data-collection feature would be taken out of future products.\"obviously, we care a great deal about the privacy concerns of our users or we would not have reacted as decisively and swiftly as we have,\" he said.frank admitted it was a mistake to have built the capability into the product in the first place, and that it was only intended to aggregate data and not profile individual consumers.but privacy advocate jason catlett, founder and president of junkbusters, wasn't impressed.\"truste has proven to be more of a lapdog than a watchdog,\" catlett said. \"i'll be much more excited when the fbi starts an investigation.\"noting that truste was set up by the online industry as a self-regulatory tool to stave off privacy legislation from washington, catlett said the organization was unwilling to get tough and had little clout anyway.\"will the truste remedy of revoking a seal deliver a crushing blow to company's operations?\" he asked, then answered his own question. \"the answer is 'no.'\"catlett said that realnetworks changed its truste-endorsed privacy policy over the weekend to acknowledge for the first time that it uses the unique serial numbers.however, he noted that the company didn't fully disclose how it used the serial numbers, saying only that they are used to personalize services and gather usage statistics.\"it's a small step towards glasnost,\" he said. \"but they've still got a long way to go.\"catlett sent an open letter to realnetworks demanding the company fully disclose its secretive data gathering practices, copying the new york state attorney general's office, which has shown an interest in protecting consumers online.\"we can't comment on particular investigations,\" said spokeswoman juanita scarlett, \"but we're looking at internet privacy, period.\"security expert richard smith originally discovered that the user data was being passed to the realnetworks servers. he intercepted and examined the information generated by the realjukebox.smith said that as well as monitoring music preferences, the realnetworks software could also be used to see if people were downloading illegal mp3 files.however, he noted authorities would have go through a number of steps to track pirates, matching unique serial numbers recorded at download time with a list of the individuals associated with those numbers.he said he was more worried by the unsettling precedent set by the realnetworks software.\"the program is way too talkative,\" he said. \"it sends out much too much information about you and that needs to stop. i'd hate to think what happens when my tv set, my radio, my dvd player, and my stereo all start reporting on me.\"reuters contributed to this report."}
