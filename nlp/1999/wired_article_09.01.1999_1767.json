also, tell him that i said bullies come disguised in many costumes. some even wear the garb of objective journalists.__ leonard riggiofounder and ceo, barnes & noble inc. __so barnes & noble is going to reinvent itself, and books as well, to regain mindshare. let's examine the proposition: the company has been clever, in a schoolyard-bully sort of way, locating its faceless discount stores next to successful local bookstores, destroying them with its high-volume, low-margin approach. not exactly rocket science.word to barnes & noble: you are a dinosaur. you've had a fine time stomping all over your smaller, weaker competition, but the comet that is the internet has smacked your planet.your idea of replacing books through technology is not new - and isn't even good. books are cheap, are extremely portable, require absolutely no power, and transport the reader to vivid worlds through the vehicle of the human imagination. you think you can top that?__ mark w. rothsmarkroths@aol.com __could it be that kinko's is the real beneficiary of barnes & noble's plans for on-demand printing?__ shawn netjesnetjes@yahoo.com __jonathan bulkeley, barnesandnoble.com's ceo, states that a book is \"just data.\" albert greco, a business professor at fordham university, states that publishers \"can't wait to go electronic\" because \"there's nothing to print.\" these are appalling statements.form and content are inseparable, and the dismal interface of current ebooks spoils the experience of reading electronic texts. we are a long way from an ebook interface that matches print.__ darrell judddjudd@artechhouse.com ____ better bandwidth __in response to \"the ultimate bandwidth index\" (wired 7.05, page 72): i've been using a cable modem for the last six months. its download speed becomes progressively slower as more and more people go online. in the evening, the cable modem can be as sluggish as a dialup 56-kbps modem. i installed a dsl when it became available and find it faster and more reliable than my cable connection. to suggest that a cable modem's value is eight times greater than that of the dsl is grossly inaccurate.__ alex gershcoldfish@pacbell.net ____ being digital __in \"being rural\" (wired 7.06, page 94), nicholas negroponte suggests that the digital infrastructure will permit us to dismantle our dirty, stinking cities and move to the countryside.meanwhile, my own city of boston has one of the lowest vacancy rates in recent history, is putting up new luxury housing at a remarkable rate, and is - or so say the newspapers - likely to top 600,000 residents for the first time in more than two decades.will telecommunications change the city? doubtless. kill it? i suspect not.__ michael feelymrf@homeport.org __what exactly does nicholas negroponte think happens to rural areas when people leave cities to live in the country? the countryside becomes suburbia, and the rural areas disappear beneath housing and shopping malls.i watched it happen in the semirural area where i grew up, and that's exactly why i left. we sold the big house in a \"prestigious\" suburban community, happily trading life in a cultural desert for the richer environs of philadelphia.__ elizabeth c. scheyderscheydec@sas.upenn.edu ____ jargonitis __a mild nausea descended upon me when i read the word \"meatspace,\" the name of the column on meeting places outside cyberspace (\"hang time,\" wired 7.06, page 84). it suggests the sexualization of women and also reminds me of upton sinclair's novel the jungle, which can turn the hardiest carnivore into a vegetarian after the first few pages. can you put your brains together and come up with another term? until then, i'll keep some pepto-bismol nearby.__ linda safarlilindsafa@kcls.org ____ false profit __gary wolf mistakes john templeton's equanimity for spirituality (\"sir john's divine gamble,\" wired 7.06, page 170). might templeton be a cutthroat capitalist with good manners? his investment strategy - look for the \"point of maximum pessimism\" - could be easily rephrased as \"don't buy till there's blood on the floor.\"now that he's old and filthy rich, he's funding studies to justify his life, to prove that wealth equals virtue. there's nothing terribly spiritual about that. better he should spend his money to alleviate the suffering of some of capitalism's victims: there are plenty of them.__ john c. granniscrossroads@viconet.com ____ seeds of doubt __i was thrilled by \"the wired index\" (wired 7.06, page 99) - then dismayed to see two of its members: wal-mart and monsanto. an index trying to lead the way to the future cannot include such backward-thinking companies.as bad as wal-mart is, nothing can truly compare with the sin (and i do not use this word lightly) against nature that monsanto is perpetrating with its \"terminator\" seeds, which are genetically engineered to germinate for only one growing season. genetic engineering may well be an important aspect of the 21st century, but seed propagation and royalty-free farming deserve the same protection we afford speech.__ aaron j. harveyaharvey@frognet.net ____ for the record __what the advocates of mp3 (\"real's deal,\" wired 7.06, page 82) and free music don't seem to realize is that the advent of perfect digital copies signifies not only the end of record labels but quite possibly the end of creative music.record companies serve an important role. they filter out the drivel, selecting the most talented musicians and helping them reach an audience that would otherwise be dependent on word of mouth or blind luck to find the gems among a sea of white noise.__ john chaojchao@rice.edu ____ bell hop __in \"roam free\" (wired 7.06, page 202) steve bodow suggests that, for many people, there's little reason to have a landline when pcs rates are so cheap. i took the leap a year ago, and i'll never go back. the key: get in early with a startup. thanks to my provider's initial na\u00efvet\u00e9, i pay just $50 a month for unlimited calls. combine that with a 384-kbps wireless data connection, and it's buh-bye, ma bell.__ waldo l. jaquithwaldo@wamdesign.com ____ one hand clapping __\"watch it\" (wired 7.06, page 158) included an incorrect and oddly critical characterization of the fcc's role in setting digital-television standards. the fcc adopted the modulation, transport, and compression layers of an industry-developed dtv broadcasting standard, but, largely at the request of the pc industry, did not adopt the so-called scanning layer. rather than erroneously slam the fcc standard as \"little more than an assortment of evolving digital-video formats,\" digerati should applaud the government's decision to let industry and consumers choose the best formats.__ paul misener, senior legal adviser and chief of staff to fcc commissioner harold furchtgott-rothpmisener@fcc.gov ____ open sources __after reading \"the public face of linux\" (wired 7.06, page 197), i was left with the impression that linux wouldn't be ready for nontechnical consumers \"until [they] can buy a home computer pre-installed with linux, gnome, and a software suite....\" greed and impatience led me to dig up the facts: www.linux.org/vendors/systems.html lists dozens of vendors worldwide that sell machines with linux pre-installed, complete with a suite of applications.i'm not an open source zealot - just a guy looking for a good deal. a stable, virtually free os that comes loaded with software is just that.__ paul dwyermixtec@hotmail.com ____ undo __out of stock: the ticker symbol for nokia (\"the wired index,\" wired 7.06, page 113) changed from noka to nok after the issue went to press.__ send your rants & raves to: __email: rants@wiredmag.comsnail mail: wired, po box 191826 san francisco, ca 94109-9866editorial guidelines: guidelines@wiredmag.comeditorial correspondence: editor@wiredmag.com"}
