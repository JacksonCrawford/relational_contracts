if not, power down. but a wireless lan is sensed nearby, so networking hardware is powered up. computing tasks are simple at the moment, so off with the pentium pack. flip on the global positioning circuitry only when the user changes location.\"you end up with a lower-power system that's going 'hm -- is everybody happy? ... you've scaled the machine based on contextual awareness,\" schwartz said.that kind of design will become important if wearables are to overcome the big obstacle of expensive power. \"power is expensive -- in cost, weight, and convenience,\" schwartz said.minimize those factors, and wearables become smaller and lighter -- and more wearable -- sooner than moore's law might allow.three-time symposium attendee phillippe van nedervelde noted to colleagues gathered at his monday lunch that many of the exhibits sported technologies that hadn't dramatically advanced since the first symposium three years ago.having arrived in san francisco fresh from a nanotechnology conference, he wondered whether the wait for wearables to get wearable might not one day be pre-empted by breakthroughs in another field: nanotechnology, where electronic circuits and devices are designed and built at the molecular level. a circuit could be part of our fingers, arms, and skin.that will take care of the question of how to fit a pc in a shirt, he said, or conceal a password in a special ring or bracelet. \"you want my pin number?\" he asked. \"it's in my stomach.\""}
