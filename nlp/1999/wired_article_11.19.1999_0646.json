given current technology, perhaps. but police in scotland are already taking dna from people stopped for any crime, even traffic offenses. london police say they hope to be using handheld dna scanners within 10 years.the privacy implications are staggering.unlike \"mug shot\" photos and ink-and-paper fingerprinting, dna identification involves taking human tissue. but few safeguards for it exist: of the 50 us states that demand dna from criminals, only three prohibit the unauthorized release of that genetic material.some medical ethicists say that dna samples are more intrusive than photos or fingerprints because human genomes reveal information about health risks, race, and paternity.currently, the fbi's vast database only records data about so-called \"junk\" dna -- areas of human genes that include biologically unimportant information. but if police store tissue samples, as many now do, the human cells could be re-tested in the future for more information.\"that's where the pressure is coming right now: to add [those] markers,\" says eric juengst, a case western reserve university biomedical ethicist who is a member of the fbi's dna advisory panel. \"it's law enforcement. what they would like to do is have markers present.\"those markers could include race, gender, physical characteristics, potential psychiatric disorders -- in short, anything that can be linked to specific genes.if race is included in the database, juengst says it could lead to a new form of genetic racism and away from a colorblind society.\"it's that question of are we willing to expand information we collect about people beyond the [simple] pattern of identification like a regular manual fingerprint,\" he says.dna taken from a crime scene can reveal physical characteristics about a person: blood or hair follicles could indicate the suspect is a white man with blue eyes and blond hair who's probably short and left-handed.it can also reveal information about your family. most labs use nucleic analysis, which uses dna taken from the cell nucleus. but in 1996 the fbi set up a forensic lab to do mitochondrial analysis using the more plentiful dna found outside the nucleus.the procedure is less precise. when mitochondrial dna is tested, your profile is usually identical to that of your mother, siblings, and grandmother.\"[it] does not provide the same high degree of unique dna information that traditional nucleic dna fingerprinting does because all of a woman's offspring have the same mitochondrial dna sequence, and the offspring will share that same mitochondrial dna with all their material relatives for many generations. thus, it is easy to see how a dna databank ... has implications not only for the banked offender, but also for his or her non-banked relatives,\" attorney michelle hibbert writes in a recent wake forest law review article.relatives could be unfairly targeted by police if that form of genetic testing becomes widespread.the us national academy of sciences in 1990 recommended that all samples be destroyed promptly after analysis. but law enforcement representatives oppose such a requirement.police databases may be expanded in the future. the international association of police chiefs has asked congress to require dna samples from anyone arrested, and new york city mayor rudolph giuliani has requested that the state legislature require dna samples from every newborn baby. a louisiana law that took effect on 1 september 1999 requires dna to be taken from people arrested -- but not necessarily convicted -- of a violent crime.once the genome has been completely mapped -- when all three billion units of dna are located and identified -- researchers can use that information to develop genetic therapy. and police will have more details about criminal suspects than ever before.the human genome project had expected to finish mapping the human gene by 2003, but this week a private company said it could be complete by the end of next year."}
