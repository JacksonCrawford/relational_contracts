and their shareholders - the majors have recognized the need to jump into the game with clear strategies and quick reflexes.it's early yet. sdmi (secure digital music initiative) is just warming up, and the rules of the market are being rewritten by high tech and consumer electronics rivalries. but as music-industry paranoia gives way to aggressive moves, look forward to cool stuff like custom compilations and multimedia liner notes. and watch for the reactors to become actors.after parent company seagram bought polygram in 1998, universal (led by ceo doug morris) became the industry's 800-pound gorilla. its roster includes a&m, decca, def jam, deutsche grammophon, dreamworks, geffen, island, mercury, mca, motown, philips classics, polydor, polygram, and verve. universal studios controls movies and more.\"there's no way to combat music on the web without a commercial alternative,\" says universal music group exec larry kenswil.the vision \"the upside of mp3 is that it's exposing artists and creating a buzz about bands,\" says kenswil. \"the bad part is that it's an unprotected format. it eliminates all sense that people who work for a living writing and preparing this stuff should get paid.\"we need a digital distribution system that allows for hit records. our dream is that digital distribution ultimately represents half the market. basically, the marketplace doubles.\" getmusic.com, an ecommerce venture launched with bmg last april, will command a dreamy 40 percent market share.the good news in may, universal partnered with intertrust technologies, whose digibox software provides copyright protection, supports sdmi standards, and allows for \"tell-a-friend\" distribution. universal also established the vast emd digital network along with at&t, matsushita, and bmg this spring.the bad news universal - which distributes more than half a billion cds a year - will have to invest tens of millions of dollars in a digital asset-management system just to make sense of its enormous inventory. \"we have it on the very fast track,\" says kenswil. \"unfortunately, the initial outlay is going to be immense.\"the trash talk \"[seagram president and ceo] edgar bronfman jr. may be the visionary of big music, but he's also the guy who in 1997 dismissed the internet as 'the cb radio of the '90s.'\"the takeaway if they can wrestle all that content into usable formats, these guys will be masters of the universe.owned by bertelsmann ag (and led by strauss zelnick), the bmg team includes arista, arista latin, arista nashville, bad boy, bmg classics, jive, laface, loud, rca, and windham hill. additional holdings include publishing, tv, software, and interests in net companies such as aol and lycos.\"we've always been big believers in the internet,\" says kevin conroy, the senior vp, who spins bmg's web strategy. \"i went to strauss four years ago and laid out a vision, and he said, 'go for it.'\"the vision \"the internet's all about opportunities,\" says conroy. \"we've been actively involved in the creation of sdmi, and expect a legitimate market for digital distribution to begin to emerge in the fourth quarter of 1999.\"less than 2 percent of releases are commercially successful. there's a basic marketing problem - the industry isn't connecting its artists with their fans. to me that says we need to use the internet as a bridge.\"bmg's getmusic.com partnership with universal increased the pool of digital content. bmg is also a member of the new emd digital network initiative.the good news \"we might be slow in coming to digital distribution,\" says arista executive vp charles goldstuck, \"but that won't hurt our business. what will hurt our business is if we step too fast and find ourselves exposed without any way of stepping back. instead, we'll see what the rest of the world does, and skip a few steps.\"the bad news the company's interests in cd and cassette manufacturing make it unlikely that bmg will adopt purely digital distribution.the trash talk \"getmusic.com is going to do nothing. bmg was bleeding red ink and convinced universal to write it a check. i don't know if you've ever been in a 50/50 deal where the partners don't trust each other or necessarily have the same goal, but it's not pleasant.\"the takeaway bmg's web presence is ok, but it's the partnership with universal that's yanked it higher in the standings.the japanese giant's us music arm (run by tommy mottola) includes columbia, epic, 550 music, legacy, razor sharp, refugee camp, relativity, ruffhouse, sony/atv, sony wonder, so so def, and untertainment. sony's interests span electronics, software, and information technology.\"we started strategic discussions in 1994,\" says senior vp fred ehrlich. \"we're very happy with the progress we're making. but we're just in the beginning, far from the finish line.\"the vision \"i don't like to make predictions in public,\" ehrlich avers. \"what i would feel comfortable stating is that 10 years from now traditional record stores will exist alongside virtual offerings.\"just because you have the ability to self-publish doesn't mean you will be successful. right now there are various sites, like mp3.com, that might have 10,000 artists. but how do people know who's on them? record companies add tremendous value, and we will continue to add tremendous value.\"the good news sony is partnering with microsoft to sell and distribute music using windows media technologies 4.0 this year. \"right now we're talking only about singles,\" says ehrlich. \"over time, the expectation is to make a considerable number of titles available.\"the bad news the last thing sony music needs is to get dragged into a format war. but word is that sony electronics is hoping to establish its flash memory stick as the memory standard for portable digital music devices.the trash talk \"it'd be one thing if sony created a music brand, but it's building a corporate brand, and i don't know if that cuts it. it's sort of a portal strategy. but at the end of the day, if it's not hip, if consumers don't find it relevant, what's the point?\"the takeaway sony's dual interests - music and hardware - might clash, handicapping the company. then again, they might come together to produce a dominant player.owned by the emi group (run by ken berry), the british power has relationships with blue note, capitol, caroline, priority, virgin, and emi classics, not to mention its dozens of international divisions.\"it's the most exciting time for the music industry since the birth of vinyl,\" says jay samit, emi's senior vp of new media. \"on a scale of 0 to 10, we're at 1 or 2. it's a long road. but our goal is to make it happen within 12 months. one hundred thousand songs online by christmas? no problem.\"the vision \"if you believe fundamentally in a creative culture,\" says vice president jeremy silver, \"then you also have to believe in the right of those who create the cultural materials to be rewarded for that creativity.\"\"we're going to simultaneously try many different business models,\" says samit, \"and consumers will tell us by their actions what they like. we're thinking beyond the album as the sole model of how music is aggregated.\"the good news \"emi is the world's largest pure music company,\" notes samit, a net veteran who recently defected from universal. \"other studios get mired down with all the competing divisions. but emi can move quickly and really do things. it's like a startup that just happens to have giant market share and billions of dollars.\"the bad news samit may have the vision, but he just joined the team in april. the exec's spin that \"emi spent no money going down the wrong path\" doesn't change the fact that the company is way late to the game.the trash talk \"emi is really nowhere - nowhere. the company was being sold, not being sold; they lost market share. they've got some things going on at individual labels like capitol. but there's no company focus.\"the takeaway with good leadership and sharp focus, emi is a dark horse to watch in the last furlong.time warner's music division (led by bob daly and terry semel) consists of atlantic, elektra, maverick, reprise, rhino, sub pop, and warner bros. not to mention time warner's interests in movies, tv, cable, ted turner, and the looney tunes gang.executive vp paul vidich steers warner's net strategy.execs spoke on the condition they not be quoted directly. warner's most digital plans to date: move the direct-marketing power columbia house, owned jointly with sony, into ecommerce.the vision sure, once bandwidth increases and secure standards are adopted, digital distribution will be big, but for now company wisdom is that people don't want to experience the technology; they want to experience the music. warner's near-term digital strategy amounts to dvd surround-sound audio discs. it sees the internet primarily as a marketing tool, gathering consumer information and making the sale of cds, dvds, videotapes, and games more efficient.the good news warner mainstay tom petty posted a free promotional track at mp3.com, generating lots of positive press. fans downloaded more than 150,000 copies.the bad news warner talked petty into ending the mp3 promo after two days. and alanis morissette's ongoing infatuation with mp3 has done little to calm the most paranoid warner execs - the company's been dragging its corporate feet.the trash talk \"warner is run by movie guys. i don't know how much power the music guys have behind them. also, warner music is very decentralized - the labels compete heavily against each other, and they don't like corporate guys telling them what to do.\"the takeaway time's a-wastin'. warner needs to adopt a few plays from alanis' book.the top 5 countdownintroductionuniversal music groupbmg entertainmentsony musicemiwarner music group"}
