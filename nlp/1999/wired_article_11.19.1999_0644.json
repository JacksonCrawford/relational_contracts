they're trying to protect their assets. opponents insist the cable companies want to monopolize net content. by joyce slaton.", "author": "joyce slaton", "category": "security", "type": "article", "timestamp": "11.19.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "the promise of broadband has been whispered about for years, spawning geek dreams of lightning-fast net access -- a dramatic improvement over slowpoke dial-up connections. broadband is on its way all right. but vitriolic debates over broadband delivery are holding up the works. that makes consumer advocates and cable companies very nervous.on one side are the cable companies trying to build and operate closed networks with upgraded lines accessible only to their own or partner isps. on the other side are consumer groups, isps, and phone companies, all of which want broadband cable lines open to any provider willing to pay line usage fees, just like the phone company/dial-up isp model.that's a bad idea, according to cable companies like media one and at&t, which recently swallowed up tci.\"forced access may be good for our competitors, but it will be very bad for our customers who want the cheapest, fastest service possible,\" claimed at&t's director of law and government affairs michael morris at a recent san francisco public hearing on the issue. \"in truth, the forced-access requirement was not conceived to help customers. it was conceived by and for the benefit of our competitors.\"cable companies claim competition between up-and-coming broadband delivery methods like dsl, wireless communications, cable, and satellite technology is enough to improve the bottom line for consumers. they also maintain that too much regulation too soon will stifle investments, cause technological snafus, and create a \"regulatory nightmare\" that could slow services and raise prices for everybody.their opponents vociferously refute these arguments.\"the cable industry is known for two things in consumers' minds: ever-increasing rates and ever-decreasing customer service,\" said rich bond, co-director of the opennet coalition, an aggregation of national and local isps. \"why would we put these guys in charge of the internet?\"phone companies have always been required by the fcc to let rival isps use their network, an \"open access\" policy -- that's how customers can order internet access from the phone company itself or any other isp that delivers in an area.cable companies have a different deal, at least for now. cable franchises are regulated by municipal governments instead of the federal government. that means operators can offer their own isp services or partner with preferred isps like road runner, which uses mediaone and time warner networks to provide subscription broadband services.opponents say cable companies can theoretically set prices as high as the market will bear. but that's not their greatest fear. they say cable companies are looking to set up exclusive partnerships that view customers as \"eyeballs.\"\"let's be clear about this: if cable companies open up their networks to other isps they'll be making money, not losing it,\" said andrew jay schwartzman, president of the media access project, a nonprofit law firm that represents civil rights, civil liberties, and consumer/environmental organizations on telecommunications issues.\"isps are willing, right now, to pay cable companies for that access at the same rates a consumer would. what the cable companies are trying to control is the content,\" he said.\"if cable companies let isps use their network they'll bring literally billions of dollars in,\" said bond, of the opennet coalition.\"all they have to do is build the network and let the isps market it. the dirty little secret is they want the content. if you type in 'books' in their search engine, partner amazon.com will come up. type in 'toys' and you'll get etoys,\" bond said. \"cable companies are not interested in selling internet access. they're interested in selling the attention of their customers to the highest corporate bidder.\"early hopes that the fcc would mandate broadband cable regulations have come to little. the fcc has publicly stated it's taking a \"wait-and-see\" approach to regulating the emerging broadband market.\"i'd feel better about waiting for the fcc to move if i didn't know what wusses they are,\" said ken mceldowney, executive director of consumer action. \"look at the phone companies. the fcc allowed them to screw consumers for years and years with private unregulated pay phones, 900 numbers, slamming, cramming ... in all these areas the fcc has taken basically no action for 15 years.\"cable company opponents, meanwhile, are looking to city administrations to regulate cable operators as part of local cable franchise agreements. broward county, florida, has already adopted an open access policy. a federal appeals court is reviewing a portland, oregon, decision ordering at&t/tci to provide broadband network access to its net rivals.what policies will emerge remain to be seen. but one thing seems certain: with big companies entering the arena, the battle over millions of wired consumers only stands to get hotter."}
