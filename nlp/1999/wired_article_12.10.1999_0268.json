the letter, he said, was a public acknowledgment that his potential riches are due to the efforts of a widespread programming community.\"fairness to the hackers who made me bankable demands that i publicly acknowledge this result,\" raymond wrote, \"and publicly face the question of how it's going to affect my life and what i'll do with the money.\"raymond says the money initially won't have much effect on his life. \"i'm already living pretty much exactly the way i want to,\" he wrote. he then proceeded to list all the things he wants to spend his newfound wealth on: a cell phone, cable internet access, and of course, a new gun.\"but really, i don't want or need a lot of stuff,\" raymond wrote. \"i'm kind of buddhist that way.\"raymond followed this statement with a very un-buddhist pledge not to cooperate with charities asking for any of his money -- \"i am not going to be a soft touch, and will rudely refuse all importunities,\" raymond wrote. \"anyone who bugs me for a handout, no matter how noble the cause and how much i agree with it, will go on my permanent shit list.\"however, raymond listed a few worthy causes he would consider giving money to: hacker projects, free-speech activism, firearms rights and free tibet charities -- maybe.he muses that he may buy \"a hunk of rainforest for conservation.\"\"megabucks are power, and with power comes an obligation to use it wisely,\" he wrote.\"i'll still carry my own luggage,\" he wrote. \"and i'll never get too proud to crash on somebody's daybed when the local user group is too broke to cover a hotel.\"va linux's stock rocketed 700 percent on thursday, and closed at us$250 a share, giving the company a market capitalization of about $10 billion, or more than the gross domestic product (gdp) of jamaica.raymond was granted 150,000 share options at a strike price of less than four cents apiece, according to sec filings, for a value of about $32 million as of midday friday.but raymond will not be able to cash in any shares for at least six months, thanks to sec rules, and his public disclosure may have put his shares in jeopardy, according to one source close to the company.as a non-employee director, raymond's shares vest over a four-year period, dependent on him remaining on the board. raymond's status comes up for review at the annual meeting of stockholders in 2001, according to sec papers.\"they're pissed,\" said the source, who asked to remain anonymous.raymond has made waves before with comments that have landed on the web, including an email exchangewith open-source fellow bruce perens calling the police over threats made by raymond.raymond's paper riches pale in comparison to larry augustin's, the va linux 37-year-old ceo. augustin has 6.5 million shares and options to buy another 1.15 million at a strike price of two cents a share, making him worth about $1.9 billion.postings on open source-friendly hacker site slashdot were generally congratulatory towards raymond on his good fortune.\"it is nice to see a few linux gurus actually making some serious money,\" wrote one contributor, \"and i can think of few people who deserve it more than eric.\"va linux also distributed 352,000 shares to employees, friends, family, and members of the programming community. however, spokeswoman eureka endo declined to comment on the ipo, citing the sec-mandated quiet period.meanwhile, rob \"commander taco\" malda and jeff \"hemos\" bates of slashdot said the potential riches from parent company andover.net's ipo on thursday won't change their lives at all.like raymond, both malda and bates are set to make multi-million dollar fortunes. both said they will continue to run slashdot, and had no plans to cash out and retire to an island paradise.\"it's not money, it's paper,\" said malda. \"it might be able to be converted into money ... but it's not going to have much of an impact on how we operate.\"\"it's an alternate reality,\" added bates. \"i'm pleased, but the thing that pleases me the most is ... doing the job i love to do ... i wouldn't trade it for anything else in the world.\""}
