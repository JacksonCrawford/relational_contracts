stake in lycos to create a portal that combines bits of home shopping network with search services. by jennifer sullivan and craig bicknell.", "author": "craig bicknell", "category": "business",

shopping network, ticketing from ticketmaster online, and search-engine services. the acquisition would embed barry diller -- chairman of usa networks and creator of the fox network -- even deeper into the internet. in the past year, diller has invested in companies that emphasize online commerce. as part of the agreement, ticketmaster online-citysearch, an affiliate company controlled by diller, will be merged into lycos.under terms of the complex agreement, usa networks would own 61.5 percent of the new combined entity, lycos shareholders would own 30 percent, and shareholders of ticketmaster online-citysearch would own 8.5 percent. executives said the amount lycos shareholders receive would be determined by the market value of the combined companies.the new company will be called usa/lycos interactive networks. lycos ceo robert davis will become president and ceo of the new company, and will join its board of directors.with the acquisition, usa networks and the home shopping network could, in theory, tap a huge new audience of potential shoppers. in return, lycos would get exposure on television, a critical advantage over rivals like yahoo.\"we end up with the framework to create a global e-commerce entity,\" said davis. \"overnight, we become a us$1.5 billion business. we defy the internet law in that we're a business making substantial money from day one.\"still, some analysts said usa networks got a good deal at lycos shareholders' expense. when markets closed monday, lycos and ticketmaster online had a combined market value 1.5 times higher than usa networks. yet after the merger, lycos will own just 30 percent of the new company, and ticketmaster online 8.5 percent. by late afternoon, lycos (lcos) plunged $35.88, nearly 30 percent, to $91.38, while usa networks (usai) rose $4.38, or 12 percent, to $42.31. ticketmaster online dropped $15, or 26 percent, to $42.75.the agreement follows billion-dollar acquisitions in which companies like america online, at home, and yahoo paid handsome premiums to buy smaller rivals. at home, for example, paid nearly double excite's market value to buy internet search engine.\"the excite-at home deal really stepped up the pressure and speculation about lycos making a deal,\" said dan king, financial analyst at lasalle st. securities. \"when the [lycos] deal occurred, the value given to lycos was not at a premium.\"\"nobody likes this deal,\" added a fund manager who owns stock in lycos. \"and it's taking the whole market down, because everyone's afraid there will be more deals like it.\"the market fears extend beyond the low premium on lycos stock. the theoretical magic of an internet company is that it has low fixed costs. the ideal is to set up a web site, run by a few employees, that can grow to handle huge audiences, and millions of transactions, without having to add more people and resources.with 2,500 new home shopping network telemarketers alone expected to join the new usa/lycos, some disgruntled investors felt that lycos's theoretical net magic just evaporated.\"they really diluted the pure internet play,\" said a fund manager. \"their fixed costs go way up, and it becomes a much lower-margin business.\"lycos executives and diller defended the terms of the acquisition. \"the markets will react correctly over a period of time,\" said diller. \"we're not in this just for the next 20 minutes.\"davis further insisted that lycos shareholders will receive a big premium on their shares in the end. \"lycos [stock] is trading at a value 30 times our calendar 1998 revenue. if that multiple, that existed yesterday morning, exists when this deal is done, lycos shareholders will get a 100 percent premium.\"in other words, davis said the new company should still be viewed as an internet company and have the same outsized stock prices associated with them. the market didn't buy that logic, choosing instead to view the new company as a infrastructure-heavy media company.davis said lycos will keep its brand and will integrate online commerce \"where it makes sense.\" lycos itself is in the process of buying the parent company of wired news.in the past few weeks, lycos shares skyrocketed on speculation that a big media company would take a substantial stake in it, or buy it outright. davis confirmed that lycos had talked with \"everybody,\" including general electric's nbc television network unit and microsoft.lycos didn't go with an nbc deal because all it would have gotten from the deal was advertising. \"when it was said and done, that's all a traditional media company brought to the table,\" he said. \"but with this, we get significant e-commerce business, too. at the end of the year, we can buy more promotion on a broadcast network than any competitor.\""}
