the company's stock eased $1.94 to $141.06.cmp media (cmpx) jumped 13 percent to $38.44 on word that the publisher of information week and other magazines is being acquired by britain's united news & media for $920 million. united news said it will merge cmp's print and online assets with its miller freeman subsidiary, and will sell shares in an internet unit by the end of the year. united news (unewy) was up $1.50 at $23.75.elsewhere in the media world, usa networks (usai) shed $2.06 to $39.25 even as it posted a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss of 2 cents a share -- a fine showing considering that a setback of 16 cents had been anticipated. the company credited its improved performance on higher ad revenue from its cable properties. should be interesting to see how usa's bottom line looks once it expands its online holdings, including the still-pending purchase of lycos (with its still-pending acquisition of wired news).in tech, chipmaker actel (actl) plunged 30 percent to $13.31 after coming up a penny shy of estimates with first-quarter profit of 19 cents a share. kaufman brothers downgraded the company's shares to \"hold\" from \"buy.\" logitech international (logiy), meantime, advanced 63 cents to $14.75 as the leading maker of computer mouses saw its quarterly income surge sevenfold to $2.08 a share.another bummer of a day for some of the sector's top names. dell computer (dell) fell 56 cents to $41.06, and intel (intc) was 38 cents lower at $60.81. microsoft (msft) slid 6 cents to $82.06, and cisco systems (csco) was down $2.56 at $109.19.mci worldcom (wcom) declined $3.69 to $84 even as it announced that quarterly earnings almost quadrupled to 36 cents a share. ceo bernard ebbers said the company will tighten its focus on high-growth areas like voice and data services. but traders were peeved that he had nothing to say about mci's rumored buyout of wireless carrier nextel communications, and took out their frustration on the company's stock.lastly, anheuser-busch (bud) went flat despite topping estimates with first-quarter profit of 66 cents a share. the maker of budweiser saw its stock drop $2.81 to $72.56 as investors figured that the company probably won't see another quarter with 20 percent earnings growth, so maybe it's time to kick back and call it a day.in other words, miller time."}
