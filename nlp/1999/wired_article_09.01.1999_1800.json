including successful outfits like autosystems corporation, which produced a useful scheduling system for unix networks and was sold in 1995 for more than $14 million. and client/server connection inc., which sells popular project-management tools.the money supported a lavish lifestyle of multiple residences, jets, designer drugs, and sexual adventures with female followers. but lenz told lacey he was sure his flock was now out to kill him. all that on top of his health problems: lenz had been depressed for weeks after undergoing surgery to correct an impairment in his right eye.so lenz, wearing versace finery, a $30,000 watch, and his favorite dog's collar around his neck, pitched forward into the dark water and began to float away into a cozy inlet called conscience bay. no matter what awaited him in the \"off world,\" he was never coming back to this one.even in death, though, lenz remains a presence. one and a half years after his suicide, a fight is under way over both his physical estate and his spiritual legacy. the unlikely combatants include his attorney and accountant, the national audubon society, a mystery widow from austin, texas (a former flight attendant who showed up well after his death, clutching a marriage certificate from 1980), and a colorado springs, colorado, woman who claims she married lenz on a cruise ship more than 10 years ago and lived with him off and on until his death. also in the mix are various wannabe gurus competing for the hearts and minds of his followers.at stake is not only the value of lenz's $18 million estate but also the profits flowing from the still-existing companies he controlled, as well as the loyalties of many software developers who continue to believe in what he taught. precise figures are impossible to obtain, but the best estimate is that around 350 people still follow the lenz path to enlightenment, the majority of them residing in new york state and southern california. as before, many are secretive about it all. even now, few lenzies will talk about their experience.lenz's death and the tawdry details of his life apparently haven't dampened their enthusiasm much. lenzies continue to study his teachings on web sites like www.ramalila.com and www.electronictribe.com, meet in meditation groups, and shun outsiders. in a two-week period earlier this year, they raised well over $50,000 online for a new york subway-ad campaign to promote lenz's novels surfing the himalayas and snowboarding to nirvana.believers still gather for rave parties, like a summer-solstice celebration held in june at studio ze gallery in soho. for the people assembled at that event, lenz seemed to be just as meaningful dead as alive.\"i want to eventually be like rama,\" declared roger cantu, a 36-year-old database analyst and lenz follower who teaches meditation in arlington, texas. \"that's my goal.\"the only child of a divorced couple, lenz was a gangly, pimply-faced teenager who showed an early interest in eastern mysticism and entrepreneurship. the 1967 yearbook of rippowam high school in stamford, connecticut, says he displayed \"a streak of the unusual - chasing the beautiful, hiding from the known.\"after high school, lenz joined the tide of young people washing into haight-ashbury. he got busted for selling marijuana, and during a short stint in a california work camp he was exposed to literature about sri chinmoy, the new york-based guru who pushes an eclectic blend of hinduism, meditation, and obsessive physical conditioning. lenz became a chinmoy follower after moving back east to get on with his life. he studied at the university of connecticut, got married and divorced, and earned a phd in english literature at the state university of new york, stony brook.in 1979, chinmoy sent lenz to san diego to open a laundromat. not content to be a mere follower, he later launched his own group, which he incorporated in 1981 as lakshmi. he moved to malibu and soon styled himself as rama - a name denoting the last earthly incarnation of a hindu deity. according to mark laxer, a lapsed follower who lived with lenz at the time, lenz taught his own version of buddhist practices - as opposed to chinmoy's hindu tradition - and added \"money-making elements\" to his spiritual mix. lenz asked students for $4 a month, then $7; within a decade the monthly tuition fees would reach into the thousands.lenz's small band of believers searched for recruits on college campuses throughout the nation. one campaign involved 100 disciples distributing 4,000 posters and 100,000 promotional newsletters in california alone. newcomers were invited to meditation sessions where, in an upper-octave monotone, lenz promised to take them into the \"light.\"lenz didn't accept just anyone. he was interested only in bright, diligent, presentable followers, so he required people to fill out lengthy applications - with photos attached. (typical question: \"do you hear voices, or do you communicate with nonphysical beings?\") those who made the cut were taught what lenz called american buddhism, which included \"what matters: making money.\"lenz had the foresight to recognize that computer programming for mainstream institutions, including wall street banks, held far more potential than, say, street-corner flower sales. he urged his flock to learn the basics of programming at computer learning centers. lenz said computer training was integral to practicing buddhism; he insisted that writing code is like doing yoga, that it \"puts you in a very high place.\"\"it was quite a radical thing to take people who were used to eating granola and send them down to wall street,\" recalls william arntz, who was a lenz student for 12 years, until 1994. \"he said it was a warrior's task to go down there. he said the good thing about programming was that you can see how clear you are by how good your code works.\"\"in a lot of ways,\" says a current follower who, like several others, declined to be identified, \"your computer career became a vehicle for studying buddhism.\"lenz was certainly right about one thing: the shortage of skilled programmers in the early '80s. coders like arntz who were proficient in sql or fortran made $50 an hour, a rate that more than doubled by decade's end. from their earnings, followers would eventually pay lenz a monthly tuition ranging from $125 for college students to $5,000 for the highest earners. some would fork over as much as $1,000 to have dinner with the man who clued them in on everything from what to wear (armani evoked authority, he said, while calvin klein was for wimps) to where to live (he endorsed certain \"power\" centers, like westchester county in suburban new york).__ some disgruntled members charged lenz with being a drug-ingesting charlatan. __invoking a theme from carlos castaneda, lenz told followers that their paths would be smoother if they made themselves \"inaccessible\" to outsiders who might drain their energy. that meant creating an elaborate shield to conceal their physical whereabouts: relying on post-office boxes, hiding behind email. buying into the lenz trip often meant moving every six months or so - whenever he requested it - and acquiring no more material goods than you could stuff in a car. it appeared that he mistrusted not only outsiders but his own students as well.\"this was a man who made you sign an eight-page form if you went out with him on a date,\" says a lapsed follower now living in the new york area. lenz warned students that the backlash for leaving the group included personal tragedies like cancer and fatal car crashes.and many smart people - smart grasping-at-spiritual-straws people - bought it. typical lenzies were (and are) educated, intelligent, ambitious. lenz helped them fill a spiritual void while advancing their careers. so what if he sometimes berated them or peremptorily kicked them out - particularly when they couldn't afford the monthly tuition?\"it was almost like being a junkie,\" recalls a businessman who grudgingly admits that his own addiction to lenz lasted 14 years. \"you got hooked on him.\"word of lenz's ways started leaking out in 1987, when he was living on and off in a house in stony brook - not far from the site of his eventual suicide. a few disgruntled members, like mark laxer, a former money collector for his operation, were taking their tales of life with rama to the press, charging the so-called yuppie guru with being a drug-ingesting charlatan. a group of parents formed lenz-watch, and former female members reported stories of sexual coercion.lenz would lay low after each round of bad press, but he didn't abandon his lavish lifestyle. with hundreds of thousands of dollars a month flowing in by the early '90s, he flew in a jet between homes he occupied in the exclusive communities of old field, new york, and tesuque, new mexico. he organized elaborate dinners for his followers and \"power trips\" to the california desert, europe, and the caribbean. he led regular meditation sessions in hotel meeting rooms, backed by the music of zazen, the group's favored band. keyboardist steve kaplan, now a lapsed believer, doubled as a cash courier. \"i would fly to new york and come back and deliver the money to marcus,\" he says. \"like $400,000 in checks and money orders.\"kaplan is referring to norman marcus, who was - and still is, along with norman oberstein - the older, clearheaded power behind the lenz enterprise. (both declined to be interviewed for this article.) marcus was a los angeles-based ernst & young partner when he became lenz's accountant in 1993. four years later he retired from the big five firm to work full-time for lenz, taking charge of the group's financial operations, which had become increasingly complex as lenz's wealth expanded.oberstein, a los angeles attorney, generated many of the numerous contracts lenz supporters were asked to sign. followers didn't object to contracts that restricted them from talking about the lenz group, and they could afford to keep up with the fees because they were gaining ground in the world of computer programming. they were landing contracting gigs in the information-technology units of wall street companies like salomon brothers.the lenzies often did respectable work, but not always. \"i was one of the first people to give computer training, and i had only one year of data processing,\" recalls former member mark lurtsema. \"let's put it this way: those courses were not college level.\" in the consultants' and contractors' newsletter, whose readership includes managers who hire computer programmers in and around new york city, editor wendy vandame frequently reported on the impact of unseasoned lenz followers at places like nynex and deutsche bank. she estimates that, from about 1987 to 1994, lenz's people caused millions of dollars in business losses in the new york metropolitan area, the result of missed project deadlines and spending on services that were inadequate or misrepresented. still, the lenzies proliferated, in part because their technical training was backed with seminars about aggressive job hunting. one training document goes so far as to suggest, \"have a friend using a pseudonym act as your reference person.\"lenz's growing fame continued to attract scrutiny and controversy. in 1994, wired published \"the code cult of the cpu guru,\" which reported on the suicide note left by 23-year-old ucla student donald cole (\"bye rama, see you next time\") and the morphine-overdose death of 40-year-old jack kukulan, who had recently given lenz roughly $100,000.the article drew a $40 million libel suit, and though it was later dropped, a feeling persists among lenz's fans that he was always treated unfairly in the mainstream media. \"i've had two teachers, and both of them have been crucified,\" says tony chester, a former minister with the church of religious science - an entity not affiliated with lenz - and a teacher who now caters to onetime rama students.\"one of them was crucified on a cross,\" he adds, \"and the other was crucified in the press.\"as lenz got richer, he dished out cash to turn himself into a high-profile celebrity. in 1995 he bought billboard space and full-page ads in rolling stone and the new york times to promote surfing the himalayas, a fictionalized account of his \"internal and external\" experiences in nepal. lenz spent close to $1.5 million to promote his book and its sequel, snowboarding to nirvana.__ lenz encouraged recruits to start software companies, and more than 100 of them did. __lenz also enjoyed a host of new business opportunities. he encouraged followers to launch software businesses, and more than 100 of them did. \"to start a company became the major focus of things,\" recalls arntz.a handful of these companies became prominent in their fields. under the direction of arntz, autosystems, based in boulder, colorado, created autosys scheduling software, which became something of a unix-industry standard. teamalliance, cofounded by lenz follower richard harmon and a colleague, mordy levine, was a high tech industry-recruitment operation that grew to include 30 regional offices by 1995. while such lenz-inspired companies as retail forecasting systems and sportscaster ended up in the ether, some of the products invented by lenz's disciples in his name were quite good. unisys, for instance, relies on a client/server connection networking tool - whose patent lists lenz as an inventor - to develop architectural road maps for its customers.what many of these enterprises had in common, of course, was that the founders had agreed to turn over as much as 50 percent of gross revenues to privately held companies owned by lenz. a typical lenz software operation might consist of two separate entities: a \"ltd.\" company owned by the entrepreneur and an \"inc.\" affiliate owned by lenz, which in some cases retained the intellectual property.the entities were set up to keep lenz awash in money. an entrepreneur whose business software is widely used - and who declines to be identified - gave lenz 49.9 percent of his company in exchange for a nominal investment. he also passed along 50 percent of his revenues to a lenz-owned consulting company he claims provided no services. teamalliance cofounders levine and harmon had to pass along 50 percent of their net to lenz, who provided some investment capital and agreed to sign a bank letter of credit for hundreds of thousands of dollars.\"he didn't own half of my company,\" says arntz, but lenz did ask him to turn over up to 50 percent of his revenues. in a few instances lenz provided seed capital. that was the case with client/server connection and with vayu web, a web-building-tool company named after lenz's favorite scottish terrier.lenz also placed his students in unpaid or minimum-wage internships. a programmer who is still involved in the group recalls moonlighting as a poorly paid intern for a lenz company, even though he was able to command high rates in the open market.\"rama had the whole student body selling or in some way participating in the organization,\" he says. although he was earning more than $60 an hour at a non-lenz company, he was recruited to work for a nominal wage.students sometimes signed agreements that denied them rights to intellectual property they developed. the understanding was that rama was giving them the energy to be successful. even after his death, the dividends of that policy are rolling in: on september 29, 1998, the us patent and trademark office issued a patent for a project estimator involving a rule-based expert system, listing lenz as one of the two inventors.and lenz was hardly a passive, name-only investor. for smart, motivated entrepreneurs, he was a pest. if a founder fell out of favor with the guru, lenz would simply pull resources, including the cheap student labor he otherwise provided. \"for lenz it was like, 'if icrash and burn the company because i don't like it, istill get 50 percent of the software used by other companies,'\" says a former student whose company is partly owned by the lenz estate.for the most part, too, the ownership arrangements ensured that when the companies were sold, rama reaped the rewards. in 1996, when teamalliance was sold for roughly $9 million to hall kinion, a cupertino, california-based recruiter, cofounders levine and harmon made good on a contract to give about half to lenz - in cash. autosystems founder arntz says he gave rama one-third of the more than $14 million he received from selling his company - not because of any contractual obligation but because they had a handshake agreement.as word of the group made its way into the business community, a link to lenz could cause negative reverberations. bill slater, a nonfollower, observed that lenz \"had taught them very meticulously to deny him.\" but the lenz outfits also staved off potential challenges by slavishly promoting one another. \"it was like a damn pyramid scheme, the way he got people to cover for each other and pump each other's companies,\" recalls slater.in december 1996, vayu web announced its web-building tool, vayu web 500, at internet world in new york. lenz's prolific pr woman, lisa lewinson, sent out a torrent of press releases that saturated the wires, proclaiming \"vayu web 500 launch stuns net community.\" and much of the praise came from other lenz students. \"it's like the difference between giving someone the keys to a model t or a ferrari,\" gushed vantage point president lawrence borok in a vayu web press release. lenz follower marc myers, columnist for network world, went further: \"they've reinvented the internet.\"by the mid-1990s, the guru was looking a little ragged. members of his flock were concerned about their leader's health; some had seen him drinking heavily. vayu web's product was going nowhere. barnes & noble - tipped off by a lenz watcher - canceled its inclusion of lenz in a barnesandnoble.com promotion whose participants could win trips to literary destinations like dickens' london, steinbeck's california, and lenz's nepal. when 300 disciples attended what turned out to be a final mass lecture by lenz in westchester county in late 1997, rama looked skinny and ill.\"everybody could tell he was near the end,\" says one follower.one month before he died, lenz phoned brynn lacey. over dinner in manhattan, he produced travel brochures from high-end resorts around the world. they talked about a vacation of scuba diving, mountain climbing, or golfing. the couple cocooned in lenz's estate, carefully planning a tour of the south pacific.but just before their trip, lenz told lacey he didn't want to go. instead, he showed her the valium and phenobarbital he had for the trip to the \"off world.\" she agreed to go with him.lacey survived her valium overdose, and even tried to save lenz's life, diving into 49-degree water to fish him out. but she kept washing up against rocks as lenz's body floated away. exhausted from the struggle, she made her way up to the house and took upwards of 35 tabs of phenobarbital, washed down with appleton rum. following lenz's wishes, she put some of the drug into food for each of their two scottish terriers, who survived the dosage. bloody and bruised from the attempted rescue, she stumbled into a bedroom, knocking down furniture and breaking glass.__ since the suicide, lenzies have seemed to be trapped in a state of suspended animation. __\"i wanted to kill myself to join the doctor,\" she would later tell police from a hospital bed.lenz was found two days later, after old field constable robert bell discovered lacey semiconscious in a downstairs bedroom. bell phoned estate caretaker malcolm wade and the two began a search, but lacey blurted out something about \"the doctor\" being in the water. according to wade's subsequent statement to police, he first phoned not 911 but norman marcus, lenz's accountant, and norman oberstein, his attorney, both of whom live in california. they told wade and bell to call a doctor for the doped-up woman. police and an ambulance arrived, followed by a diving team that searched the bay. the divers retrieved the 6' 2\", 184-pound body of fred lenz, his dirty-blond curls matted down on his androgynous face. they also retrieved a bottle of absolut vodka, one black shoe, and a tiny statue of the buddha, which they found below the dock.it wasn't long before something else would surface: the will lenz had signed in california on october 25, 1994. norman marcus was named as executor.when he wrote out his will, lenz had made it clear he was unmarried and that he wanted to leave his estate neither to his father - whom he was helping support in san luis obispo, california - nor a half sister. he'd told gerald lunn, his estate attorney, that he wanted his $18 million estate used to establish a nonprofit trust \"to make buddhist teachings more generally available and/or for the defense of american buddhists who were being persecuted.\" but the will stipulated that in the event lenz hadn't gotten around to taking \"significant steps\" to establish such a foundation, all the money would go to the national audubon society.why audubon?\"lenz loved birds,\" recalls mark laxer. \"he told me that when he died he wanted the money to go there and to amnesty international.\"two and a half months after the suicide, marcus formed and registered the frederick p. lenz foundation for american buddhism, naming two officers, himself and oberstein, and placing lenz's father on the board. marcus stood to benefit greatly from rama's will. as executor of the estate (which includes $6.3 million in closely held companies and $5.9 million in t-bills), his compensation is at least 2 percent of its assets. he also assumes the role of president of at least two of lenz's companies (software visions and infinity plus consulting, according to an affidavit submitted by the national audubon society). because those organizations are privately held, he isn't required to report how much, if anything, he is earning as their new president.since his client's suicide, marcus has been hard at work keeping lenz's business infrastructure intact, according to one source at a software company partly owned by the lenz estate. the individual says marcus pressured the company to continue to pay a share of its revenues to lenz's company infinity plus consulting, even after rama's death. marcus also started receiving an annual salary of $60,000 as director of the frederick p. lenz foundation for american buddhism.but at a critical point along the way, marcus crossed paths with a group of bird-watchers who wanted to know whether lenz himself had done anything to establish the buddhism foundation. susan bloom, an attorney representing the audubon society, would later argue that for six months the foundation's attorneys had failed to produce the evidence she requested. so audubon started proceedings in court, prompting marcus to provide evidence that lenz had taken measures to start the foundation. among the items marcus submitted in january of this year: records indicating that he had researched trademarkable names for the foundation, letters of inquiry to lenz's alma maters about endowments, and an affidavit from lunn explaining that the guru was too distracted with his eye problems, too anxious and depressed, to work on the foundation.marcus' strategy was to get a summary judgment from judge albert j. emanuelli of the westchester county surrogate's court, thus avoiding a trial. for its part, audubon tried a tricky legal maneuver: in addition to asserting that lenz never directed his counselors to establish a foundation and that marcus and oberstein were acting in their own self-interest, it also submitted a collection of articles and testimony supporting the assertion that lenz was a fraud and that in his final years his interest in american buddhism had been waning.on may 6, emanuelli ruled against marcus, denying his request for a summary judgment. audubon and marcus then embarked on the lengthy discovery process that may eventually lead to a trial.meanwhile, other claimants entered the fray. a few weeks earlier, larchmont, new york, attorney rita gilbert took a telephone call from a woman in texas who claimed to be lenz's widow. \"she just called me. i assumed she was referred to me by someone,\" says gilbert. \"i asked her to give me proof of what she was telling me.\" until that moment, the attorney had never heard of fred lenz.what gilbert soon received was a california marriage certificate from 1980 indicating that lenz and diana jean reynolds had been married by a minister of the universal life church in san diego. one of the two witnesses was mark laxer. \"they may have been married, but i don't know,\" says laxer, who now writes software for the us customs agency. \"nor do i remember being witness to a marriage.\" (laxer was also named as a defendant in the libel suit against wired regarding its 1994 lenz story; the magazine paid for his defense.)\"she's a very private person,\" says gilbert of her client. \"this was hard for her to do.\" (reynolds declined to discuss the case.) before meeting the alleged wife in person, gilbert agreed to try to help her claim one-third of the lenz estate. she adds that reynolds is on disability, but won't indicate what for. gilbert also admits that reynolds, a former lenz student, may not have ever lived with the guru. \"they stopped seeing each other in the 1980s,\" reports the attorney. in take me for a ride, his book about his years in rama's inner circle, laxer refers to reynolds without naming her. she is described as an extremely attractive former dancer and flight attendant with long brown hair. no longer a member of the lenz group, according to gilbert, she now lives quietly and sees few people. of course, claiming her share of lenz's millions will likely mean drawing plenty of attention in a three-way contest in a white plains, new york, courtroom.on may 27 she encountered additional competition: another woman claiming to be married to rama - only this one shared his name. a woman calling herself deborah lenz had phoned white plains attorney anthony detommasi on the last possible day for applying to new york state for the one-third share she could be entitled to as a surviving spouse. she claimed to have had an 11-year marriage to rama, whom she asserted would visit her periodically in her colorado condominium. in 1989, during a time she claimed to be deprogramming lenz followers, she was quoted in an aspen daily news article (where she used the name deborah haines), describing lenz as dangerous and saying \"he'll do anything he can to stop me and shut me up.\"__ the market for lenz wannabes has opened up. but no one is getting rich. __like diana reynolds, deborah lenz will have to prove she was rama's spouse. the attorneys representing marcus hired a private investigator, who found that no marriage certificate was filed in san diego. reynolds' attorney claimed the certificate could have been legally filed elsewhere in california, and she promised to produce other evidence of the union at a future hearing.\"it appears he may have had relations with many women during the course of his life,\" says detommasi. \"to some of these women he may have extended promises of marriage. deborah lenz is contending that, in her case, the promise of marriage came to fruition.\"with lenz long gone, his followers seem to be trapped in a state of suspended animation. many of them are still inaccessible, still gathering privately in small groups, and slaving to keep lenz alive - in cyberspace. despite the splintering effect, every day still is greeted with new postings on www.ramalila.com - lengthy elegies, endless memories of moments with rama, screensavers, poems. there's even a collection of his favorite jokes.hundreds of former lenz followers are bereft of their spiritual leader, but fewer than a dozen have stepped forward to offer classes in meditation and career advancement. and it's clear that none of them has the charisma - not to mention salesmanship - to fill rama's shoes. fifty-two-year-old tony chester, based in los angeles, is one of eight teachers promoting themselves to lenz's students on www.ramalila.com. david ash, a lenz student with a phd in computer sciences from stanford, has led meditation sessions at new york's millennium broadway hotel. ash runs the rae-chorze fwaz mystery school (named for a school of enlightenment mentioned in surfing the himalayas) and plans to take students on skydiving adventures. roger cantu also holds classes, which he says are attended by former rama students, among others, in a conference room in the back of the half-price bookstore in arlington, texas. he plans to spread his influence by teaching regularly in houston, los angeles, and new york. \"it's interesting. david is in the east. tony's in the west. and i'm in the middle,\" he says, adding, \"i've got more students than tony.\"a few other former students have jumped into the fray. ken frazee, who has led meditation sessions in boise, maintains a page on www.ramalila.com that says he has studied with chester for the past seven years and that \"about four years ago, tony gave to ken an empowerment to teach.\" meanwhile, a stream of followers is now drifting off to other spiritual leaders. some have flocked to adi da (formerly franklin jones), the fiji-based guru who, like lenz, has faced accusations of sexual abuse by former followers. some have headed to india to sit at the feet of sathya sai baba, a guru known for sharing what money he collects with the people of his neighborhood.but a year and a half after the market for rama wannabes opened up, none of the candidates is getting rich. in california, tony chester, with all the trappings of a budding spiritual leader, appears to hold the center. he sells audiotapes and calls his business expanded awareness seminars. he imported a teacher from new york to run a career workshop. he hosts desert retreats. a former schoolteacher who became a minister with the church of religious science, chester came under rama's spell in 1981 and later took up computer programming. he was a formal student of rama's on and off until about 1994. but unlike lenz, chester downplays the influence he may exert on his pupils. \"any spiritual teacher worth his salt,\" he declaims, \"needs his students to have an open heart in order to make this work.\"a harley-davidson enthusiast, chester is becoming something of a fixture on the southern california meditation circuit. clinging to his framed photograph of the leather-jacketed lenz, chester keeps the rama business alive in a grueling meditation schedule that brings him before different groups of meditators throughout the week. one night he's at westwood's body mind institute, another at san diego's dharma center, located in a second-story room in the funky, surfer-trash ocean beach neighborhood.dharma center cofounder jenna walsh, another meditation teacher, has met with chester during some of his sessions in san diego. she says he \"does a great meditation.\" but she makes it sound like a spiritual consolation prize. \"rama was just such a full-rounded teacher,\" she explains. \"he had it all down. he could talk to us about business, about r\u00e9sum\u00e9 writing, about advanced meditative practice. i've gone and seen several tibetan lamas, and none of them could pull all of that off.\"\"with rama leaving the body,\" she says, \"it's forced us to look at each other and learn from each other instead of just relying on him for the answers.\"in a recent meditation session in los angeles, chester sounded a similar theme, acknowledging that he cannot carry the mantle alone.\"jesus couldn't cure a headache in nazareth,\" said the rama follower-cum-teacher. \"he had cured lepers, but when he got to nazareth their hearts were closed, so nothing could happen.\"on this night, chester was renting space for his meditation classes from the body mind institute in los angeles, a single, dimly lit room above a furniture store off santa monica boulevard. chester, a bald man with a perfect buddha body, sat on a chair in front of a dozen meditators - most of whom, like the leader himself, were former students of rama. the new age music of zazen, emanating from a cd player on a marble-topped asian table, set a mystical mood. to chester's left stood an altar containing a vase of flowers, a candle, and a framed photograph of lenz, with his golden curls and leather jacket.as the meditation continued, chester aimed his eyes at those of a brazilian high schooler in the group, one of the few non-lenzies, telling the young man to focus on the area of chester's pale green silk shirt where his chest meets his protruding stomach. then he slowly instructed the youngster to look at his face.soon chester started talking about how we don't need to concern ourselves with anger. \"don't be angry about what's happening in washington,\" he intoned. \"it will only drain your energy. emotions are draining. anger is draining. so is frustration. so is being a victim. so is love.\"at the end of the two-hour session, he hugged the framed picture of lenz, tears dripping down his
