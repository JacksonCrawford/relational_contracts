seeing progress in generating cells used to repair or even replace damaged organs. the country's leading experts in building bones, livers, and even genitalia gathered at the 85th annual american college of surgeons conference on tuesday to discuss the latest advances in the tissue engineering field.dr. anthony atala, director of the tissue engineering program and the urology department at the children's hospital in boston, showed slides of home-grown ureters, bladders, and genitalia.several labs are looking at ways to replace organs with the patients' own urologic tissue by taking small biopsies, and growing the cells in the laboratory before reintroducing them back to the body, atala said. the scientists use scaffolds as a mold to construct the organs, then hope to bring the cells back to the patient.atala said the most promising advance in urologic tissue engineering is in treatments for urinary incontinence and vesicoureteral reflux, a condition in which the urine backs up into the kidney and can cause kidney failure.atala is testing ways to take cells from the patient, grow them outside the body, then inject them back into the body to act as a \"bulking agent\" to block the leaky parts of the organ.\"it's a 10 minute procedure, saving the patients three to four hours of open surgery and a three to four day hospital stay,\" atala said.\"one of the major problems is if we need tissue from outside the urologic tract, we are forced to use tissues that don't belong there. there's not enough bladder tissue so we end up using intestine, which has significantly different properties from bladder tissue, atala said.using the urologic tissue is potentially better than using other tissues, because it's the \"same tissue from the same patient -- there's no rejection and no need for immunosuppressive drugs, and the tissue would hopefully function like the patient's own tissue would,\" atala said.advances are also being shown in growing bone and cartilage outside of the body, according to dr. joseph lane, a professor of orthopedic surgery at the weill medical college of the cornell hospital for special surgery.\"we're finding it's very easy to replace bone tissue -- it's harder in cartilage but we're making progress in that area also,\" lane said.recent advances in the field allow surgeons to take cells from bone marrow and grow them in large quantities outside the body. a matrix composed of collagen, ceramic, biodegradable polymers, or proteins, forms a frame for the cells.researchers have also come up with a way to inject cells as a liquid into damaged bone, and by controlling the temperature, enhance the bone cells' ability to grow, lane said.\"right now in animals we can regenerate bone with its blood supply,\" lane said. \"we're learning that the more primitive the bone, the better it works. it lets the body make the template.\"lane said experiments in mexico and europe have shown success in inducing fusion of damaged bone by injecting dna into the spine.one researcher in mexico, according to lane, has seen success in all of his patients participating in a randomized controlled phase i and ii trial on spine fusion. the experiments should be completed within two years.\"once we see the first applications, i suspect there will be off-label [not approved] use,\" such as for other types of fractures, lane said.also in development is a bioartificial liver process which uses pig liver cells to cleanse the blood.six patients who were initially considered acute cases needing immediate transplants were given bioartificial livers and recovered so well that they were declared too healthy to stay on the transplant list, according to dr. achilles demetriou.demetriou, chairman of the department of surgery at the cedars-sinai medical center in los angeles, has been working on building a bioartificial liver for almost 25 years.\"the liver is unique in its complexity,\" demetriou said. \"think of it as the power station of the body. like the power station of a city, when it goes out, the lights go out.\"regardless of the success with the procedure, demetriou doesn't see the pig cell bioartificial liver as a potential cure. rather, he said it buys patients time.\"the idea is to treat them early and treat them repeatedly to get them back to the baseline so we can buy some time for a permanent replacement down the road,\" demetriou said.\"with a human cell line, however, we could possibly do it,\" demetriou said.demetriou pointed out that although there is currently a ban on federal research using human embryonic stem cells, president clinton recently initiated talks on using the controversial cells in experiments.\"as soon as i get my hands on those cells we'll use them, but as of now we don't have any, so we're using pig liver cells,\" demetriou said.still further on the horizon is the potential to get cells from the central nervous system to regenerate.dr. steven pincus, assistant professor at the george washington university children's national medical center in washington, dc, is researching ways to use neuronal stem cells to stimulate repairing the central nervous system.the adult mammalian brain can't repair itself, so pincus has been experimenting with using stem cells.although the research is still in its infancy, a group at the university of pittsburgh has already begun experiments in humans with positive results thus far, pincus said.pincus said that in countries where use of fetal tissue is allowed, researchers have been \"moderately successful in the clinical engraftment of fetal tissue into the adult parkinsonian brain, suggesting that cell replacement could be a potential treatment.\""}
