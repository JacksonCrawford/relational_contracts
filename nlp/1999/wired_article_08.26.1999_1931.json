that's a very important finding in terms of compliance,\" andersen said.those women who received counseling but didn't comply with chemotherapy were about 10 times less likely to say it was because of nausea or vomiting.\"deep breathing and relaxation techniques are not part of the standard regimen -- this research suggests that it should be part of your standard treatment,\" stein said.if patients can have a higher tolerance for treatment, they're more likely to take the full treatment, or even more aggressive treatment, he said.\"when patients are diagnosed, they should be assigned to a group or social worker, someone in the mental health field.\"in addition to having less damaging hormones and helpful antibodies, the counseled patients were also less depressed, had more energy, and said they were getting more social support from friends.anderson believes that the reduction of emotional stress and distress in cancer patients is directly linked to a lower amount of stress hormones, a stronger immune response, and a better overall quality of life.joseph dye, a behavioral scientist with the behavioral research center at the acs, agrees.\"it's nice to see that the mind-body connection is legitimate and it's something that's important for the med community to understand,\" dye said.\"if they're treated as a whole, patients will respond better. this is some evidence in favor of that.\""}
