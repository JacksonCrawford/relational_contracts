leading authority on adult education predicts the classroom of the future will exist online. a wired news q&a by lakshmi chaudhry.", "author": "lakshmi chaudhry", "category": "culture", "type":

network (lern), the world's largest lifelong learning organization. his forthcoming book, teaching online, predicts that half of all education will occur online in the 21st century and that people will learn better and faster in virtual classrooms with hundreds of students around the world.wired news goes back to school- - - - - -in draves' world, education will be wholly oriented toward the individual. students will learn at their own pace and on their own time. there will be no such thing as being late for class. gigantic course offerings will allow residents of nome to study anything from molecular biology to the art of origami.what's more, people will learn all their lives, draves says. keeping up in the information age will mean investing at least one hour learning every day to keep up. it's a small price, he argues, for gaining the greater democracy and diversity of a global classroom.if the current rush to set up cyber-universities is any indication, draves' future may be just around the corner. wired news recently spoke to draves about his vision and the future of education.wn: in what sense will online learning transform in-person learning?draves: instead of the teacher delivering content, the sage on the stage will become the guide on the side. the person will spend more time with you as a learner than with the subject matter. the in-person teacher may not even be the best subject-matter expert, but he or she is going to know how to lead a discussion. he or she is going to know how to create a positive learning atmosphere. and all of those things are going to happen in person.it's really a marketplace in its orientation toward the learner. the vast majority of students may only have access to some authorities and experts online. they may simply not be able to afford to be in a class with them in person. the choice is, \"do i want to hear this person online or do i not want to hear them at all?\"wn: you keep talking about a teacher as someone who stands in front of a blackboard and drones. in fact, good teachers don't just deliver information. isn't there more going on in the classroom?draves: basically you don't have time in person to have as much discussion and interaction [as on the internet]. yes, there is interaction going on in classrooms but it's less than 10 percent of what goes in a classroom. even with a great instructor, 90 percent has to be information transfer because before the internet was invented, there wasn't any way even for great teachers to get the information out.wn: can every subject be taught online?draves: no. there will be a whole variety of formats. some things will be totally online. some things you can't teach at all online. some will be a mixture of online and in person.wn: what are examples of what will work better online and what will work better in person?draves: on the off-line thing, i would say ethics, moral issues, attitudes. i don't need to know a whole lot of information on an ethical issue. at the other extreme, the new tax law. it doesn't matter how you or i feel about the new tax law. i just need to know what the new tax law is. that is an example of information the internet will deliver much faster, much better.wn: you claim our goals in learning will become results-oriented, rather than process-oriented. is this true of all courses, or are you thinking specifically about adult learning and professional development?draves: not all courses. the learning marketplace out there is expanding. someone who takes a course in romantic literature because they're going to italy might not want to be tested. if my employer needs me to know java, i need to take a test to prove to my employer that i know it.wn: part of the liberal arts ideal of a college education is not just to prepare you for the workplace, but to also broaden your intellectual horizons. will the college experience become more results-oriented, too?draves: the internet will make that liberal arts ideal even broader. certainly at a university you and i have a wide variety of courses to choose from. but a whole lot of people are in community colleges. if you look at the course curriculum, it's not quite that broad. but with the internet and online courses, the community college can offer 100,000 different courses to its students. one of the things that's going to happen is a broadening of choices and enrichment of learning at all levels.wn: one of the biggest criticisms of existing institutions is that classes are getting bigger, and more impersonal, with professors relying on standardized tests. you're saying that these characteristics will make online learning more personal. isn't that contradictory?__draves:__it's going to be more personalized because you as an individual learner will get more feedback on what you know and how you're proceeding and you'll have your curriculum tailored toward your learning needs. that's simply not possible with in-person learning.there will still be in-person courses available, but the cost of education is going to have to come down because there is an information society and more people will have to be involved at a college level, whether it's taking place at the workplace or at the university. more people are going to have to have more opportunities to learn than is currently available under this very high tuition cost structure, which is really not functioning. it's leaving out so many people.wn: according to your predictions, competition between universities will push down the cost of education as institutions try to out-price each other. but are you saying that universities will become for-profit businesses?draves: universities have to be businesses in the information age. they have to be cost-effective. they have to bring their prices down. unlike businesses, universities have to serve 100 percent of the people. business goes after the most profitable 20 percent. education will not succeed if it goes after the 20 percent of students with the most money. unlike business, education needs to continue to be nonprofit and oriented toward the majority of citizens.online learning will go down in price and will be available to lots of people. in-person education is still going to be expensive. it's expensive now. there's no way to see that it would come down in price.wn: one widespread criticism is that universities are jumping on the online learning bandwagon to make money. will ivy league schools offer an online version of their degrees to make money, and more prestigious -- and expensive -- in-person degrees?__draves:__that could happen, we don't know. but what if someone took the online course and scored higher on the pre-law exams than students on the harvard campus?even if you go to harvard, you're going to have some learning online. if i'm offering this to the world, how do i maintain my exclusivity? it's a question that universities have to face. it will be interesting to see whether exclusivity will have an impact on reputation. how does a university maintain its cutting edge as the foremost authority when it has only 25 people in its class while another university has 100 students and delivers more information? universities may not be able to be foremost authorities and remain exclusive."}
