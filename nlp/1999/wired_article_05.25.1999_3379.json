threaten legislation to relax crypto export regulations, the bane of the us software industry for years. declan mccullagh reports from washington.", "author": "declan mccullagh", "category":

encryption rules in the near future, a top white house official predicted tuesday. the conclusions of the 872-page report will probably result in legislators tightening export controls instead of relaxing them, white house chief of staff john podesta said.the report, which said china has been stealing us nuclear weapon designs since the 1970s, was published tuesday morning by a congressional committee chaired by representative christopher cox (r-california). it claimed current design information about weapons such as the w-88 nuclear warhead used in the trident nuclear submarines were acquired from research labs including lawrence livermore, los alamos, and oak ridge.as a result, the report said, chinese mobile missile systems \"may be tested in 1999, and could be deployed as soon as 2002.\" chinese government officials have strenously denied the charges.\"it's important to recognize that the context of this report and congressman cox's comments this morning ... will be a significant issue,\" podesta told tech lobbyists at a caucus sponsored by the computer and communications industry association.the white house and the fbi oppose significant changes in rules prohibiting firms from freely exporting secure encryption products, which can be used to shield individual privacy from eavesdroppers or corporate secrets from competitors.corporations and privacy advocates have argued for years that clinton's executive order places us firms at a competitive disadvantage. a handful of bills in congress would relax that rule. the house commerce committee heard testimony tuesday morning on the merits of one measure, the security and freedom through encryption act.podesta said the white house was \"trying to balance national security concerns with whether we can practically and effectively control those technologies.\"his conclusion: encryption controls are still necessary.industry lobbyists said that the report wouldn't be as damaging as podesta claimed.\"what is threatening is that there are people who will misuse, distort, and try to take advantage of some of the real problems identified in the cox report and give conclusions that aren't justified,\" said ed black, president of the ccia.\"some of the hard-core export control people have never adjusted to the undeniable reality of technology availability,\" black said. \"this gives them a chance to raise the emotional fever pitch to a point where they hope it will cloud rational thinking.\"also speaking at the event was representative rick boucher, a virginia democrat. he said industry groups should support his legislation that covers privacy, digital signatures, and even forged headers on electronic mail.the practice of forging email by connecting to an open mail server -- a rite of passage for every computer science freshman and standard operating procedure for spammers -- should be punished with hard time in a federal penitentiary, boucher said.\"we would make it a criminal offense to falsify original information in email,\" boucher said.boucher said he also wanted to stop web sites from surreptitiously placing cookies -- small data files used by web sites to track visitors -- on consumers' hard drives. he said he had a bad experience after enabling cookies and having his browser repeatedly ask him for permission to accept them.\"it really intimidates me. i clicked that back on,\" said boucher, a member of the key commerce and judiciary committees.to shield consumers from confusion online and spur electronic commerce, boucher said the federal government should order all web sites to tell visitors what is done with personal information they submit. officials at the federal trade commission would enforce the law.\"all web sites would have to comply with that simple requirement,\" he said.but some lobbyists, who asked not to be identified, predicted boucher's proposal had virtually zero chance of making its way through the necessary committees.boucher also said that congress should scrutinize cable companies for their practice of bundling additional services with high-speed internet connectivity. if the idea catches on, internet provider start-ups could be put out of business, he said.\"this poses a major problem for the [isps].... these are start-up companies that didn't exist five years ago.\"in response to a question, he said that \"there is very little interest\" among legislators in revisiting antitrust law until the microsoft case is over."}
