act. at least 17 groups -- representing america online, microsoft, and newspaper and magazine publishers -- are scheduled to submit an amicus brief supporting the american civil liberties union's  challenge to the law, wired news has learned.the coalition will stress that average american businesses, and not just civil libertarians, are alarmed by the measure. the law requires web sites with commercial content to bar underage readers from any material that might be \"harmful to minors.\"the 35-page brief argues that the law is overly broad, that complying with the law is nearly impossible, and that filtering software and other technologies are more practical than a federal criminal law.\"we want to assist the court's understanding of the ongoing development and state of development of the software technology that would further the interests of a private-sector and market-driven solution, as opposed to the blunderbuss technique of government regulation,\" said bruce rich, a lawyer at weil, gotshal, & manges who is writing the brief.\"this statute still threatens to have an undue censorial effect on speech no differently than the cda,\" rich says.federal district court judge lowell a. reed jr. last november temporarily blocked prosecutors from enforcing the child online protection act, or copa. reed ruled that the law likely violates the first amendment. the trial is scheduled to begin 20 january.the plan to submit a friend-of-the-court brief began at a december meeting of the association of american publishers' freedom to read committee. alarmed by copa, the members voted to ask their first amendment lawyer, bruce rich, to get to work.\"the committee believes that no matter what else happened, it was very important to provide amicus support for the aclu in philadelphia,\" says judy platt, aap's communications director.as other groups lent their aid, brief drafts began to flow through fax machines. as of friday afternoon, the american society of newspaper editors, the newspaper association of america, the internet alliance, the commercial internet exchange, people for the american way, bibliobytes, and a dozen other groups had agreed to sign on.\"the group sees a greater emphasis on the least restrictive approach and filtering software that is available to parents. this is a better solution than a government-mandated program that dumbs down the internet to a level of a minor,\" said david horowitz, executive director of the media coalition, which helped with the brief.\"we have been in very close contact with them and we're delighted they're doing it,\" said ann beeson, aclu national staff attorney.but there's still one possible roadblock: the judge himself. at a recent status conference, reed told attorneys that he wasn't fond of the idea of an amicus brief, which is usually not filed until a lawsuit reaches an appeals court.further complicating matters for rich and his allies is the department of justice, which is defending the law and could object to the amicus brief.as of friday evening, government attorneys hadn't said what their decision would be.many of the organizations that will join rich are former allies in a successful lawsuit challenging the original communications decency act. the aclu was first to file its cda i case in january 1996, but a coalition of other groups -- librarians, high-tech firms, and trade associations -- launched a parallel lawsuit a few weeks later.this time, though, they're inclined to let the aclu go it alone. for one thing, a lawsuit will take longer and cost more. it won't slide along the greased rails that the first case did, thanks to an extra-speedy appeals process that was part of the law.the groups have settled on a wait-and-see approach and will make a decision after this month's trial.\"why do this unless there's value added?\" asks alan davidson, staff counsel for the center for democracy and technology, which organized the previous suit. \"it really is going to depend on what happens in philadelphia to a large extent.\"\"it really does burden a broad category of mainstream speakers -- that is the no. 1 point the brief tries to reiterate,\" davidson says. \"this is not just about fringe speakers or commercial 'pornography.' this has the potential to restrict a broad range of speech.\"anti-porn groups including enough is enough and the national law center for families and children have endorsed copa, saying it's necessary to protect children who could easily stumble across sexually explicit web sites and the law will only restrict hard-core pornography.opponents disagree. a forthcoming analysis from the cato institute lists cases where courts have declared classic books like fanny hill and one flew over the cuckoo's nest to be \"harmful to minors.\"related wired links:<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.wired.com/news/images/pix155.gif\"/>an easy win for free speech20.nov.98judge blocks anti-smut law19.nov.98a whiff of cda
