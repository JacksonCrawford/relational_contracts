joe firmage has money to burn.", "author": "reuters", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "01.11.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "the x-files would call it the case of the ceo and the ufos.joe firmage, who at the age of 28 has made not one but two fortunes in silicon valley, has quit the us$2 billion company he co-founded to promote what he says could be \"the most important news event in 2000 years\" -- humanity's potential rendezvous with space aliens.\"there is truth to the ufo phenomenon, that is undeniable. the evidence is overwhelming from around the globe,\" firmage told reuters in an interview. \"to deny it is to simply stick your head in the sand.\"firmage is so convinced that the time has come to popularize a broader vision of mankind's place in the cosmos that he has quit his job at usweb/cks, the silicon valley internet marketing and consulting firm, and is now devoting himself to broadening scientific inquiry into ufos and uncovering what he believes is a government conspiracy to conceal evidence.\"we trivialize everything, we turn everything into the x-files,\" said firmage, who himself has been dubbed the \"fox mulder of silicon valley\" after the hero of the television series.\"what i'm saying is, there are patterns there that we should pay attention to and not ignore. i'm not praying for a spacecraft to come pick me up, i'm just saying there is good, rational, left-brain evidence of things out there.\"backed by his computer fortune, firmage has sought to explore a variety of theories regarding ufos, including one that claims many recent scientific advances -- including semiconductors, fiber optics, and lasers -- can be traced back to technology recovered from a purported 1947 alien spaceship crash in roswell, new mexico, which was covered up by the government.\"outright rejection of the evidence without comprehensive review of the research in print across hundreds of books is close-minded, unscientific, and indeed irresponsible in the extreme,\" firmage wrote in one recent essay on the subject, which he believes should be explored further before it is dismissed.\"it is also quite understandable, given decades of government disinformation ... specifically designed to create a 'giggle factor' surrounding the subject.\"firmage's credentials as a ufo buff are overshadowed only by his track record as a computer industry entrepreneur.a physics major at the university of utah, firmage was 18 when he formed his first company, serius, which specialized in writing computer operating system codes. that was sold to novell in 1993 for $24 million, and firmage served as novell's vice president of networking strategy until 1995 when he left to form usweb (uswb). last month, usweb completed a merger with cks group to form a $2.1 billion powerhouse that employs 1,950 people.firmage said saturday he decided to leave the new company -- having lost his position as ceo to former oracle executive robert shaw -- after concluding that his views on the ufo issue could hurt the company's reputation.\"the subject matter that i am indeed writing about is inherently controversial. i do not wish to subject the company to any sort of credibility deficit,\" firmage said.shaw said in an interview in saturday's san francisco chronicle that firmage's departure was entirely voluntary. \"joe is a visionary and he should be quite proud of what he accomplished,\" shaw said.\"this move should demonstrate to the public and the employees that he always put the interests of the company first.\"now, firmage says, he will work full time to expand and popularize his views, which are summed up in a gigantic, 600-page manifesto entitled the truth, now posted on the internet.in this work, which the author describes as a synthesis of science and faith, firmage looks back at the history of human society and religion and ahead to what he expects will be the next major scientific breakthrough: the victory over gravity and the development of space travel.\"then, all of our presumptions against the extraterrestrial hypothesis will go away,\" firmage said. \"if we can travel to another star, why can't others?\"the truth also contains new documents from a source firmage calls the \"deep throat of cyberspace,\" which he says may shed new light on ufos in general and the roswell incident in particular, including what purport to be memos on the subject from president truman and scientists albert einstein and robert oppenheimer.while firmage's campaign has provoked mostly shrugs from his fellow computer whizzes in silicon valley, he said he is determined to continue working to prepare humanity for outer space and whatever it might find there.\"ultimately, history will be my judge,\" firmage said. \"i am making my best effort to help my friends out in the world take a look at the big picture, to look up into the stars tonight and consider the possibility that i might just be right.\"*copyright\u00a9 1999 reuters limited.*b"}
