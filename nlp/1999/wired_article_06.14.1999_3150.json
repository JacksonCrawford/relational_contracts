- - - -but analysts do not expect global crossing, a telecommunications upstart led by gary winnick, a former associate of junk-bond king michael milken, to slip away without a fight.qwest's offer for us west represents a 25 percent premium over the original value of global crossing's bid, and its offer for frontier is 19 percent higher than global crossing's. analysts said qwest (qwst) and global crossing (gblx), both wall street darlings with high-flying stocks, have the ability to raise their bids if necessary.baby bell us west (usw) said its board of directors will review qwest's offer, but the company declined further comment. frontier (fro) and global crossing could not be immediately reached for comment.qwest's unsolicited offer for us west and frontier marks the second hostile-takeover bid launched this year in the telecommunications industry. at&t, the largest us phone company, recently won its battle to buy cable television company mediaone group, wresting it away from comcast.in that deal, comcast agreed to back down only after getting several lucrative cable assets from at&t. analysts said a similar scenario could play out in the fight for us west and frontier with qwest and global crossing reaching a compromise and separating the assets they want most.qwest's bid for us west and frontier also continues to intertwine the already complicated relationships in the telecommunications industry. us west, regardless of whether it completes its planned $37 billion marriage with global crossing, plans to buy 9.5 percent of global crossing. if qwest wins us west's hand, it would then gain that stake in its rival.\"we fully recognize as a result of being able to acquire us west that their investment in global crossing would be included, and that would be fine with us,\" mohebbi said.bellsouth, the atlanta-based baby bell, also stands to gain much in this battle. bellsouth has a marketing partnership with qwest and also owns 10 percent. bellsouth last week said it was considering increasing its stake in qwest. if qwest is victorious in its bids, bellsouth will hold a stake in the combined qwest-us west-frontier and the stake in global crossing.\"my guess right now is that qwest is acting on the behalf of bellsouth. bellsouth is in the background of this and has much to gain,\" said berge ayvazian, a telecommunications analyst with the yankee group.mohebbi said qwest briefed bellsouth last week on its plans to bid for us west and frontier. bellsouth could not be immediately reached for comment on sunday.mohebbi said a combined qwest-us west-frontier would create a stronger marketing partner for bellsouth and together the companies could offer a broader package of services and bring new products to market faster.he said it decided to bid for us west rather than bellsouth, despite their existing relationship, for several reasons. both us west and qwest are based in denver, and us west has been ahead of other baby bells in rolling out high-speed data and internet services.qwest said it was also interested in us west's fast-growing wireless business, which holds licenses covering 22 million potential customers. \"this gives us an edge over some of the other new-generation companies out there that do not have wireless properties.... working with other players in the market, we could provide extended wireless coverage in territory and out of territory,\" mohebbi said.qwest's bid for us west faces several regulatory hurdles. under the 1996 telecommunications act, the baby bells can not provide long-distance service in their home regions until they open their local markets to competition. qwest said that it would sell the long-distance assets in us west's region or postpone long-distance revenues in that territory until us west gains long-distance approval.mohebbi said the long-distance business in us west's 14-state territory from minnesota to washington represents less than 6 percent of qwest's revenues and would represent less than 1 percent of the combined company's revenues.copyright"}
