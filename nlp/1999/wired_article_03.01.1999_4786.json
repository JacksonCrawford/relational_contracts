(there is a song about a former female lover.) now her smart-as-a-whip edge attacks social politics. indeed, it's her personal growth that's most riveting. her spirit is summed up on the raucous closing jam, on which she riffs, tongue firmly in cheek, \"i will not be afraid to let my talents shine.\"hank dogsbareback (hannibal)some records demand a nighttime intimacy - curtains closed, the sense of darkness outside - to open up. that's the way of the hank dogs. the vocals and music (acoustic and folky) seduce softly, but the words belie the mood, revealing a dangerous edge. nick drake mastered this quality, and these are his natural heirs. they draw you in with a velvet glove; it's only too late that you realize it's holding a sharp sword.rachmaninoffa window in time: rachmaninoff performs his solo piano works (telarc)though he's been dead 56 years, russian pianist sergei rachmaninoff's new cd teems with life. inventor wayne stahnke's electronic reproducing piano reanimates 19 of rachmaninoff's pieces and reestablishes his principal status. culling from antiquated piano-roll recordings made throughout rachmaninoff's career, stahnke processed and translated his data to include pedaling, phrasing, and other subtleties.the pianist's well-known arrangement of rimsky-korsakov's \"flight of the bumblebee\" (1929) proves rachmaninoff was as nimble as he was powerful.hivedevious methods (ffrr)proving there might yet be hope for american breakbeat culture, hive pieces together crisp frantic percussion, menacing keyboards, thrashing guitars, and conspiracy-theory vocal snippets. most potent as a junglist, hive shines brightest with the rattle and drum of \"weapons of mass destruction\" and the ominous descending bass patterns of \"one way path.\"miles davisthe complete bitches brew sessions (columbia/legacy)carlos santana once said that hearing bitches brew for the first time was like growing up in a grass hut, stepping outside one day, and seeing a sliding glass door on a skyscraper. though davis's 1970 double album wasn't the first to mix rock instrumentation, funk grooves, and the jazz \"cry,\" the electrified swamp of bitches brew still bristles the hairs on the back of your neck with its primordial terrifying majesty.a revelation, this four-cd set unearths 90 minutes of unreleased jams. while the original album emphasized urban ferocity, the discoveries here take the meditative serenity of davis's in a silent way a light-year deeper into indian-inflected space.street credcheap power towerthe world as interfaceo mighty layout-o-matik!t1 rextake the body!don't leave home without itpage after pagemillennial checkupcinema undergroundpocket serverthe games girls playmusicjust outta betareadmefind your typeyou've got junk mailcontributors"}
