does he not wish he were getting more recognition?\"i hope not. but how can i know for sure? i've got an ego like everyone else. i'm sure my ego wants me to be more famous. i don't know.\"in a nutshell, stallman believes that software must be free, not necessarily available for nothing, but free to be copied, modified, distributed, shared, and fixed.\"i'm not against commercial anything,\" stallman said. \"i'm against proprietary software that divides and conquers the users.\"unlike commercial software, which is proprietary, free-software programmers don't have to solve the same problems over and over. they keep improving on the work that came before, like the scientific method.however, in stallman's eyes, the programming community is more interested in talking about practical issues, like performance -- an anathema to stallman.and this conflict is partly why stallman is marginalized. most people don't want to talk about freedom. there's been a splintering of the movement: away from free software created by ideologues to open-source software created by business-friendly pragmatists like torvalds.\"[torvalds] is basically an engineer,\" stallman said. \"he likes free software, but isn't concerned with issues of freedom. that's why i'm unhappy when the gnu system is called linux.... people are no longer exposed to the philosophical views of the gnu project.\"does nomenclature matter to the geeks on the show floor? a number of showgoers say they felt in their hearts the correct name was gnu/linux, but it was easier just to call it linux.\"i recognize it as gnu/linux but i don't call it gnu/linux because i'm lazy,\" says one attendee. \"i agree that stallman didn't get the recognition he deserves, but that's partly because of his abrasive personality.\"related wired links:<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.wired.com/news/images/pix155.gif\"/>linux, meet opera3.mar.99the linux free-for-all3.mar.99linux on board3.mar.99linux gives new life to old macs2.mar.99linux meets main street2.mar.99freed software winning support, making waves30.jan.98"}
