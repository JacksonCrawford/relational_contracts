(assuming your intelligent agent's no smarter than you are.) the real draw, however, is its tapeless-vcr function, which lets you capture up to 40 hours of high-quality signal without fumbling for videotapes. fresh programming guides download every day at 4 a.m. so you don't have to wait for the endless scroll of the prevue channel. and, thanks to the high-capacity hard drive and intelligent streaming, you can pause and rewind live broadcasts in progress. tivo personal television service: $10 per month; receiver: from $500. tivo: www.tivo.com.__ for the birds __ferocious finches? bellicose bluebirds? as hitchcock showed us, some fowl are best viewed from afar. this tiny videocam is the first designed specifically for remote surveillance of feeders and birdbaths. the weather-resistant digital ccd cam sends ringside images and sounds to your tv or vcr. just string the included cable from the 12-inch gooseneck to your house and you can watch rare species from hundreds of feet away. or link the birdcam to the web for a live, fair-feathered broadcast from your homepage. birdcam: $399. logic product development: +1 (612) 672 9495, www.teamlogica.com.__ instrumental __like the teletubbies, it was created in the uk and meant for children, but once the club scene discovered the little infinite frequency expander - well, it took on a life of its own. holding the small wooden gadget in one hand, you tweak the eight unlabeled knobs on top, controlling the sound from a deep bass to a screeching high note. meanwhile, the thing in the middle that looks like a ping-pong ball pulses light and changes color to the music. life: \u00a3154 ($255). technomage: +44 (1597) 822138, www.technomage.freeserve.co.uk.__ soft ware __recently rolled out of the labs, the smart keyboard is a natural fit when space is at a premium. a quarter-inch thick and almost 20 inches long, the lithe device can be coiled into a cylinder less than 3 inches in diameter. the letters are etched in rubber to make them abrasion proof, and the keys are raised bumps - a little tough to touch-type on, at first. but the board is sealed with a special material that's impervious to oil, industrial disinfectants, and, more important, water - meaning you can email from the comfort of your bubble bath. smart rollable keyboard: \u00a369.95 ($117). magnate distribution: +44 (151) 242 9500.*thanks to david cohen. *"}
