you've got to write something inspirational,'\" baldwin said. the two were up to their eyeballs in rejection letters, lessard recalls, when they resorted to plan b.\"we were to the point of tying a scsi cable to our necks when we decided to put up a web site,\" lessard recalls.never having built a site before, lessard says he stole the source code for the zine from news satire site the onion, and supplemented it with graphics surreptitiously lifted from other sites. the result is a web site rife with coding errors, misplaced tags, and oversize fonts.nevertheless, the site did get the two what they wanted: enough attention to finally secure a book contract. net slaves: true tales of working the web is set to be published in october by mcgraw hill.lessard describes the book as a sort of digital-era equivalent to studs terkel's working, a 1970s classic that attempted to classify the typical roles of the american worker. the authors tried a similar formula with netslaves, laying out a classification system that encompasses everything from obscure zine-writing \"mole people\" to stock-zillionaire \"robber barons.\"baldwin says the classification system will reassure fellow net slaves that there are plenty of people in the business who aren't getting rich.\"i think, for the internet worker, what makes the dissatisfaction level fairly high is they're constantly reading news items about how some 15-year-old ceo gets a us$50 million investment from paul allen,\" he said. some kind of reality check is sorely needed.of course, it's uncertain how long the prematurely cantankerous co-authors will be able to provide that sort of reality check. if the kudos keep rolling in, it looks like lessard and baldwin might even fail at maintaining their image as failures.lessard, however, is working to preserve his cranky attitude.his grouchiness and skepticism may have cost him his first million in 1997, when he walked out of a gig at online community site the globe, a company now worth half a billion dollars. lessard says he pegged the company as a definite loser when he started the job in a cramped, smelly office in lower manhattan. he left just a few months before the company's legendary stock offering, which made its just-out-of-college founders instant multi-millionaires.\"as i'm resigning, my 24-year-old unshaven boss says to me, 'do what you want, but you're going to miss out on the ipo.' i said, 'ipo? you don't even have a fucking network.'\"oops."}
