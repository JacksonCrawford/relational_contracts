how do i change fonts on this screen?\" -- to distract the hacker from inflicting more damage.on another site, a regular participant threatened suicide when she lost custody of her child in a court battle. there, sensitive hosting helped an established community take care of one of its own.blue barn has developed an extensive program to train hosts to cope with online environments. sinel said, \"you have to take crap from 100 simultaneous chatters, all wanting the host to break down somehow.\" born community leaders, however, can turn up in unlikely places.while searching for music-savvy hosts for n2k's rocktropolis chat rooms, one name kept coming up: a fan named vera, who was always on top of the latest releases and could spout discographies from hendrix to bush. \"she was definitely the hippest rock 'n' roll chatter,\" sinel recalled.when blue barn's director of host management phoned vera for an interview, he was surprised to learn that vera is a 70-year-old part-time nurse. vera still works for blue barn.\"hosting talent is almost 100 percent intuitive,\" said kaye.part of that talent is knowing when to let the conversation follow its own impulses and when to rein it in. sometimes, said sinel, an uptight client can make things worse. one sports client demanded that visitors be booted off the site for criticizing players' performances, with no warning and no explanation.\"we had people logging back in saying, 'hey, why did i get bumped?' that caused so much harm,\" sinel said. \"[the client] wasn't even allowing the chatters to act as they would in the stands at the event.\"kaye added, \"protecting the community is not just a matter of delete, delete, delete.\"though the word \"community\" may seem as eligible for the buzzword graveyard as \"portal\" will be in about 15 minutes or so, kaye and sinel draw parallels between expert hosting on e-commerce sites and the old-fashioned business values of taking care of your customer.\"community should be nothing new to corporations,\" sinel said. \"it's how you answer your email, how you handle customer service. almost everything we do is about responsiveness.\""}
