and why couldn't i burn a regular cd-r disc in the drive?so i called the folks at hp and sonic foundry to get some answers.apparently, one of the protections built into the siren software --put in to appease the gods of the music industry -- is the \"serial copy management system\" (scms), which is used to prevent multiple copies of digital music being made. the scms -- ironically pronounced \"scums\" -- bit adds information to the data stream so that it cannot be recopied.with professional recording decks and higher-end sonic foundry software, the scms information can be eliminated, but with siren's mass-market software it's locked in.\"with siren being much more of a mass-appealing product, with people that are unaware of how pirating issues affect the industry, we are probably going to put in some protective barriers just to let them know that we are really taking the high road on that issue,\" said dave chaimson, a product manager with sonic foundry.george prokop, product manager for the cd-writer music said that hp wanted to respect the wishes of the recording industry even though its secure digital music initiative isn't cooked yet.\"there may be faster ways to copy data, but not recognizing copyright issues, which was one of our number one goals,\" said prokop.\"people ask, 'are you sdmi compliant?' we can't tell, because the spec isn't solid enough to know. but we know the direction they're moving, and we'll do the best job we can meeting those needs,\" explained prokop.\"our total solution will only work with the cd-r digital audio media, so that if copyrighted material is being copied, then we meet the direction and goals of sdmi.\"on a recommendation from a friend, i decided to get a copy of adaptec's new easy cd creator 4 as a faster alternative. i installed the software on my home computer and burned a cd track, all within about 10 minutes.no buffer underrun problems this time, and it allowed me to use a cd-r disc and burn at 4x, thwarting the wishes of the riaa while speeding up the process immensely.easy cd creator also allows you to copy discs you've previously burned, record music from lps, and damn near anything else you would want to do with a drive. so finally, after a few days of wrangling, i got what i wanted out of the drive.it's hard to fault hp for designing a drive that takes copyright protection seriously, but its also hard to accept a drive that cripples its own capabilities with restrictive software. granted, the workaround is fairly simple -- i.e., buy and install new cd-storage software -- but why should i have to shell out another $50-$100 and install extra software after i already burned $300 on the drive?i realized that the hoops i had to jump through to get the cd-writer music to perform is only a harbinger of hassles to come: as sdmi makes its way into the mainstream next year (or the year after?) hardware manufacturers will be forced to support the specifications or meet the riaa in court.i've spent a good chunk of my income throughout my life on music -- from 8-tracks in grade school, to lps in middle school, to $20 concert t-shirts, and, for some 15 years, $15 cds -- and i've earned a few liberties when it comes to mixing and matching my music collection. i don't think i need the riaa policing me in my own home.my guess is that i'm not alone."}
