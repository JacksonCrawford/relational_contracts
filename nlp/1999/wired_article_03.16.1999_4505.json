(wired ventures, the parent company of wired news, is also a truste licensee.)as one of truste's primary sponsors, microsoft gives the organization $100,000 a year in cash or contributions, such as software. but it is truste's job to investigate possible violations by its licensees.\"this whole process will get extremely close scrutiny, both on people reading the fine details of what microsoft says it's doing, and really reading the fine details on what kind of compliance auditing truste brings to bear -- and what the resolution process is,\" said truste president lori fena.if, after a five-day preliminary evaluation, truste decides to investigate, it will voice its complaint to microsoft and give the company five days to respond.\"based on their response ... we would then look at doing an on-site audit,\" explained paola benassi, product operations manager at truste."}
