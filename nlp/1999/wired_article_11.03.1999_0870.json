micropayment standards, which would give net users pay-as-you-go surfing. tania hershman reports from tel aviv, israel.", "author": "tania hershman", "category": "science", "type": "article", "timestamp": "11.03.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "tel aviv, israel -- the era of almost-everything-free-on-the-internet may be evolving into the age of the micropayment with new software from ibm and compaq, who are pushing for new net standards to hurry things along. if the standards are adopted, micropayments would allow web users to make monetary transactions over the net for as little as a few cents. up until now, the cost of processing such small fees has been impractical for sites.\"micropayments are for anything that is too inexpensive to pay by credit card,\" says amir herzberg, manager of e-business and security technologies at ibm's research lab in haifa, israel. \"this enables people to sell stuff on the net for small sums -- the middle ground between free and expensive.\"ibm has developed its own micropayments technology. herzberg and his colleagues hope the internet engineering task force (ietf) will incorporate some of its features when it adopts micropayment standards.the ietf will discuss micropayments for the first time at its next meeting in washington on 8 november. the informal gathering, known as a \"birds of a feather\" meeting, is a chance for interested parties to chew the fat and attempt to persuade the ietf to form an official working group on micropayments.one of the main things herzberg is pushing for is a unique hypertext link for micropayment. with ibm software, the cursor changes to a dollar sign when users mouse over items for which micropayments are available.russ jones, business manager of compaq\u2019s millicent micropayment technology, agrees with the need for a standard, particularly hypertext markup language for a micropayment link.\"without any existing standard, each micropayment supplier has had to invent a new way to indicate the price of a url,\" jones explained. \"standardized pricing markup will do for internet content what the universal bar code standard did for retail merchants.\"users can also configure the tool to accept all micropayments under us$1 with simply a mouse click, but can also configure it to display a dialog box asking whether to proceed with the transaction if the sum exceeds $1.the ibm technology allows isps, telecommunications companies, banks, or altogether new billing entities to handle the actual transfer of money. the system also incorporates a range of authorization and security options.as useful as micropayments may be in taking money from web surfers, the charges can also be reversed.\"if you want people to come and try your software,\" says herzberg, \"give them five to 10 cents. we believe this could be very attractive. and it could be used for gambling. it would be nice to have a casino that pays money on the spot.\"ibm is not necessarily endorsing gambling, but it is exploring all possible uses for the new technology, as is compaq.\"millicent can be used by web sites to build any number of parallel online revenue models through the simultaneous use of pay-per-click purchases, subscriptions, and advertising,\" said millicent\u2019s russ jones. \"it can also be used to offer promotional incentives, issue and track loyalty points, and make direct monetary payments to users.\"with or without a standard, micropayment revenues may allow web sites to focus on content and services, rather than advertising income. but jones doesn't believe that the banner ad will be banished.\"the point of microcommerce is not to compete with advertising or start charging for free content,\" he said. \"the real opportunity is to bring new premium content and innovative services to the web.\"improved content and services sound promising, but paul hagen, senior analyst with the forrester group, is less enthusiastic about micropayments.\"i don't believe micropayments will be prevalent any time soon,\" hagen said. \"i think the way that most sites will deal with small transactions is to keep track of them and roll them up into a monthly or a triggered credit card transaction. in other words, the wall street journal will take a credit card for a pre-pay or when the downloads of articles hits $25, it will hit the credit card. so, the transactions are really macro -- they just end up being chits that add up (or wind down).\"not surprisingly, herzberg of ibm does not agree.\"this is a pretty typical position of quite a lot of the analysts -- but a wrong one,\" he said. \"customers really are reluctant to subscribe -- or even give their credit card -- to a site so the site will accumulate charges. a small percentage of customers who trust a specific site and are very interested in its contents may go ahead, but most customers -- definitely impulse buyers -- are lost.\""}
