(between nuvomedia's rocket ebook and futurama, rocket ships are sure to replace angels as the next design plague.)shiny packages and color screens alone will not topple 3com's elegantly simple palm. but casio developed its own easy-to-use menu, which covers the ce desktop with a palm-like program launcher. and while its giant thumb-powered cursor may make it look like you're playing tetris instead of crunching spreadsheets, at least the screen won't remind you of being at the office.e-100: $499. casio: street credroom serviceorganize in stereoa time to gromany unhappy returnsthe wrath of youking of lost vegastouchscreens are betterurban legendmusicjust outta betareadmehere to reternitynatural selectionexquisite computingno village idiothigh dramacontributors"}
