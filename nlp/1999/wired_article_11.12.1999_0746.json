well, there's this matter of moore publishing's apparent side business -- cybersquatting.moore owns dozens of urls, including campaign-related domains like \"whitmanforsenate.com,\" names of other database competitors, and even the names of some prominent law firms, including steptoejohnson.com. sweetland wouldn't confirm that his client's domains were for sale.to continue. after the initial \"crack,\" sweetland contacted steptoe & johnson and demanded an explanation. steptoe denied all guilt. in early september, moore publishing filed suit in jackson's court, demanding steptoe pony up $800,000 to pay for its supposed misdeeds.steptoe refused the proposed settlement and filed a motion to dismiss the case, countering that there had been no hack. the law firm said one of its employees \"did the internet equivalent of knocking on the wrong door,\" accidentally ending up at dig dirt when he'd been headed for cdb infotek.moore's suit, claimed steptoe, was \"yet another way of making money from the pernicious activity of cyber-squatting.\"meanwhile, according to the expanded moore suit filed this week, a whole new wave of steptoe-led computer attacks was already under way.the attacks began shortly after sweetland contacted steptoe about the first \"attack\" in early august, the suit charges. steptoe tapped one of its computer systems employees, thomas felt, to investigate moore publishing's claims.moore publishing sites were subsequently hit by a wave of denial-of-service attacks, apparently designed to overwhelm moore's servers. moore determined the attacks were originating in the servers of a virginia net hosting company.sweetland subpoenaed the hosting company's records, which revealed the precise origin of the assault: the account of one lois gloor, a furniture store owner in alexandria.sweetland called gloor. she had no clue what he was talking about, he said. but she did say a part-time consultant had recently helped set up all her computer systems. the consultant's name: thomas felt.according to sweetland, felt swiped gloor's passwords and account info, using them first to launch numerous assaults against moore publishing in early september, then to post defamatory messages about moore on usenet.one such post read, in part: \"i guess business must be bad ... now they are trying to shake down law firms ... ask michael why he has filed a sham lawsuit against steptoe.... i guess he needs the money. just thought everyone should know what kind of people these guys are ... the lowest of the low, and now they are turning to computer crime.\"as a result of the supposed identity heist and the usenet posts, moore publishing has expanded its case to include charges of computer fraud and defamation.was the supposed assault on dig dirt ordered from on high within steptoe? sweetland said he doesn't think so.\"it looks to me like a bunch of cowboys in the computer department went off the reservation,\" he said.that doesn't absolve steptoe of responsibility, said sweetland. and if someone in the firm was upset by moore's first suit or his client's apparently self-interested ownership of the steptoejohnson.com domain, they chose a poor way to show it.\"to the extent that steptoe johnson had any contention with [moore's] use of the [steptoejohnson.com] domain, there are legitimate avenues of redress,\" he said. \"they could have gone to nsi, but they didn't. what you can't do is hack, defame, and use denial-of-service attacks, and that's what happened.\"steptoe undoubtedly will offer up a different version of events, and it'll be up to judge jackson to decide what's what.after his experiences with the microsoft trial, jackson should have a good grasp of the terrain.\"he's probably one of the most computer-savvy judges out there, by necessity,\" said sweetland."}
