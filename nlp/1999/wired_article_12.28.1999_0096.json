unemployed. he spent six months this year at the petra hotel in jerusalem's old city, paying 15 shekels (us$4) a day, soliciting donations of cigarettes and joints from fellow lodgers. he is not shy about singing the praises of beautiful women, particularly in their presence, and like many israelis, he carries a cell phone with him at all times.miles professes to be the messiah.the petra hotel has become a favorite waystation for some of the more fervent religious visitors flocking to jerusalem on the eve of the millennium. jews, christians, and muslim lodgers sit in the hotel's spacious lounges, studying the torah, the bible, the koran. others passionately discuss a piece of scripture or the latest religious conspiracy-theory gossip. miles often preached to the guests.\"the reason for the creation is for god to understand himself,\" miles said of his calling. \"god takes this form to understand relationships between the one and the multitude, and zero and infinity. it is my task as the messiah to help god understand this.\"the petra, nestled inside jaffa gate in the arab-christian quarter of the old city, has been in and out of operation since 1830, making it the oldest hotel in jerusalem. once, when it was known as the hotel mediterranean, it was more upscale, boasting mark twain and herman melville as guests. melville is said to have written part of moby dick in one of the rooms.today, backpackers and other budget travelers traipse through the petra on their way to and from egypt, tel aviv, or their kibbutzim. the police pay frequent visits from their station across the street, keeping tabs on the hotel's revolving cast of self-proclaimed prophets.\"there is more police visibility than you would have seen in the past,\" said linda menuchin, a spokeswoman for israel's ministry for internal security. \"we have added three new police stations in the old city.a special guard assigned to holy places frequently patrols holy sepulchre, the church that some christians believe was built on the site of the tomb in which christ's body was placed after his crucifixion.jerusalem has always been a sacred spot: the old city enshrines the relics and memories of three of the world's great religions. up to 4 million people are expected to visit israel in 2000, many of them on spiritual pilgrimages. israeli police are on high alert these days, looking out for the people visiting the city to celebrate the coming millennium. they're there to protect, menuchin says, not provoke.a special millennium task force that includes members of mossad, israel's domestic and foreign intelligence service, is patrolling jerusalem's streets. it has questioned, arrested, and even deported members of groups suspected of violent plots aimed at triggering biblical prophesies.besides his job of saving the world, miles confesses to a dark side. he claims he is also the antichrist, linguistically tied to romulus, the founder of rome who murdered his brother, and to alleged serbian war criminal slobodan milosevic. bad things tend to occur when he is angry or in pain, he said. \"many people will tell you, i said there will be a bomb, and there was. even all the bombs ishmael did was done as a servant of myself.\" miles was not referring to melville's boy among men, but to the ishmael conceived by abraham and hagar -- the offspring who spawned the arab race.gabriel etienne, a 31-year-old employee at the petra, said miles' evangelizing backfired.\"a couple of guests notified the police that [miles] said he was going to lead the arab nations over israel.\" soon after meeting with police, miles left the petra without a forwarding address.miles is not the only self-professed prophet to wear out his welcome at the petra.brother elijah, another self-proclaimed messenger who took up residence there, was picked up by police this fall. the 68-year-old former steelworker from oakland, california said he had been \"walking with god since 1979,\" a journey that kept him in greece and the middle east for 20 years and brought him to jerusalem and the petra hotel several times, most recently in june.\"the truth is all i'm gonna speak. the world is full of liars. look at the white house,\" elijah said. he carried a black briefcase inscribed with large, red english and hebrew lettering: \"elijah, prophet of god.\"\"bill clinton is a 30-degree mason, hillary is a 33, so is bob dole. they're satanists. they're killing mankind for the love of greed and money.\"elijah's rhetoric tends to repel people.\"i made it a point to steer clear of him,\" said anna tsepilovan, 27, a petra guest. \"there was something about him that i didn't trust, didn't want to be around. he was too strong on a certain level, too self-assured, too much on a mission.\"after detaining elijah and administering a psychological evaluation, police persuaded him to leave the country.when asked about brother elijah and the petra hotel, menuchin would only acknowledge, \"we know the general area around [the hotel] is where the prophets like to gather. we know there are people who suffer from the jerusalem syndrome.\"jerusalem syndrome is a psychological disorder suffered by pilgrims who believe themselves to be the messiah or one of god's chosen prophets sent to bring about armageddon. according to the israeli psychiatric society, tens of thousands of millennial visitors may suffer from the disorder to some degree. it expects 800 or more will need hospitalization during their visits to the holy land.the police still haven't cleared the petra of all its prophets. \"there's still plenty of crazy people around here,\" said one of the hotel's clerks, who declined to be identified.grodus, a retired dutchman, has spent more than a year at the petra, sharing a crowded, stuffy room with seven other people for 25 shekels a night, as he, too, awaits the messiah. his god is media- and tech-savvy: all human knowledge is rapidly being recorded on the internet, and at any moment he will broadcast his message to the world on television, grodus said.tsepilovan shared a room with grodus this summer. \"he is very aloof, never really speaks to anyone. once i tried to ask him what he's all about, what he's up to. his mission at this time was to sit in jerusalem and accumulate information that will somehow illuminate the end of the world.\"i'm not sure if he believed himself to be the messiah, but i'm left with the impression he did. he never wants to go into detail or really explain anything. he is a loner.\"meanwhile, the petra register includes a room reservation for a someone by the name of jesus christ, expected on his \"birthday,\" 25 december.next month will tell how these scenarios will play out. before his abrupt departure, miles smiled when asked what would happen if the world rejected him as its messiah.\"it is better to be rejected. i'll marry a dutch girl i met here that i am in love with. i hope that god will not take her away from me.\""}
