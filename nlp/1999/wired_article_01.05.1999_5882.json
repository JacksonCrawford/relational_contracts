(the company's shares closed monday at almost $355.) although amazon said its fourth-quarter sales jumped to $250 million -- four times higher than a year ago -- increased operating costs and aggressive pricing mean all that extra cash won't reduce the bookseller's ongoing losses.\"profitability is important, but it's more important for mature industries,\" said paul merenbloom, an analyst with prudential securities. \"with companies like amazon, the profitability comes on a longer-term basis.\"investors seem comfortable with this perspective. wall street expects amazon to report a loss of 54 cents a share when it posts its quarterly earnings, or lack thereof, later this month. but traders will maintain their focus on those rising revenues, and not on the company's empty pockets. don't be surprised if amazon's stock starts creeping back above $200 within weeks, if not days.the trick to valuing amazon, merenbloom believes, is realizing that the company isn't really an electronic retailer. it's a direct marketer, now in the process of compiling a vast rolodex of customer data.\"companies like amazon are building relationships,\" merenbloom said. \"for investors, if the trajectories are in the right direction, you don't want to take your marbles off the table. the internet is the ideal place for a direct marketer.\"among other net notables, access provider earthlink network (elnk) rose $3.19 to $65.63 after saying it expects fourth-quarter revenue to double to more than $58 million, and that it had signed up its 1 millionth member. industry leader america online (aol), on the other hand, slipped $2.19 to $146.63 as its top headline of the day consisted of cbs news edging out rival abc for the honor of being the service's \"exclusive broadcast news partner.\" stop the presses.in telecom, britain's largest wireless phone service, vodafone group (vod), made a cannonball splash in the pool with a sudden bid to acquire its american counterpart, airtouch communications (ati), for more than $45 billion. the offer comes as airtouch hold talks with another suitor, bell atlantic (bel), on a $43-billion buyout.the prospect of a cross-atlantic bidding war propelled airtouch's stock up $6.75 to $75. investors seemed unsure which romeo would win juliet's hand, so they placed their money in both camps. bell atlantic rose $3.06 to $55, and vodafone was up $4.50 at $179.13.meanwhile, mci worldcom (wcom) gained $5.13 to $75 as the second-biggest us long-distance carrier was reiterated a \"buy\" by salomon smith barney. analyst jack grubman believes the company's stock will rise to $100 within the next year.and equalnet communications (enet) weighed in with news that subscribers now can sign up for its discounted long-distance service via the net. why such a development should send a stock orbital, it's hard to say. but equalnet soared 91 cents, or 94 percent, to $1.88.on the tech front, microsoft (msft) advanced $5.50 to $146.50 as lehman brothers reiterated a \"buy\" rating for the company's shares. the brokerage raised its 12-month price target to $185 from $140.apple computer (aapl) jumped $2.06 to $43.31 after announcing that about 800,000 imacs have been sold since the spiffy machine made its debut in august. it also said lower-priced versions of the imac are on the way -- in a palette of new colors. it's a minor milestone that people are now buying computers to coordinate with their decorating schemes.enterprise software publisher sap (sap) is finding its going tougher. the company's shares fell $2.50 to $32.06 after it warned that fourth-quarter results won't be up to snuff. computer-networking outfit digi international (dgii), meanwhile, shed 25 cents to $9.75 on word that it, too, is looking to come up short in the quarterly-earnings department.daimlerchrysler (dcx) saw its shares downgraded to \"hold\" from \"strong buy\" by warburg dillon read, but still managed to rise $4.44 to $106.13 on speculation that the auto giant may extend its reach to asia by purchasing japan's troubled nissan motor.lastly, mcdonald's (mcd) lost 19 cents to $76.75 after its restaurants in britain were forced to run ads apologizing to customers for having run out of big macs. the chain had expected to sell 2 million big macs during a two-for-one promotion, but found over the weekend that burger-craving britons were seeking about twice this number.hard to say which is more troubling, that we live in a world where a fast-food restaurant would apologize for not having sufficient amounts of chow on hand, or that demand is so strong.and there are still those who scoff that signs of the coming apocalypse aren't everywhere."}
