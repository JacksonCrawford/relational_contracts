to help companies to come into compliance with fair information practices and provide a level of assurance that customers need in order to begin to feel comfortable doing business with that site again.\"pontiac advertising director tom jump confirmed that more than 10,000 people were affected. he said that the company began pulling the contest site down friday morning after being alerted to the problem by wired news.\"clearly the intent was to keep this information private, obviouly you found a break in the code in the system.\"as of friday afternoon, the company had removed the home page for the contest site -- but not the thousands of game piece pages behind it. any one of the 13,000 people who entered the contest could still exploit the problem.a pontiac spokewoman said the company was working to remove the pages from the net, but could not say when that task would be complete.jump said that pontiac would apologize to those affected by the hole, and issue new game pieces with secure id codes."}
