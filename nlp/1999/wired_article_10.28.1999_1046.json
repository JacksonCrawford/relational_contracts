(good thing my girlfriend wasn't around to watch this shameless display of geekdom.)the performance of the system was flawless the whole time i played with it. i tried pointing the wireless transmitter this way and that. i walked around the loft to test the strength of the signal, and the connection never dropped.peder said there is virtually no sound loss because the system uses the 2.4 ghz range, which he characterizes as \"a big fat virtual pipe that is running through all the walls of the home.\" the fcc made the frequency range available about three years ago, and peder said they can program four different frequencies within it. so x10 also has an application to transmit dvds from a pc to a tv, and they have set up their products to use separate frequencies for the audio, voice, data, and video.the sound quality of the mp3s i tested confirmed some of my suspicions about the format in general. while it sounds pretty good over headphones, some sounds aren't true over a stereo system's speakers. hip hop sounds fine, while rock, jazz and pop are sub-par, especially when the cymbals get washed together and sound like a theremin skidding across the pavement.one part of the system which i didn't get a chance to test was the wireless mouse remote control which can act as a universal controller for tv, vcr, lights, and an audio player on your pc. using plug-in software downloaded from x10's site, you can use the mouse remote to switch tracks or adjust volume from a variety of mp3 software, such as musicman, rioport audio manager, liquid audio, musicmatch, winamp, and realjukebox.however, combo mp3/cd player alternatives on the horizon could make the pc-to-stereo less attractive. the mambo-x portable mp3-cd player, announced this week from california-based tagram system, can handle mp3s burned in the cd rewritable format. and then there's hango electronics's personal jukebox, a portable mp3 player with a 4.86 gb hard drive.as the christmas season approaches, get ready for a rush of even more hybrid players that can send your tracks nearly anywhere you want to listen."}
