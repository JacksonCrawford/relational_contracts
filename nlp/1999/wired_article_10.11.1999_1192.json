software and a lightweight device that holds more music than its predecessor.", "author": "jennifer sullivan", "category": "science", "type": "article", "timestamp": "10.11.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "i thought carrying around the flashy diamond rio 500 would probably make me popular at parties, particularly with gadget-loving geeks. although i did get oohs from my unwired friends, i only got a few curious looks in my neighborhood caf&eacte;, or an aloof \"may i see?\" from my mp3-savvy friends. in san francisco, where palm pilots are required fashion accessories, rios aren't all that astonishing.the second-generation rio is sleeker, more durable, lighter, and most importantly -- holds more music. when rio still had a virtual monopoly in the us digital music player market, a device that held just 90 minutes of music wasn't much of a liability.when the likes of creative labs entered the fray with higher capacity players, the rio started to feel the competition.my home computer is not powerfully fabulous enough to use my new us$269 toy -- it has neither windows 98 nor usb support. so, using a usb cable, i hooked up my metallic gray rio to an ibm thinkpad at work. a translucent teal and blue version will be available in november.the rio 500 comes with rioport audio manager software on cd-rom. in the future, you'll be able to use musicmatch and sonic foundry software, and rioport.com is talking to the likes of winamp, according to diamond.i tested how well the software records and manages tunes with a \"they might be giants\" cd. the newbie-friendly software asked if i wanted it to add the song names from the net at cd database before i ripped the songs. it took about 27 minutes to encode 24 songs at the default rate of 128 kbps. but for some reason it missed most of one track.the error could be attributable to a weak battery, since the rio started flashing low battery soon after the encoding was finished. since ripping legal mp3s was a breeze, it was time to move on to the other kind.finding illegal mp3s online is pretty easy, but finding the exact one you want, especially a quality recording, is not. oftentimes, finding one will lead to an overloaded server in finland that takes forever to download.if you know the right sites and search engines -- or if you can use the hacker friendly internet relay chat (irc) to make friends and trade files or gain access to a private ftp server -- you have an almost limitless amount of music at your disposal.i searched for the backstreet boys -- not because i like them, i swear, but because they're so unbelievably popular. it only took about two minutes to find as long as you love me. after i downloaded it, the rio software had no problem finding it on my pc, and adding it to my playlist.even though i've been enjoying digital music for a while, i still love being able to order my playlist just how i want it -- breaking up songs from an album or making digital mixes. my mix was ready to put on the rio -- some tmbg, cake, a track from mk ultra (one of many great indie bands that puts their music out in mp3), and yes, a little backstreet boys.about two minutes after i hit transfer, voil\u00e0, the songs were on the rio.the rio also lets you be a little interactive. while a song is playing, you can scroll through the entire list and select a new one to play. you can hit the \"random\" button which shuffles the order, or create a program list of select songs on the player. and you can store files in different folders to make more rio play lists.i hit play and backstreeet blasted out, sounding as, ahem, \"good\" as the radio or a cd to my unsophisticated ears.other tracks like frank black's \"headache\" had lots of cymbals, and were accompanied by that tinny background hiss that makes audiophiles dread listening to mp3s. rioport's ohlfs said ripping at 256 kb -- the maximum quality level rioport software allows -- would remove some of those artifacts.the rio sports 64mb of memory -- holding about one hour of music -- and you can boost more toward two hours if you add an optional 32 mb for $99. you can also cram in more tunes by decreasing the recording quality.i ripped and ripped some more, when suddenly my software told me i had exceeded my limit of 50 tracks to rip -- and could i please register my software.rioport's ohlfs said the software should provide unlimited ripping for all rio 500 owners, and the original cds that were sent out were buggy. he said the problem would affect less than 5 percent of rio 500 buyers, who could download new software from the site at no charge.the rio 500 also passed my durability test -- throwing it into my jacket pocket with keys that scratch and bump against it, throwing that jacket on the floor, forgetting about its precious cargo inside, and yes, dropping it a few times.unfortunately, battery drain is a real problem with the rio 500. i had to refuel three times in a week and a half of use. but since it only uses a single aa battery, the expense isn't excessive.it\u2019s a convenient way to play music, but if you're looking to listen to other digital music formats, think again, because the rio 500 only plays mp3s.the rio 500 is upgradeable, so that when the second phase of the sdmi spec comes out -- when is still uncertain -- the rio 500 can be updated to incorporate digital rights management technology from intertrust, according to kurt ohlfs, business development manager at rioport.com, a wholly owned subsidiary of diamond multimedia. mike reed, director of access products at diamond said that after updating the rio 500 to make it sdmi-friendly, it will continue to support mp3 playback, and add liquid audio, and microsoft's windows media audio.he said diamond will consider adding other formats if more content is released. the earlier rio 300, however, cannot be upgraded with the sdmi software, said ohlfs.other players that have come out recently support additional music formats, and have added security components that will comply with the recording industry's evolving sdmi specification to fight music piracy. recently, thomson unveiled its lyra, which also supports realnetworks g2 format and is due to ship for christmas. sony will begin selling its ms walkman early next year with support for mp3 and its atrac3 format."}
