definitely, said hunt.\"i don't think anyone's not going to adopt dvd because of a compatibility problem,\" he said. \"i think the benefits of the format will outweigh that problem.\"the large number of matrix complaints may somewhat overstate the problem because so many people are buying it \u2013- the matrix could be the first million-selling dvd. dassa said the return rate for the matrix at his store is less than one percent.the matrix could soon cruise past titanic, the biggest blockbuster of all time in total sales. even though one million titanic discs were stamped and shipped to retailers, it's not flying out the doors. \"titanic missed the boat, so to speak,\" said dassa.\"it sold well, but nothing close to what it would have sold when it was a hot title. i think everyone is sitting on a large stock of titanic right now. they blew it on that one.\"see the latest entertainment photosadding rom to your dvdsee the latest entertainment photosadding rom to your dvd"}
