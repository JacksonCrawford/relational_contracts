after all, newton said friction will cause a moving object to slow down and stop.\"the thing that stops a ball carrier is the momentum exerted by the tackler,\" haase explains. \"the momentum is the product of the mass times the speed, or velocity.\"so if you're going to tackle terrell davis?\"you want to hit him with a lot of momentum -- because he's going to be coming at you with a lot of momentum. the neat thing is that physics tells you that you don't have to be a big guy, or as big as the guy you're hitting. you can be a big guy not moving fast, or a little guy moving very fast, since again, momentum is the product of the mass times the velocity.\"this is what john madden is talking about when he says, \"you gotta get up there and boom! bam! hit 'em before he cuts back and gets going, because once he has a head of steam, he'll just run right through you!\"momentum also explains why huge, relatively slow men can thrive on the defensive line. these great mounds of beef typically run into ball carriers before they've had time to gather much speed; thus, the sheer size of the linemen provides enough momentum to match that of the ball carrier. momentum explains, too, why collisions in the defensive backfield, where players are moving at tremendous speeds, are among the most violent.but haase notes that football players are \"complicated systems,\" what with \"arms, legs, and heads, lots of twisting and turning, and protective equipment\" -- all factors in determining which player and which part of his body bears the brunt of a collision. most collisions, in fact, aren't full-force. a player turns, ducks, or spins to avoid force, or braces to absorb the blow.but what if a collision is dead-on? haase says being drilled by 220-pound linebacker moving at full speed is akin to being hit by a 16-pound bowling ball dropped from the 14th floor of a building.which is why they wear pads.related wired links:<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.wired.com/news/images/pix155.gif\"/>john madden on gridiron tech22.jan.99super bowl's other lineup21.jan.99the medium that made the game9.jan.99the future of football12.jan.99the medium that made the game9.jan.99smart video = smart football7.jan.99"}
