one company whispers the magic words \"auction\" and \".com,\" and another comes up with an ingenious way to lose even more money on the net. you'd think investors would be lined up for a piece of that action.speaking of losing lots of money, online ad agency doubleclick (dclk) fell 19 cents to $87.75 after posting a fourth-quarter loss of 25 cents a share, which was still a penny better than expected by analysts.another big deal in telecom: sbc communications (sbc) will shell out $1.67 billion for comcast's cellular business, garnering an additional 800,000 customers. sbc slid 50 cents to $58.50, while comcast (cmcsa) was up 19 cents at $66.31.general motors (gm) watched its quarterly profit from operations drive 55 percent higher to a record $3.25 a share, splattering the $2.61 expected by analysts. its stock advanced 94 cents to $88.94. meanwhile, amr (amr), parent of american airlines, slid $4.44 to $59.81 after posting a lower-than-expected profit of $1 a share.lastly, the big tobacco companies all got burned after president clinton said the federal government is about to chase them down to recover the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses. philip morris (mo), rjr nabisco holdings (rn), loews (ltr), british american tobacco (bti) -- each took a pounding.gosh, it's getting so a company can't murder its customers without uncle sam sticking his nose in. what's the world coming to?"}
