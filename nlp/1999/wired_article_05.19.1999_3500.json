there's the \"virtual heavy plate mill,\" a cave project that simulates the factory floor and manufacturing processes of a steel mill.corporations profess to love it. previously, they had to craft mechanical prototypes of new designs -- an expensive and laborious process. now they can use a virtual prototype to test ideas. these collaborations seem especially agreeable to linzers, who pride themselves both on their brucknerhaus concert hall and industrial prowess -- leading to it-could-only-happen-here events like musical performances held in blast furnaces.but while the population of linz appreciates traditional art, the ars electronica center can be somewhat befuddling to neophyte visitors, particularly elderly austrians who make up about one-fifth of the museum's patrons.stocker has a simple solution: a garden. older austrians are as manically single-minded about their backyards as the viennese are about mozart. just 10 steps inside the front door of the museum is a small plot of land, about the size of a wading pool, where internet visitors can plant a seed and watch it grow.a word of caution to would-be horticulturists: the museum staff doesn't tend the garden. if you plant a seed by connecting to the web site, you have to come back and care for it as it grows. \"they have to be responsible for a living thing. if they don't water it, it dies,\" stocker says.the \"telegarden\" seems to be a hardy perennial in the ranks of museum favorites, but the problem with being a self-proclaimed museum of the future is that the present has a distressing habit of catching up.concept projects one day can be mass market the next, and what was once an eye-catching 3-d simulation can be tomorrow's mass-market videogame. in one computer lab, stocker eyes the flat-panel displays and sighs.\"when siemens gave them to us, they were state-of-the-art prototype units,\" he says. now they're available at the austrian equivalent of compusa.editor's note: declan mccullagh served on the .net jury during this year's prix ars electronica competition."}
