you complain that we don't get it, and we complain that you won't let us.\"sunday morning and afternoon sessions were punctuated with rousing rounds of \"spot the fed,\" the annual defcon game of outing federal agents.anyone identified as a fed was brought up on stage for questioning. the suspected feds, all of whom were more than willing to whip out badges after a few minutes of interrogation, were dressed almost universally in polo shirts and khakis, their crew-cut stiffness a striking contrast to their black-clad accusers.the audience hurled questions at them like, \"does your office have a ban on furby's?\" and \"what does dana scully [the fictional x-files agent] really look like?\" one fed lost all hope of going undetected by responding, \"never heard of him.\"the day hit high gear with the release show for bo2k, or back orifice 2000, one of the few software announcements that required a sign posted on the door warning that the presentation might be dangerous to people with heart conditions.nineteen of the 20 revered cdc members were present on stage, the most ever assembled in one place. the group took an older-but-wiser tone in its reverberating remonstrations to the audience.\"pick the cause before you pick the site you're gonna hack,\" the group advised, \"and use a fuckin' spell checker!\"despite their bullying tone onstage, members of the cdc said later they're encouraged by the new, younger members of the hacking community.cdc members said they hoped the new rev of back orifice, released under the gnu open source license, would encourage younger hackers to go back to the basics \u2013 scripting code and exploring the technology themselves \u2013 instead of using cookie-cutter programs.\"they look at us up on stage and look at what we're doing, and they know they can't stand up there for doing something stupid,\" said cdc's grand master ratte, mc of the group's gospel-like presentation.but it was another old-school hacker who caused the big scene saturday.  carolyn meinel, a favorite target of many in the defcon crowd, obtained a press pass despite the efforts of several conference organizers.when meinel wandered into the press area (with a sticker on her back that said \"owned\"), a canadian reporter began interviewing her about her relationship with the organizers, asking why she wasn't granted a more civilized reception.meinel was interrupted, then ejected, by conference staff. but not without a fight. it was good sport for the assembled journalists, although the canadian reporter was appalled.\"they invite criminals to speak at their conference, but they deny a freelancer a press pass?\" said david akin, technology reporter for the national post in toronto.emmanuel goldstein of 2600, the hacker quarterly journal and web site, presented a nine-minute preview of his documentary about the arrest and imprisonment of kevin mitnick.goldstein said the documentary was intended to be a counterpoint to the upcoming film, takedown, which mitnick supporters say unfairly casts the hacker as more devious and damaging than he really was.goldstein's presentation was followed by a mysterious \"social engineering contest,\" details of which must remain confidential, since wired news was forcibly ejected from the room.although the weekend was tempered with the expected disagreements between old hackers and young hackers, the media, and even a much-publicized argument within the community itself, defcon 7 was undoubtedly an event to remember.related wired links:coming soon: back orifice 200030.jun.99hacker pundits squabble7.jun.99warnings for would-be crackers2.jun.99the not-so-happy hacker16.dec.98back orifice a pain in the ...?29.jul.98a low-key mitnick protest16.jul.98"}
