cable and broadcasting station has chugged along for years selling reruns of chinese soccer matches and game shows. but now the scrappy, state-funded station an hour's drive south of shanghai has found a new way to earn profits: offering high-speed data services to local banks.it has spent one million yuan (us$120,800) upgrading its network so now its circuits carry not only sports and government newscasts, but price quotations and corporate memos.jiaxing is not the first chinese cable operator to foray into the data services business.dozens of cable tv stations across china are leaping into what is a regulatory gray area. the result, say industry analysts, could be a competitive battle between cable and telephone companies.in qingdao, the local cable company already provides hundreds of customers with local access networks that can carry information faster than isdn lines offered by china telecom, the state phone giant.similar projects are also rolling out in shanghai, dalian, beijing, nanjing, and shenzhen, cable officials said.at the jiaxing station, director xu guanfu tossed cigarettes around a conference table as salesmen from a us company pitched cable modems and other data transmission equipment.\"we're going to try to expand so that it's profitable within three to five years,\" xu said after the meeting.\"these services are consistent with our responsibility as a mouthpiece of the government,\" he said in defence of the politically sensitive project.david long, a salesman from a company called com21 who was making a pitch to the station, said: \"before the internet, china telecom was so lazy.\"\"now they look at cable tv and see a lion awakening.\"china telecom has good reason to be wary.cable tv reaches 80 million chinese households, with higher penetration in rural areas than telephone companies.with tough restrictions on foreign tv programming, and drab fare produced domestically, cable providers will rely increasingly on data services to make money, said david wolf, managing director of claydon gescher associates in beijing.\"whereas espn, playboy and hbo -- premium channels -- drove cable in the us, in china it's going to be data services,\" wolf said.said jin naihui, a senior official with the state administration of radio, film and tv, which oversees china's loose patchwork of cable operators: \"we anticipate that in five years, cable data transmission service revenues will be equal to broadcast service revenues.\"but an all-out battle between cable and telephone operators is still far from certain, with beijing sending mixed signals about its appetite for local competition.senior leaders, including premier zhu rongji and president jiang zemin, have already expended precious political capital to foster competition between telephone carriers.china telecom has been ordered to spin off its profitable mobile phone and paging operations, while the small no. 2 carrier, china unicom, is being beefed up to challenge the old monopoly.this week, china will also unleash a third carrier, china netcom corp, which is building a 15-city, high-speed fiber backbone and which has a license to sell network services to customers including internet service providers and corporations.beijing wants a degree of competition to create \"several domestic champions capable of competing globally,\" said jay hu, director of the us information technology office in beijing.but grassroots competitors in the form of cable companies probably are not part of the picture, he said.the issue has already become a headache in beijing.physical fights have erupted between local telephone and cable officials attempting to wade into one another's businesses.in june, officials from a china telecom branch in hunan province beat up three local cable employees and shot and wounded three others after the cable station confiscated the phone company's new equipment for providing television and data services, a senior cable official said.in a bid to douse the flames, china's cabinet issued a document last month forbidding the two industries from entering one another's traditional businesses.but in a heavy blow, the document also required cable operators to win permission from the ministry of information industry -- which runs china telecom -- before connecting with national telecom networks.if enforced, analysts said the document could prevent cable stations from hooking up to the internet.\"cable operators are trying very hard to break into a market that is still monopolised\" by china telecom, said paul whalley, a director of network solutions for israeli telecom equipment maker eci.\"it's very difficult even in markets that are deregulated,\" he said.copyright"}
