(rose knew her audience well: while in advertising she helped market the harlequin romance series.)before long, there was such a buzz around lip service that rose decided to have paper copies printed up for sale by online bookstores. without the space constraints of physical stores, amazon.com and barnesandnoble.com will let self-published authors sell their work right alongside the bestsellers. amazon.com quickly saw that lip service was not its average independent press book.more than 30 customers posted reviews on the site, most raving about how they couldn't put the book down. at one point, the novel ranked as the 123rd best-selling title among the 4.7 million books stocked by amazon. an editor from simon and schuster's pocket books came upon the glowing reviews while surfing the net and, after a bidding war with other publishers, bought the rights from rose.\"there was really an underground internet groundswell around this author,\" said another pocket books editor, amy pierpont.publishers may be hoping rose's is a one-of-a-kind story that will not upset the usual process through which a writer becomes an author. but if you spend some time surfing around the extensive online literary world, you'll wonder. rose had unusual success when she bypassed the publishing middleman, but several other authors are having more than a taste of it. what it seems the internet is best at is finding an audience for offbeat books. doubleday maintains that it liked lip service all along, but rejected it the first time around because it was not sure how many people would read it. the book is a bit of a hybrid: too risqu\u00e9 to be a soft romance, but because of its clever plot, not your usual trash, either. erotica and romance novels are especially popular genres on the internet, as are some quirky subsets of science fiction.one self-published book described as \"science fiction romance\" drew such a large audience online that the library of congress purchased a copy. another won an award by a major science-fiction writers' association.\"most writers and bookstores are extremely unhappy with the celebrity system that doesn't make room for the eclectic, the innovative, or wacky, weird books,\" said leslie guttman, who recently used the internet to self-publish *message pending, a novel with a wacky narrative that consists of nothing but email messages. while authors like guttman and m.j. rose were happy to perform the multiple tasks of writer, editor, web site designer, and marketing manager if it meant finding an audience, online publishing isn't always such a solo effort.there are a multitude of sites, from petals of life to the hard shell word factory, devoted to promoting independent authors.many have editors and their own selection criteria to help ensure they don't publish unintelligible dreck. some also have royalty systems in place so the author can get paid. not only do these sites improve the financial incentive for publishing online, they may also bring more prestige to the whole system.self-published authors also benefit from online bookstores, which will sell just about anything that is printed and bound.\"we try to make it easy for independent authors,\" said amazon.com spokesman paul capelli.and why not? it all comes down to more books for amazon.com to sell. why settle for 4.7 million? amazon.com said another self-published book that has done very well on its site is jason kelly's high-tech thriller, y2k: it's already too late.readers who are really on the cutting edge may also buy self-published books for electronic download, for example, via the rocket ebook, a pocket book-sized computer made by nuvomedia inc. like amazon.com, nuvomedia has a clear financial incentive in selling these books for download.\"right now, only 10 to 15 percent of the books that are written ever get published,\" said marcus colombano, director of marketing at nuvomedia.one surprising skeptic in all of this is m.j. rose herself. she said that for all the opportunity the internet presents to struggling writers, they still must first write a good book.\"a lot of people get their novels rejected because they are just not good,\" she said.copyright"}
