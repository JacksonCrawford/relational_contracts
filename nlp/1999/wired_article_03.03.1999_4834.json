- - - - -while microsoft's concern is centered on the software world, there are signs that the lockdown could hit other sectors as well. global banking giant national westminster, for example, said last week it has decided to freeze changes to the london-based company's computer systems between october 1999 and february 2000 to ensure a smooth transition.in an enterprise as huge as natwest, investment in new technology runs into hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and involves scores of projects, not just a few lines of dated computer code. natwest said it had put 54 new high-tech retailing processing centers on hold while the bank sorts out y2k-related projects.\"a lot of this [y2k work] has come out of capital budgets,\" said economist cynthia latta of standard & poor's. \"some companies have found y2k costing more than they thought and they're running behind schedule.\"equally unsettling for the economy: if capital budgets have been raided for the relatively non-productive work of fixing computers instead of investing in new growth, a more long-term drag could be forming. \"it's hard to quantify,\" said latta. \"we don't have a [us] recession in our baseline, but we do have slow growth and possible recession early next year.\"the consulting firm forrester research surveyed 50 major companies late last year and found that they will \"buy more pcs over the next 12 months to rid themselves of aging equipment that could cause y2k trouble.\" but then, with production lines churning at full tilt, \"pc buying will fade,\" forrester predicted.the \"buying fade\" will happen late this year as the y2k lockdown begins, says forrester analyst carl howe, who did the much-cited survey.\"people have spent millions of dollars making themselves y2k compliant,\" howe said. \"they're not going to screw it up by buying more at the last minute. they may now just leave it and wait until next year.\"the forrester y2k user survey \"found that people are going into the lockdown phase in the middle of this year,\" howe said.\"when that happens, any spending request is going to be looked at very closely to answer the question 'is this going to make us more y2k compliant or less?'\"but as corporate enterprises take an increasingly cautious approach to handling the y2k problem -- amid worries about legal liabilities and system crashes -- the dramatic growth of the internet is providing a counterbalance.the so-called legacy systems, the aging mainframes, provide the biggest problem for the y2k-readiness experts. those computers use embedded coding written years ago, particularly in the now little-used languages like cobol associated with mainframe computers. a lack of people trained in the virtually defunct cobol has added to the problem.but since the web has largely been built over the past five years, it's considered far less fraught with y2k threats -- indeed most new systems on the shelf now are mostly certified as bug-proof -- and it also holds the promise of fast-growing e-commerce.the growth of great \"web farms,\" armies of small computer servers patched together at large internet sites to handle millions of users, is helping drive the industry's growth.chip giant intel underscored that growth potential last week when it told a conference it was shifting its product development to the internet to capture the $1 trillion it expects from e-commerce by 2002. \"the internet,\" said intel executive vice president paul otellini, \"is as important to intel's future as silicon was in our past.\"in getting set to take on the new millennium, the fast-moving e-commerce boom is reminding people that time waits for no one -- even if it is a bit buggy.\"people are trying to gain competitive advantage in e-commerce,\" said hambrecht and quist analyst walter winnitzki. \"a lot of investment in infrastructure is going towards supporting that. there's some caution over y2k, but companies have to keep moving forward.\"copyright"}
