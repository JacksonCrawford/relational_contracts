buying volvo -- to rekindle investor enthusiasm. tech and net stocks lead wall street higher. by david lazarus.", "author": "david lazarus", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp":

volvo's automobile division, sparked a broad rally thursday that erased much of the damage from the previous day's sell-off. sentiment was running so high, in fact, that not even al \"the hitman\" greenspan could rattle traders with another attack on president clinton's plan to rejigger the social security system.the dow jones industrial average gained 81.10 points to close at 9281.33. the nasdaq composite index rose 70.19 to a record 2477.33, and the s&p 500 was up 22.20 at 1265.37.yahoo (yhoo) advanced $31.88 to $367.75 after announcing the latest in a series of big-bucks internet buyouts. although the deal values geocities at $113.66 a share -- a 51-percent premium over its closing price wednesday -- investors saw the move as a shrewd effort to keep yahoo in the running against the likes of america online and microsoft.\"everyone's trying to create content and community, and keep people at their site,\" said arthur newman, an analyst with gerard klauer mattison. \"this is a reaffirmation that aol was right all along that the web is about content. one of the ways you do this is letting people create their own home pages.\"he added that yahoo's decision to buy geocities was more a response to at home's $6.7 billion acquisition of excite than to aol's $4.2 billion purchase of netscape communications. yahoo doesn't expect to steal away any of aol's 15 million-plus members, but does want to maintain its edge over rival web portals.for its part, geocities (gcty) soared 56 percent to $117.25. the merger news went a long way in diverting attention from the company reporting a fourth-quarter loss of 27 cents a share. yahoo said it expects to take an unspecified charge related to the acquisition in the next quarter.if aol (aol) was feeling any heat from the deal, it didn't show. aol's stock was up $9 at $174.50 after the world's biggest online service reported a 340-percent leap in quarterly earnings to 17 cents a diluted share, topping estimates by 3 cents. revenues from advertising and online transactions rose 66 percent. fittingly, seeing as everyone else is doing it, the company announced a two-for-one stock split.by newman's reckoning, it's lycos (lcos) that's now feeling \"significant catch-up pressure\" as yahoo and excite demonstrate their upward mobility. \"people are looking at lycos and asking what partnership deal they're going to announce,\" he said. \"the ball's in their court.\"lycos, soon-to-be parent of wired news, rose $11.50 to $123, while infoseek (seek) was 18 percent higher at $83.94 as painewebber began coverage of the company with a \"buy\" rating. but the big movers from a day before, amazon.com (amzn) and ebay (ebay), both lost ground.in his appearance before the senate budget committee, greenspan finally staked out his position on high-flying internet stocks. \"is that called investment?\" he wondered.\"undoubtedly, some of these companies, whose stock prices are going through the roof, will succeed,\" the fed chief continued. \"and they very well may justify even higher prices. the vast majority are almost sure to fail.\"you want to bet that mr. g isn't holding a long position in theglobe.com?in the day's other multibillion-dollar headline, ford (f) finally ended weeks of speculation and said it will take over all of volvo's car facilities worldwide. investors gave a lukewarm reception to the news, pushing ford's stock just $1.94 higher to $62.25.almost lost in the dust was one last big-ticket purchase -- trw (trw) slipping 88 cents to $50.25 after it agreed to shell out almost $7 billion for british auto-parts maker lucasvarity.in tech, intel (intc) climbed $4.44 to $137.19 after announcing its own two-for-one stock split, following similar moves by ibm and microsoft. dell computer (dell) rose $5.25 to $93.75, and cisco systems (csco) was up $5.44 at $108.88.on the other hand, database software publisher informix (ifmx) tumbled 12 percent to $11.69 despite posting a better-than-expected quarterly profit of 13 cents a share. investors have been bailing out of enterprise-application firms amid worries that a slowing us economy will result in corporations scaling back their near-term tech investments.gte (gte) advanced $1.75 to $67.94 after revealing a 22-percent increase in quarterly income to 97 cents a share, excluding charges and whatnot. this easily whipped the 88 cents expected by analysts. gte remains on track for its $60 billion merger with bell atlantic.lastly, death merchant -- oops, that should be cigarette maker -- philip morris (mo) gained $2.25 to $ 48.69 even as it reported a 79-percent drop in quarterly income to 11 cents a diluted share. investors forgave the company its billions of dollars in pretax charges stemming from tobacco litigation settlements, and focused instead on a 15-percent increase in domestic business.turns out last november's 38-percent hike in wholesale cigarette prices didn't result in much of a decline in purchases. it just meant more brass in pocket for the marlboro man."}
