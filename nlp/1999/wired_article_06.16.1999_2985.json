as o'scannlain wrote, the riaa's complaint runs \"contrary to the statutory language and common sense.\"the group came to understand that mp3 represents the dawn of a new era, when music won't be burned on a disc and shipped on a truck.the riaa knew that by tying up the rio in the courts and chilling the release of a slew of similar devices, it would only stall the adaption of mp3 and give it more time to develop its own alternative format.the group's mp3 killer is the secure digital music initiative (sdmi), a secure audio format that the association hopes will be built into portable players. the end game is to derail mp3 and protect its franchise.decades ago, the vcr first allowed consumers to time shift television programming to delay sitcoms or soaps for later viewing. similarly, the walkman, and its digital descendent, the rio, allows them to space shift.the riaa said it acted in the interests of everyone in staving off pirates. but mp3 pirate sites are few and far between. the format has instead granted independent artists direct access to fans, which is not in the recording industry's interest.\"we filed this lawsuit because unchecked piracy on the internet threatens the development of a legitimate marketplace for online music, a marketplace that consumers want.\"by effectively holding back a range of devices from the marketplace with a frivolous and stupid lawsuit, the riaa has done more to hold back the adoption of an online music marketplace than any teenage bedroom pirate could ever hope to achieve.consumers deserve unbridled access to as much software and hardware as they want to shuttle their music, words, and sounds into as many formats as they wish. picture car stereos that can store your entire library of jazz recordings, or personal headsets weighing less than a pencil that can bank a workout's worth of material.the riaa's legal goose chase chilled these developments long enough to gain headway on its own competing format. if the sdmi specification precludes anything less than a rich range of format-shifting options \u2013 and the ability of anyone to use it and create with it \u2013 the market will kill it dead.either that, or the group may find itself back in court on the receiving end of a bigger supreme court stick called the first amendment.related wired links:music biz builds a time bomb14.may.99mp3 portable hits $100 mark10.may.99mighty rio now a two-way street26.jan.99diamond countersues, defends rio2.dec.1998rio release delayed16.oct.1998"}
