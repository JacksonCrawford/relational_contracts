and all the other drivers - exist only as cascades of calculations, avalanches of computer-generated data that will tumble into kids' dreams.velocity in tight quarters has served lucas as the consummation of desire between men and machines, from the robocops' humming pursuit of robert duvall in thx 1138 to the speeder-bikes tearing like exclamation points through the redwoods in return of the jedi. the pod race delivers the big stand-up-in-your-seat speed orgy in the next chapter of the star wars saga, the phantom menace.for two decades, lucas has been assembling a complex machine of human expertise and silicon firepower in the hills of marin county with one goal: to give filmmakers absolute control of the image, from the moment it's conceived in the screening room of the mind to the night it's shown in a theater. for phantom menace, the first installment of the \"prequel\" trilogy (which takes place a generation before the original films), lucas is returning as a director to marshal that technology into a unified statement of what films and filmmaking will look like in the new century.\"it's like we've been inventing the violin, the piano, the bass,\" industrial light & magic spokesperson miles perkins explains after showing me a reel of jaw-dropping set-pieces from the f/x house's r\u00e9sum\u00e9. \"now it's time to play a symphony.\"all hell breaks loose on the screen. a rank of sleek, amphibious gungan warriors drop to their knees behind translucent shields as a wave of ray bolts showers out of the sky. a second rank of soldiers volleys a fusillade of blue energy bursts at the offscreen battle droids. in the rear, a towering beast of burden surveys the first moments of war, its tail swaying in the cg sunlight.it's over too quickly. i watch it three more times, catching new subtleties with each pass, the individual expressions of fear and determination that flash across the faces of the young warriors as they brace themselves behind their shields.i'm standing at a viewstation at ilm with animation supervisor tom bertino, watching the beginning of the climactic ground battle at the end of the film. after working in lucas's sprawling hive of f/x innovation for 12 years, bertino says that seeing this finished shot - which was created 100 percent digitally - made him \"a golden believer\" that star wars could mean something awesome for a new generation.\"there are any number of ways you can look at this shot and think that it works intellectually,\" he muses, \"but it's not like you're thinking how clever we were about the pacing of the guys going down with their shields, or how the ray bolts were synced into the shields' reactions, or what the feathers on the background cavalrymen were doing. ultimately, it's what your gut says when you're looking at it: 'holy shit!'\"the making of phantom menace brought together a couple of generations of star wars dreamers. bertino was an accomplished cel animator before he adapted his skills for the digital domain. senior visual effects supervisor dennis muren started at ilm as an effects cameraman on the first film. by the time he began work on young sherlock holmes in 1984, he was established as one of the world's most brilliant f/x creators, with a gift for employing colors and choosing camera angles for maximum drama. the computer graphics technicians working on holmes, however, talked in algorithms. so lucas hired a translator.now muren and bertino share a common language with the young animators and programmers at ilm who grew up doing their homework on computers, and directing sequels in their bedrooms starring action figures of darth vader and boba fett.muren came back to star wars after earning academy awards for such films as the abyss, terminator 2, and jurassic park, wondering if there was anything more that he needed to do in the universe of lightsabers, r2-d2, and the dark lords of the sith. \"i asked my 12-year-old son, 'do i really want to do this?'\" he says. \"my son answered, 'of course you're gonna do this.'\"even in the wake of watching a t-rex charge through the brush or a titanic steamship crack in half, there's something singularly majestic about the scene of the young gungans facing off against the battle droids: a chord of epic tragedy that elevates it above the barnyard of martian bugs and cow-levitating tornadoes that scampered after the billion-dollar legacy of the first star wars films.__ \"it's like we've been inventing the violin, piano, and bass. now it's time to play a symphony.\" __the guts of lucas's world-building machine is the rendering farm at ilm, where racks of silicon graphics processors can chew through four terabytes of production data a day. the f/x shots for eight to ten full-length \"shows,\" plus a few commercials, are shuttling through the pipeline at any given time, but menace commanded a full 50 percent of ilm's computing resources for a year. the rendering maw never sleeps. when the animators walk away from their desktop sgis at night or leave them idle, the network cannibalizes their cpu power for the pixel-crunching pool.in 1994, ilm signed what was predictably christened the \"jedi agreement\" with sgi, cofounding a \"joint environment for digital imaging.\" ilm gets to road-test the latest technology, and sgi gets publicity and a lot of useful war stories from one of the most intensive beta-testing labs on earth. \"sgi learns more from us than we do from them,\" brags the young man guiding me through the banks of air-cooled machines.\"should we show him?\" asks greg dunn, ilm's senior hardware administrator. \"show me,\" i plead. i'm taken out the back door, where one server sits by itself with two attachments that look suspiciously like faucets, sporting circuit boards for handles. \"this server,\" dunn explains, \"has been multiply configured for anchor steam and sierra nevada,\" two locally produced brews. the crew once threatened to mail a snapshot of the hollowed-out, six-figure beer server to sgi with the caption, \"this is what happens when you give us something that doesn't work.\"other outdated machines are retired more nobly. the day i dropped by the rendering farm, one of the most illustrious legacy boxes - the kerner power series 4 that crunched the f/x for terminator 2 and the abyss - had just been taken out of action. the weight of ilm's email alone had become too much for it.as much as sgi's processing muscle made the new era of f/x possible, the lucas organization is also finding new ways to press desktop macs and nt boxes into service. rendering hard-surface polygons doesn't require $900,000 worth of hardware, so some of the ships used in the space battles in phantom menace were created on standard consumer boxes with off-the-shelf software. jim morris, president of lucas digital, calls these lower-end rigs ilm's \"second unit.\"home digital video cameras, as well, siphon their datastreams into ilm's protean brew. for the spectacular wide shots of the senate rotunda on coruscant - the bustling gotham of the star wars universe, located at coordinates zero-zero-zero - there was no need to fill each box with a high-resolution creature rendered from scratch. groups of costumed actors were photographed on digital video, replicated, and numbered, then a script stitched each actor into his or her place in the tableau.one of the most innovative uses of ilm's second unit in the making of menace was the extensive use of previsualization software, aka \"animatics,\" to create dynamic 3-d storyboards of each sequence before it was rendered at ilm or shot on film.three years ago, david dozoretz began working with lucas to flesh out his script in low-cost digital form. it wasn't the first time dozoretz had used the technique. for the final chase sequence in mission: impossible, he created cg previsualizations using scanned-in action figures with photoshop cocreator john knoll, one of the f/x supervisors for phantom menace. (the speeder-bike sequence in return of the jedi was previsualized by muren on film, using star wars action figures.) when producer rick mccallum saw the animatics for mission: impossible, he tapped dozoretz to create them for the pod race. the previsualization proved so useful, dozoretz and his team ended up making an average of four to six animatics versions of every f/x shot in the film, using software like electric image and commotion, written by ilm's scott squires, a program similar to photoshop that allows painting of multiple frames.animatics was originally intended to be a quick and dirty time-saving tool for roughing out basic forms for blocking and composition with no textures or shadows. as dozoretz began sketching out the pod race, however, he found himself adding more bells and whistles. \"the way you communicate speed is with detail, which means textures, and spatial relationships, which means shadows and motion blur,\" he recalls. \"we almost instantly ended up breaking all the rules that we laid down.\"as filming began in england, animatics and dailies were swapped over an encrypted isdn connection, further blurring the lines between preproduction and principal photography. the animatics themselves became a mixed-media collage of scanned-in storyboard fragments, cg graphics, motion capture data, and live action (the son of sound designer ben burtt played anakin in the low-res rendition of the pod race). basically, the animatics crew ended up crafting a high-quality videogame version of phantom menace that could be tweaked on a laptop.dozoretz believes that the ability to visualize sequences quickly and at low cost freed up lucas to invent alternate ways of telling the story, knock them out in animatics, and choose the best ones. \"it's analogous to what's happening to filmmaking,\" dozoretz observes. \"it becomes less of a photographic medium, where you're stuck with what you get in the lens, and more of a painterly medium, where you're deciding where to put things.\"__ \"it's not even like george thinks about it - it just comes out of him. he can create vast worlds, then go down to the minutiae on everything.\" __consider c-3po, who is still a work-in-progress throughout phantom menace. to film shots of light shining through gaps in his unfinished body, the dandified droid was played by a life-size model manipulated from behind by a puppeteer. dozoretz erased the puppeteer from the background using his g3 powerbook, while sitting on a balcony in hawaii.despite all of the bit-crunching that went into the making of menace, however, the ornate worlds of anakin skywalker, queen amidala, and the lanky gungan called jar jar binks look hand-crafted, rather than computer generated. the archways of theed and the shimmering, frank lloyd wright-influenced towers of coruscant share more of an aesthetic with the turn-of-the-century grandfather clock that stands in the hallway of the main house at skywalker ranch than with the future of industrial design. phantom menace is the highest-resolution image of a man's imagination in history.jean cocteau wrote in the journal he kept while making beauty and the beast that the essence of a filmmaker's calling is to \"reorganize chance.\"by scanning phantom menace into digital form and using cut-and-paste compositing tools to move elements around within frames, lucas has taken control of chance in a way that earlier directors could have barely imagined. ilm's scott squires says that lucas first fully grasped the possibilities of digital filmmaking in 1992, working with low-cost video effects for the tightly budgeted tv series the young indiana jones chronicles. phantom menace is lucas's statement that such fluidity is now available for directors of even epic feature films. \"the actor glances this way and then that. the director says, 'i don't like that.' so you remove the glance,\" squires says. \"we're getting closer and closer to the point where writers and directors are basically wide open in what they can put on the screen. we tell directors, 'just assume it's all there for real. how would you shoot it, and what would you want to accomplish on the screen?'\"mark hamill once remarked, \"i have a sneaking suspicion that if there were a way to make movies without actors, george would do it.\" he's close now. on the digital backlot, acting is a distributed quantity, parceled out among artists, cg animators, voice talent, motion capture technicians, sound designers, and others. the primary actor becomes the filmmaker's imagination.at the center of the giant mandala of machines and artists that lucas has created, his native storyteller's ability to make up characters, histories, and complex webs of relationship off the top of his head provides the metadata that organizes the swirl of activity around him.phantom menace concept designer doug chiang remembers the moment he discovered that the reinvented star wars universe would include a new kind of weapon: \"one day we were storyboarding, and george said, 'darth maul pulls out a double-edged lightsaber.' i said, 'really? cool.'\"lucas's fictions have the felicitous effect of inspiring others to weave their own stories around them. in the summer of 1977, i saw star wars with allen ginsberg. these days, we might say that the elder poet played a reluctant yoda in my teenage quest for jedi knighthood, but those metaphors weren't yet part of earth's atmosphere. we sat in an air-conditioned theater in boulder, colorado, as the words crawled up the screen: a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ...the hairy-eared sage of the rebel forces from the lower east side sighed, \"thank god - i don't have to worry about it!\"that's the storyteller's gift to those who breathe life into the phantoms in his head by believing in them.__ lucas at midlife is more comfortable with a morally ambiguous world, and the palette of his imagination reflects that. __have a look at stephen j. sansweet's star wars encyclopedia, a compendium of the saga's first cycle, with enough critters to deep-six a fleet of noah's arks - elaborate civilizations that only lurked in the wings of the movies, but took center stage in the scores of authorized novels, comic books, and cd-roms that used the films as their point of departure. (\"though the durkii is normally a docile beast, it can become a raging monster due to the discomfort caused by kleex infestation.\")surprisingly, says animation director rob coleman, there was no printed bible of deep background provided to the animators who articulated the movements and mannerisms of characters like jar jar and watto, the potbellied junk peddler who utters one of the film's indelible catchphrases. to develop the personalities of these characters, the animators would ask each other questions a director might put to an actor getting into a role: what are watto's favorite foods? has he ever seen a jedi before? then, as coleman sat beside lucas in england during filming, the two of them riffed for hours while shots were set up and broken down. (lucas has worked in england for years because he likes the british crews, and there's an old airplane factory at leavesden studios so vast he can put nine stages under one roof.)\"with george, it's not just, 'let's build a building with an arch in the middle of it,'\" coleman explains. \"inside each of those worlds, it's like a mandelbrot. you think you're going to get to the bottom detail, but then george will tell you about the propulsion system on the submarine that you see in only four shots, and the symbiotic relationships the gungans have with their aquatic friends. it's not even like he thinks about it - it just comes out of him. he can create vast worlds, and then go down to the minutiae on everything. that's why he could tell me whether jar jar would look at something or not.\" coleman would bear this information back to his team of animators, whose collective effort gave birth to the \"actors\" behind the photorealistic surfaces designed in the machines.the animators ended up wrestling with all sorts of actorly difficulties, such as how to avoid cg portrayals that depend on exaggerated, iconic actions, the overbroad mannerisms of silent-film acting and vaudeville. yet even drawing a bead on a character's core - the demeanor of watto, says coleman, was based on alec guinness's fagin in oliver twist - is not enough.one of the hardest things about making leading cg characters look real is getting them to do nothing convincingly. when jar jar was speaking or moving around, you bought it, coleman says, but when the gangling saurian had no bit of business to perform, or was supposed to be merely thinking, he at first looked awkward. to remedy this, coleman studied how actors like laurence olivier and jimmy stewart communicated presence and attention between their lines:\"what did stewart do when he was listening to grace kelly in rear window? what was going over his face? what were the muscles in his mouth doing? what were his eyebrows doing? as soon as i focused my animators on this, the characters came to life.\"the distinctive thumbprint of life is all over the synthetic landscapes and faces of the phantom menace. the creatures of naboo, tatooine, and coruscant designed by terryl whitlatch are informed by a zoologist's knowledge of how a hipbone would connect to a thighbone in ecosystems dominated by water or sand. the lines of the neimoidian battle ships raise hackles by echoing the forms of threatening animals. even queen amidala's jewelry has dna in its heritage, inspired by art nouveau baubles that were themselves fashioned after twining tendrils and leaves.doug chiang nailed the job as the film's concept designer when he submitted some of his own personal portfolio along with sketches derived from ralph mcquarrie's original conceptions for the first trilogy. in that batch of designs were drawings that melded hardware with forms inspired by wildlife painters like robert bateman and raymond harris-ching: machines that were half alive, such as the gungan submarine propelled by squid-like tentacles, which appears in the film.phantom menace's most dazzling invention - the gungans' underwater metropolis - would have been impossible to bring to the screen without technology. yet it could just as easily have grown organically where the jedi first swim into it, a city of incandescent bubbles suspended in vines that look like they sprouted from the floor of the ocean of naboo.in the original star wars trilogy, the visual lexicon of life, with its muted colors and rounded, irregular shapes, was allotted mostly to the good guys. leia organa in her honeybun do, fuzzy yoda in his swamp, and ewoks hosting hippie hoedowns in the trees, versus the emperor's bureaucrats and hit-men, goose-stepping through an angular world of black and white.lucas at midlife is more comfortable with presenting a morally complicated world, and the palette of his imagination reflects that. for the first chapter of the saga of anakin skywalker's fall and eventual redemption - the story of a boy who grew up to be a machine called darth vader, and at last became a man again - the relationships between good and evil are more complex, and so is the division of forms.the director has reached a rung of mastery where the organic and the technological are equally responsive to the force of his imagination. as our computers learn to speak and see, and the tiny labors of our anatomy are outsourced to machines, those distinctions are blurring on both sides of the movie screen.what has remained constant is lucas's commitment to presenting a seamlessly realized fantasy given weight by the particulars of human error. in the world of his imagination, people don't always hit the target; they spill coffee on the robots, may take years to recognize their own father, and have to discipline themselves to avoid the pitfalls of despair and greed. the streaks of fuel running down from the gas-caps of the battle droids do as much to bring his vision alive in our minds as a roomful of sgis.it's our world, but elsewhere."}
