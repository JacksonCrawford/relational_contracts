yahoo has a similar arrangement with liquid audio.in the technology arena, yahoo swallowed up broadcast.com and now offers users an interactive player with thomas dolby's beatnik engine, both of which are promoted on the yahoo digital site. despite this musical array, michael latham, director of entertainment media at yahoo, said his is taking a cautious approach.\"we have a different point of view [than other portals],\" latham said. \"lycos does a net search, but we don\u2019t want to present potentially illegal files. aol has made software investments. our concern is [investing in] an eight-track player or betamax. it's too early to tell. right now it's about interactivity and a good consumer experience.\"amazon spokesman greg hart said that getting into online retail is a big step for both the traditional music outlets and the portals. \"a portal or a record label frankly doesn\u2019t have that [marketing expertise],\" he said. \"we have relationships with most of the major portals, and companies like yahoo are not geared to the physical sales of goods.\"currently, cdnow and amazon dominate cd sales over the internet. but with the inevitable shift to online distribution, portals may find themselves in a sweet spot for downloadable music sales. whatever the case, traditional retailers like tower have a lot of work to do.\"aol has made some serious moves in this space and is in a great position to sell because their users are already accustomed to paying bills to them. it would be easy to integrate music downloads into that model,\" jupiter communications analyst aram sinnreich said.another advantage that portals may have over labels and their distributors is that to remain competitive, they will also have to remain neutral. by contrast, the labels and their distributors have traditionally created channels only for their own music.\"getmusic.com, bmg, and universal have a vested interest in promoting their own content first, which may not be what the consumer wants,\" sinnreich said. \"consumers don't have allegiance to a label, but they do to artists. so there are implicit hurdles for music content providers in the retail arena.\"soon enough, the battle for online music will not be so much an issue of the best technology for the job, but who can offer the most attractive package. in the case of record labels, that could mean giving away special bonus tracks or other incentives to customers who buy directly from their distribution chain.when asked where people will go to buy music online, emusic vice president steve grady said, \"music consumers will be in all these places [music sites, portals, labels, and retailers], and we just want our music to be one click away ... so where will people go? everywhere.\""}
