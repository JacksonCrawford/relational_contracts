(why not use apple's quicktime vr for all of this instead? for starters, you might need special turntable equipment to rotate and photograph objects.)sometimes the edges of a completed model look a little funky, so canoma lets you retouch surfaces using 2-d imaging software. i couldn't check out this feature - canoma is such a memory pig (48-plus megs recommended) that ididn't have enough ram left to run photoshop. luckily, most of my results looked fine.like other metacreations products (kai's power tools, bryce, kai's photo soap, goo), canoma has an otherworldly user interface that's an enjoyable departure from typical mac and windows apps. not many people will buy the $499 canoma as a toy, as they would goo. but the software wasn't made with the masses in mind - it's for hard-goods retailers, real estate companies, and travel agencies that want to deliver a compelling buying experience. but if you've got the bucks to burn and want to show off your swank pad or collection of medieval humour-drainage implements to homepage visitors, canoma will really wow 'em.canoma: $499. metacreations: (800) 846 0111, street credcelebrating edificepop-up pixoriginal quirkceos get wiseyour assistant's assistantdilbert killerinternet on line onereadmemusicpower slidesay anything - anywherefood from thoughtunsung heroesjust outta betasaving private ivantrue dial-tone computingcontributors"}
