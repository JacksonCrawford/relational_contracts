(see \"ethernet at 60,000 feet,\" wired 7.06, page 150.) aerovironment, the firm that created pathfinder-plus, hopes to reach 100,000 feet with its successor, centurion, by 2001.calvin's team had suggested exploring with gliders, which can go a long way on mars and, lacking engines, can carry a larger scientific payload. there's just one problem: the wright brothers' place in history came from more than gliding, and nasa has specified that the craft must be powered.calvin's group and the people at ames are not the only scientists with grand plans. nasa has yet to make its final decisions on the specifics of the mission, allowing for other researchers to bid on parts of the project. by the time all bids are in - probably late this summer - there may be enough blue-sky ideas to send a whole squadron to the red planet.must readsputterniktired/wiredgood dealas the well turnsall's well that ends wellsmarter bombbattlefield of tomorrowpass it onfashion policewhy buy retail?paranoia technologytailor-made medspeoplejargon watchpersonality typingcustomize or diesailing the red skiesgrubstake grillt1, good buddyraw data"}
