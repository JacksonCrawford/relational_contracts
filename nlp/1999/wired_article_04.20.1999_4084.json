let's all just accept it, folks: the net's here to stay, and practically all companies will do at least a portion of their business online.in telecom, bellsouth (bls) eased 25 cents to $41.63 even as record sales boosted its first-quarter profit to 46 cents a share, a penny more than anticipated. but this amount doesn't include a $280 million hit that resulted from brazil devaluing its currency, which would place bellsouth's income more in the 32-cents-a-share range. traders also are still digesting word that the company will shell out billions for a 10 percent stake in qwest communications international.for its part, sprint (fon) advanced $3 to $100.44 as it reported quarterly earnings of 93 cents a diluted share, 3 cents ahead of estimates. the company credited its success to an increase in both wireless and long-distance customers.worth watching: the planet's biggest (to date) merger is being negotiated over in europe, where deutsche telekom is looking to get hitched to telecom italia in a deal worth more than $94 billion. if it goes through, it's entirely possible that the merged entity then would make a play for sprint, which already is partnered with deutsche telekom in the global one joint venture.a rough day for monsanto (mtc). the biotech gained 88 cents to $43 even as its new arthritis drug celebrex was linked to 10 deaths and nearly a dozen cases of gastrointestinal hemorrhages, according to a report in the wall street journal. the drug is one of a new breed called cox-2 inhibitors, which are touted as an effective way to ease pain without the side-effects of aspirin and its kin.lastly, and speaking of painkillers, ben & jerry's homemade (bjica) surged 17 percent to $29.75 as the maker of magnificently bad-for-you treats crushed expectations with quarterly income of 16 cents a share. not only did ben & jerry's introduce southern pecan pie ice cream during the last three months, but also unveiled its s'mores -- chocolate ice cream bars with marshmallow, graham cracker and a chocolate coating.now there's an e-commerce prospect that market cap likes, if only one could iron out the delivery question."}
