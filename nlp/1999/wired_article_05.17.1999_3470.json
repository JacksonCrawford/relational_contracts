most attention. earlier, traders had fretted about the fed indicating a \"bias\" toward jacking up interest rates when greenspan & co. meet on tuesday. nobody expects rates to go up this time, but recent signs of strength in the us economy have just about everyone figuring mr. g will signal a tightening of monetary policy down the road.by late afternoon, investors apparently decided they would worry about this when it comes.after being down in the morning more than 160 points, the dow jones industrial average ultimately fell 59.85 to close at 10853.47. the wired index rose 6.38 to 651.48, and the nasdaq composite index was 33.98 higher at 2561.84. the s&p 500 was up 1.69 at 1339.49.\"the pressures that led the fed to ease rates three times before are no longer there,\" said bill meehan, chief market analyst at cantor fitzgerald. \"even if it's not yet official, there's been a change in the bias. the next move will be to tighten.\"while most stats suggest that inflation has kept its distance as the economy chugs along, consumer prices took a surprisingly big jump last month, largely due to sky-high fuel costs. news of the increase knocked financial markets for a loop on friday, and the skittishness has persisted right through the weekend.meehan thinks the latest consumer-price numbers show that \"the best of the inflation news is behind us -- not that there's going to be any extraordinary rampage of inflation.\" he expects \"a more ordinary environment\" to return, in which red-hot economic growth is accompanied by a greater risk of price increases.and that in turn would mean greenspan and his posse would keep interest rates on a tighter leash.in merger action, us west unveiled a complicated deal with upstart network operator global crossing valued at more than us$37 billion. while the tie-up keeps both companies on the playing field amid intense industry consolidation, investors weren't sure what to make of all the fine print, which includes separate stocks for the combined company's internet and long-distance services, not to mention a $600 million \"break-up fee\" if either side gets cold feet before the marriage is consummated.us west (usw) dropped $4.25 to $58, and global crossing (gblx) was $1.19 lower at $60.19. on the other hand, qwest communications international (qwst), which reportedly made its own rebuffed advance at us west, rose $6.13 to $90.88.meantime, general dynamics (gd) tumbled $6.31 to $65.13 after saying it will purchase gulfstream aerospace for $5.3 billion. the move is quite a departure for general dynamics, which takes in nearly all its revenue from defense contracts, including production of the f-16 jet fighter. the company is clearly hoping that a leap into the business-jet sector will provide a convenient hedge in the unlikely event that world peace breaks out.\"gulfstream is a perfect fit,\" insisted general dynamics' ceo, nicholas chabraja, not very convincingly. gulfstream (gac) shareholders saw the buyout as a sweet deal, and the firm's stock flew 11 percent to $61.75.in a considerably smaller transaction, life insurer life usa holding (lusa) surged 89 percent to $19.38 on word that it would be acquired by allianz life insurance for $540 million. allianz is a subsidiary of allianz ag, one of europe's biggest insurance firms.on the tech front, hewlett-packard (hwp) rose $1.94 to $86.13 amid hopes the company would beat expectations when it posted its quarterly earnings after the closing bell. profit of 80 cents a share was expected. and dell computer (dell) was up $1.94 at $43.13 as merrill lynch looked ahead to upbeat results when the pc maker opens its books on tuesday.netwise, amazon.com (amzn) climbed $5.25 to $137.63 as it came up with a clever new way to avoid making money: selling bestsellers for just half the cover price. not enjoying the same no-profit business model, barnes & noble (bks) declined $1.13 to $33.19 as its barnesandnoble.com matched amazon's discounts.amr (amr), parent of american airlines, slipped 88 cents to $70.19 even as it reached a tentative accord with its flight attendants' union following nine months of contract negotiations. the talks were considerably less prickly than american's face-down with pilots, who staged a sick-out to press their demands for more pay and benefits. the carrier's pact with flight attendants is expected to be approved next month.keebler foods (kbl), the second-biggest us cookie maker, rose 63 cents to $32.50 after announcing a crash diet. the company said it would close down a new jersey bakery to reduce excess capacity, and that the move would result in a one-time charge of $69 million.lastly, it's our old pal k-tel international (ktel) falling 59 cents to $7.44 as it posted a widening quarterly loss of 50 cents a share. the company blamed much of the setback on heavy outlays to beef up its web offerings.among those offerings, market cap is pleased to discover, are replays of old k-tel commercials from the '70s. the company may be losing money, but this column thinks it's cash well spent when people can revisit the likes of the kitchen magician (\"it's the world's fastest cole-slaw maker!\")."}
