"perhaps it was the giant image of the taco bell chihuahua launching the national broadcaster's association convention with a lip-synced \"yo quiero nab.\" maybe it was ted turner's speech on how it felt to make and lose a billion dollars in a single week.or possibly it was the panel discussion in which yahoo and nbc executives debated the e-commerce potential of jennifer anniston's dress.whatever it was, the annual convention on the future of broadcasting conveyed with crystal clarity how pervasive the medium already is -- and how frighteningly pervasive it will be.a few of the highlights, live from las vegas:. . .a panel discussion on broadcasting in the 21st century digressed into a debate over whether the nbc hit \"friends\" could use an interactive twist.executives from nbc, yahoo, echostar communications, and at&t considered whether viewers -- given the opportunity -- would actually want to buy the props they see on popular television shows.the concept: buy the same wardrobe as your favorite character by mouse-clicking on their clothes while you watch tv. then just type in your credit card number and get the goods delivered.panelists agreed that this particular e-commerce possibility seemed somewhat appalling.\"i don't know if there's a lot of people who will want to buy jennifer anniston's dress,\" said yahoo's jerry yang.the interactive television business needs to take some slightly terrifying turns before that sort of selling becomes a reality, said tom rodgers, nbc's president of cable and business development.\"what i think is going to happen is microsoft is going to have to acquire christmas,\" rodgers said. just think of the e-commerce possibilities there.. . .dozens of tech companies set up make-believe talk shows to entice hordes of conference attendees to sit through their product pitches. play, which unveiled its globecaster \"studio in a box\" kit for web broadcasting, had one of the livelier discussions.company co-founder kiki stockhammer, clad in a skintight red mini-dress, told a studio audience how even the owner of a \"crappy computer\" can become a web broadcaster with a few thousand dollars of investment. she also talked about the company work envirnoment.\"we literally run around at play with rocket boosters shoved up our butts,\" stockhammer said, explaining how the company comes up with its innovative products. a co-host quickly corrected her: \"i've done a survey. it turns out only three play employees have rocket boosters shoved up their butts,\" he said.. . .ted turner told broadcasters what their real problem is: too many channels.as broadcasters move from analog to digital technology, they'll have enough spectrum left over to add on a bunch of new channels. that could be a bad thing, turner said, since they'll have to find a way to use the extra space.\"where's the programming coming for 40 new stations in your market?\" the cable mogul said.turner also rambled a bit about his personal experience in the turbulent market for media stocks. just recently, in a single week his stock worth went up by a billion dollars and crashed back down.\"it was fun making it, and it was miserable losing it,\" turner said.. . .no industry convention is complete without politics. this year, the broadcast association's chief boogeymen included satellite companies and a government proposal to open up radio airwaves to small broadcasters.nab president edward fritts blasted a proposal by the federal communications commission to promote so-called microradio. the fcc says it wants to let schools, churches, and non-profit groups get their own low-power radio stations. but nab members said the proposal could mess up fm broadcasting for established stations.\"we're very concerned that the fcc proposal may have the effect of legitimizing pirates,\" said fritts said.the nab also wants congress to keep broadcasters in mind when it debates the satellite home viewer act, which regulates what channels satellite companies can beam to customers. the association says satellite companies shouldn't be allowed to bypass local tv stations by broadcasting network channels from far-away cities.\"satellite companies may operate above the earth, but they do not operate above the law,\" fritts said.. . .political agendas aside, broadcasters took some time to congratulate themselves for their unsurpassed reach into american homes.sure, there's the fear about competition from the net. but there has also been paranoia about competition from cable, satellite television, and all kinds of new technologies seen as threats to big broadcasters, said keynote speaker sony corporation of america chairman howard stringer, in a keynote speech.so far, nothing has killed network television, said stringer, who quoted fox's the simpsons in his closing remarks.\"as bart simpson once said reproachfully to homer: 'tv has done more to raise me than you have.'\""}
