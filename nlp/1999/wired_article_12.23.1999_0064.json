yet set a timetable for achieving this goal, but said it is expected to take several years.as the fast-food chain marked the 10th anniversary of its landmark alliance with the environmental defense fund, the partners reviewed their accomplishments of the past decade and announced future plans to build a greener mcdonald\u2019s.ten years ago, with \"a controversial foam container and a handshake,\" the edf and mcdonald\u2019s agreed to work together to reduce the chain\u2019s use of energy and environmentally unsafe materials, like its infamous polystyrene foam hamburger box.since then, the partnership has introduced paper wraps, lightweight recycled boxes, and unbleached paper carry-out bags, and made dozens of other packaging improvements behind the counter in mcdonald's restaurants and throughout the company's supply chain.at a press conference this week, edf and mcdonald\u2019s said they will continue to \"raise the bar\" on these initiatives, and set a new goal to further reduce energy use, packaging and restaurant waste. mcdonald\u2019s announced a goal of reducing restaurant energy use by 10 percent, and said such a reduction would save its 12,500 restaurants between us$3,000 and $4,000 a year in energy costs.\"it's going to be a several years' process. it's not something you can do in months,\" said jack greenberg, mcdonald's chairman and chief executive officer. \"but the goal is an important one and the benefits to the environment and mcdonald's system are significant.\"many improvements will have to wait until older mcdonald\u2019s restaurants get remodeled or rebuilt, but new restaurants will be built with energy reduction in mind.while participation in the energy efficiency initiative will be voluntary for the company\u2019s franchisees, which own about 85 percent of the company's us restaurants, most are expected to embrace the project, as they have embraced other energy saving measures in the past.\"we don't think it's going to be a hard sell,\" said greenberg. over the past 10 years, mcdonald\u2019s has installed energy efficient lights in its restaurants, saving more than 510 million kilowatt hours of electricity -- and about 4,000 tons of greenhouse gases. at five state-of-the-art, energy-efficient mcdonald\u2019s restaurants in the united states, the company is already achieving a 10- to 15-percent reduction in overall energy use.in bensenville, illinois, the company runs a model mcdonald\u2019s where new energy reducing technologies can be tested before they are introduced in other restaurants.the bensenville restaurant conserves energy through high-efficiency air conditioning units, automatic lights, water valves, and hand dryers. there are also skylights, which reduces the need for indoor lighting. a 75-kilowatt, natural gas fueled turbogenerator provided by unicom energy services and alliedsignal helps power the restaurant.\"mcdonald's new efforts to reduce energy use, along with its ongoing efforts to reduce packaging and restaurant waste, are gratifying because they demonstrate that edf helped put in place a new environmental ethic that led to continued environmental improvements,\" said fred krupp, the edf's executive director.over the past decade, mcdonald\u2019s has eliminated 150,000 tons of mcdonald's packaging by redesigning or reducing the amount of material used to make straws, napkins, sandwich packaging, cups, french fry containers, and numerous other items.the company has also purchased more than $3 billion worth of products made from recycled materials for use in the operation and construction of mcdonald's restaurants. these include construction blocks, booster seats, tables, trays, roof tiles, bags, and many other quality products made from recycled glass, rubber, plastic, and paper.more than 1 million tons of corrugated cardboard, the most commonly used material for shipping products to mcdonald's restaurants in the united states, have been recycled, decreasing restaurant waste by 30 percent.other fast-food restaurants are following suit.burger king, the nation's fourth-largest fast-food chain, has a four point program aimed at reducing waste and conserving energy. burger king only uses plastic foam free of environmentally harmful chlorofluorocarbons in its coffee cups.instead of foam boxes, burger king uses plastic wraps for its hamburgers, and has since 1991. in the wake of the success of the edf-mcdonald\u2019s partnership, edf and the pew charitable trusts launched the alliance for environmental innovation, which has institutionalized this cooperative model and engaged a number of other leading us businesses to undertake a range of environmental initiatives. among the alliance's partners have been sc johnson, united parcel service, starbucks, dell computer, and clairol.\"the cooperative approach pioneered by the environmental defense fund and mcdonald's laid the foundation for an entirely new approach to solving environmental problems,\" said richard vietor, who is a professor of environmental management at harvard business school. \"their landmark project showed both business and environmental activists that sometimes they can share the path toward a more sustainable society.\"\"when we launched our alliance 10 years ago, i don\u2019t believe either one of us could have imagined the scope of the results we are announcing today,\" said greenberg. \"working with edf, mcdonald\u2019s is proud of the tangible difference we have made for the environment in just 10 years. as we head into the new century, mcdonald\u2019s will continue to set new, ambitious targets for environmental progress.\"copyright environment news service (ens) 1999for full text and graphics visit:
