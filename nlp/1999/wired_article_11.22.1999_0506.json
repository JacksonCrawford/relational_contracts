published friday by the department of trade and industry. the shortened bill has been welcomed by a majority of the industry, and is now expected to pass easily when it is debated in parliament early next year. however, critics of the new bill pointed out that the debated proposals are far from dead.instead, part iii, which housed most of the controversial proposals, has been spun off into the new \"regulation of investigatory powers bill\" (rip). the uk's home office will now handle the separate bill.caspar bowden, director of the foundation for information policy research, an internet policy think tank, said the spinoff was merely a way for the department of trade and industry to quickly push through the long-awaited electronic communications bill. the bill has been touted as the government's commitment to helping turn the uk into one of the world's strongest internet economies.\"patricia hewitt [the uk's e-minister] must be congratulated for performing a skillful political amputation to save british e-commerce,\" said bowden.in one of the most praised sections of the new bill, electronic signatures are set to become as legally binding as handwritten ones. supporters say the acceptance of electronic signatures will speed up transactions and facilitate e-commerce.but bowden pointed out that a rule in part ii of the bill could still allow victims, whose electronic signatures have been forged, to be held responsible for them. \"consumers will not have confidence in electronic signatures if they risk being made liable for forged signatures, and there needs to be a clear rule to prevent this,\" bowden said.meanwhile, the proposed rip bill has its own problems. specifically, the bill would update the interception of communications act, regulate covert surveillance and use of informers, and provide powers to decrypt coded e-mail.bowden is particularly perturbed that proposals on the decryption of email are still unclear. previously, the government proposed that the failure to obey a decryption notice be made into a criminal offense. under the proposal, individuals would have to prove first they did not have access to the keys.or, as bowden pointed out, that they were guilty until proven innocent. the home office said, however, that even though an individual had to cough up the keys, the authorities would still have to prove that an offense had been committed for a prosecution to get off the ground. but bowden remained skeptical. \"the home office [statement] avoids the burden-of-proof issue with ambiguous wording. this may indicate either the policy is in play, or that the new rip bill will turn out to be window-dressing,\" he said.the home office and the dti are planning to push both the new electronic communications bill and the rip bill through parliament at the same time. bowden feared that it was not enough time for the rip bill to be publicly debated.the conservative party in the past has also condemened the decryption proposals in the draft bill. the party's office, however, could not be reached for comment, as it is embroiled in a scandal that has bumped the e-communications bills off its current agenda.on saturday, jeffrey archer, novelist and tory candidate for london mayor, pulled out of the race amid allegations that he had asked his friend, ted francis, to perjure himself at a libel trial.twelve years ago, archer successfully sued the daily star, for an article that accused archer of having slept with a prostitute. archer was found out after francis sold his story to another tabloid, news of the world, for \u00a314,000.the uk's liberal democratic party has also voiced concern with the home office's handling of the bill. \"we were very much opposed to part iii of the draft bill,\" said sally mcleod, senior trade and industry researcher of the liberal democrats. \"it's good that it's come out, but we are still concerned it will reappear someplace else.\"bowden also feared the rip bill would be lost in the home office shuffle. bowden said the home office was presenting \"a whole raft of bills\" that were more \"socially prominent.\" other home office bills that will be presented at the same time will tackle such issues as mandatory drug testing in police stations and the restriction of trial by jury for some defendants.\"the rip bill is going to be one of many bills,\" said bowden. \"i fear that not many people will pay attention to it as it is a more 'techie' bill.\"the home office, meanwhile, said it was simply trying to strike a balance between its obligations for the \"protection of society at large,\" and its \"obligations under the european convention of human rights.\"there's no biz like e-bizthere's no biz like e-biz"}
