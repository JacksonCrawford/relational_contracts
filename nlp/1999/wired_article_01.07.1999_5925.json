and as an influential analyst hinted that perhaps the market had climbed a little too high for its own good. don't tell that to runaway internet shares, however. they're already tugging at their ropes and pushing forward.the dow jones industrial average shed 7.21 points to close at 9537.76, and the s&p 500 was 2.60 lower at 1269.74. but the nasdaq composite index rose 5.33 to 2326.19, and the wired index was up 3.16 at 617.50.while it comes as no surprise that a number of investors would look to pocket their winnings after the dow blasted through the 9500 barrier, few were expecting goldman sachs' abby joseph cohen, queen of the bulls, to come out with a recommendation that traders lower the percentage of stocks in their portfolios to 70 percent from 72 percent.the change may seem minor on the face of it, but it was interpreted as a sign that cohen views current valuations as being a bit too rich even for her blood. and seeing as cohen was one of the few to accurately call the market's rebound last year, she has some big-time street cred.meanwhile, the bidding war for airtouch communications (ati), the leading us wireless phone service, ratcheted up a notch as usa today and bloomberg reported that mci worldcom (wcom) is about to weigh in with an offer surpassing the us$55 billion on the table from britain's vodafone group (vod). if so, it's entirely possible that the sale price could top $60 billion -- a good deal more than the $40 billion paid when mci and worldcom joined forces.\"every telephone company is trying to become a full-service provider for their customers,\" said philip sirlin, an analyst with schroder wertheim & co. \"it's absolutely clear that having a wireless service is indispensable for a nationwide company.\"for this reason, he expects mci, if the company indeed enters the fray, to prevail against rival suitors vodafone and bell atlantic (bel). \"mci could build the physical facilities of airtouch for a small fraction of $50 billion,\" sirlin observed. \"but they couldn't do it instantly, and they wouldn't have an existing customer base.\"what's more, whoever walks away with airtouch's assets also gains possession of highly valuable licenses for wireless operations in the united states and overseas. \"if mci lets this slip away,\" sirlin said, \"it's not clear how they'll get into the wireless business.\"be that as it may, investors were unsure that forking out mega-bucks for airtouch is in mci's best interest. the long-distance carrier's stock fell $3.31 to $75.06, while vodafone was down $3.94 at $176.81. bell atlantic, with just $43 billion offered, gained 6 cents to $55.94, perhaps because traders figure it's now off the hook for such a huge purchase.airtouch, the belle of the ball, climbed $2.06 to $81.94. nice to be popular, huh?qwest communications international (qwst) is another telco on the go, rising $3.25 to $55 on word that it remains on track to complete its 18,500-mile fiber-optic network by this summer. the company said it already has completed construction of 12,500 miles, plus 17,000 miles of pipeline in which to run its cables.on the internet front, network solutions (nsol) catapulted $44.50, or 26 percent, to $216.50 as prudential securities raised its rating for the company's stock to \"strong buy\" from \"accumulate.\" although network solutions is on the verge of losing its lucrative monopoly on web-address registrations, the firm's shares have more than tripled in the last few weeks following marketing deals with netscape communications and yahoo, and announcement of a two-for-one stock split.speaking of bedfellows, lycos (lcos) advanced $5.50 to $71.50 after saying it had formed a marketing tie-up with international business machines. separately, lycos said it will introduce a bunch of new features over the next few months, including online communities and auctions. the company is now in the process of acquiring wired news.in-flight catalog retailer skymall (skym) bolstered the belief that anything .com can't be bad. the company's shares surged $7.63, or 43 percent, to $25.25 after it formed a subsidiary -- named, yup, skymall.com -- to oversee its burgeoning online sales. amazon.com (amzn), meantime, jumped $20.88, or 15 percent, to $158.88, and yahoo (yhoo) was up $29 at $320.in tech, apple computer (aapl) advanced $3.25 to $45 as cs first boston raised its rating for the firm's stock to \"buy\" from \"hold.\" for its part, dell computer (dell) rose 6 cents to $78.19, and ibm (ibm) was $1.44 higher at $190.19.cisco systems (csco) gained $3.88 to $103.63 as it unveiled a new cable modem as part of efforts to reposition itself as a consumer-friendly outfit. and adaptec (adpt), a maker of under-the-hood computer gear, accelerated $5.31, or 27 percent, to $24.88 after saying it will report better-than-expected profit for its fiscal third quarter, well ahead of the 14 cents a share anticipated by analysts.some solid earnings as well in finance. morgan stanley dean witter (mwd) rose $3.56 to $84.25 after posting quarterly profit of $1.49 a share, handily whipping the 96 cents expected by the street. and lehman brothers holdings (leh) was up 50 cents at $54.13 as it reported quarterly net income of 51 cents a share, more than twice the expected amount.on the other hand, borders group (bgp) tumbled $5.06, or 20 percent, to $20 after the bookseller warned it won't meet earnings estimates for the quarter ending 31 january. the company blamed unusually icy winter weather for keeping shoppers at home. it's probably also regretting its decision not to follow rival barnes & noble into the weatherproof world of electronic retailing.lastly, time warner (twx) slid $2.06 to $60.94 after its warner bros. division said it plans to invest heavily in giving the studio a bigger online presence, including creation of a portal to rival recent efforts by disney. if it works for mickey mouse, these guys are obviously thinking, then it'll work for bugs bunny.a wascally plan."}
