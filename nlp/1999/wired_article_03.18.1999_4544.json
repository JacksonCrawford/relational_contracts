[now] they're just disappearing as a company.\"such predictions of doom are way off the mark, say netscape insiders and other observers.jim hamerly, vice president of netscape's client products division, say the doomsayers are dead wrong and completely ignorant of america online's stated intentions.\"mozilla, gecko, and all the technologies that it represents are core technologies that are vital, not only to us, but to aol as well,\" hamerly said \"aol has openly supported mozilla and our open source initiative.\"in the days after america online announced plans to buy netscape, aol proclaimed its support for the development of the browser and the mozilla project. but it did so only after mozilla project leader jamie zawinski posted a letter to the mozilla community.aol chairman steve case called netscape's software engineers an experienced development team with the ability to innovate rapidly. \"we are committed to maintaining continuity at netscape,\" case said at the time.there's no question that aol is a wildcard, said forrester research analyst paul hagen. \"[but] i'm starting to see a little bit of joint development and cross-fertilization [between aol and its netscape subsidiary].\"whatever aol ends up doing with the software, the company has changed course on what it plans to achieve in netscape's next release. that achievement will depend heavily on a component that's also largely responsible for the software's delay."}
