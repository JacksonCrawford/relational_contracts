gallegly (r-california), stomped down to the floor of the august us house of representatives to angrily denounce ... foot fetishes! \"people around the country are making 'crush videos.' these videos feature women wearing spiked heels crushing small animals with their feet.the videos are sold nationwide to people who enjoy this type of so-called 'foot fetish,' and sellers of the video are making millions of dollars,\" gallegly said in his speech.on tuesday his bill came to the house floor for a vote.it punishes physical and \"electronic images\" -- think jpegs -- of women stepping on \"small animals with their feet\" and other anti-beastie activities.as you might expect, the idea's pretty insane. it would, as ucla law professor eugene volokh points out, make it a crime to distribute documentaries showing spanish bullfights or publish national geographic with photos of poachers of endangered animals in africa.the house approved gallegly's bill by a 372-42 vote.whoops.gov: last week we told you about a new republican web site called -- what else? -- gop.gov.well, it turns out that the house republican conference site could be called a lot of other things instead. and, according to the rules controlling government web sites, it probably should be.the federal networking council-drafted document says, \"the .gov domain is for registration of us governmental entities on the federal level only ... subsidiary, non-autonomous components of top-level or other entities are not eligible for separate registration.\"translation: register gop.house.gov instead.besides, some veteran internet types wonder, if the gop can grab gop.gov, what about the socialists, libertarians, and greens?\"as a libertarian i am a firm believer in self-government,\" says john gilmore, board member of the electronic frontier foundation. \"can the libertarian party, one of the gop's peers and rivals, register self.gov?\"lean to the left: you know life's weird when diehard conservatives are getting accused of regulatory over-zealousness. but that's what happened this week.groups like phyllis schlafly's eagle forum and paul weyrich's free congress foundation have joined ralph nader and us pirg to make sure a banking overhaul bill regulates what customer information banks may be permitted to share with affiliates, such as mortgage companies.\"if the legislation passes in its present form, hr10 will overhaul the financial services industry placing financial privacy in a vulnerable position by allowing affiliate sharing and the sale of personal financial data to third parties,\" a recent alert from the free congress foundation said.not so fast, say free-market types, who argue that consumers should be encouraged to educate themselves and make their own choices about privacy policies.an aide to rep. ron paul (r-texas), the 1988 libertarian party presidential nominee, complained in an email to conservative groups that they were just plain, well, wrong.\"i suspect that there is a great and increasing market demand for financial institutions that do respect the privacy expectations of their customers. in fact, we see many institutions reacting to meet that demand (perhaps you and i should start a 'first national privacy bank,' i think we'd clean up!),\" the aide wrote.in an editorial friday, the wall street journal denounced pro-regulation conservatives such as sen. richard shelby as \"identity-confused republicans.\"the paper complained: \"he's demanding language that would mean a citigroup banker, say, couldn't tell a citigroup insurance agent that mr. jones is a hot insurance prospect -- unless mr. jones gives his permission in writing first. mr. shelby threatens to withhold his crucial vote unless this deal-breaker is written into the law.\"around the same time, the libertarians at the cato institute wrote a letter to the house-senate committee that's debating the bill. without taking direct aim at their sometime allies, the institute complained that some groups were going too far, and data-sharing can allow firms to provide information about new products and services.the competitive enterprise institute is planning an op-ed saying the same thing. no word yet on what the committee has decided.attn., louis freeh: washingtonians who want to tell someone from the internet engineering task force what they think about rewiring the net for easier wiretapping may want to show up at a meeting next wednesday.ietf chairman fred baker will be speaking at 6:30 p.m. in the mumford room of the library of congress's madison building on capitol hill. the dc chapter of the internet society is sponsoring the event, which is open to the general public.it'll give them something else to do: speaking of wiretapping and the ietf, the center for democracy and technology says the standards-setting group should stay away from endorsing snoopability.\"at this point, ietf should not seek to modify or design any protocol to support wiretapping,\" cdt attorney jim dempsey wrote in a post to an ietf mailing list on friday.\"first, no law requires ietf or any other body to develop a protocol or standard. in the us, calea imposes requirements on telecommunications carriers (basically, common carriers), not standards bodies or groups like ietf.\"still, there's something ietf can do, dempsey said: help the federal communications commission figure out what to do with a us law that requires telephone companies to make their lines easily tap-able.cdt says currently the fcc is planning to give the fbi \"the content of communications it is not authorized to intercept.\"\"by addressing this one question, ietf will be able to familiarize itself with the very difficult issues posed by attempting to meet [law enforcement's] broad and extensive desires for surveillance capabilities.and ietf participants could make a very real contribution to an ongoing, urgent debate in the us that privacy advocates have so far not been winning.\"more bernstein delays: the us justice department wants an appeals court to delay arguments in the bernstein encryption case, which argues government crypto-restrictions violate the first amendment.the doj on monday asked the ninth circuit to postpone oral arguments, currently set for 16 december.the reason is the forthcoming changes in encryption regulations, which the white house decided it would -- coincidentally -- release on 15 december.lawyers for bernstein oppose the motion. it seems pretty clear that the government's goal is simple: delay, delay, delay.so far an appeals court panel and a trial court have ruled against the clinton administration, so it's a fair bet to say they'll ultimately lose. but they show no signs of giving up gracefully.world's policeman -- or bully? during a recent meeting of the house armed services committee, the debate turned to banning encryption products that don't have backdoors for police surveillance.\"i'm probably way, way, way to the right of most everybody, i guess, on this committee, and certainly where the administration is at the moment, on the question of encryption,\" said rep. neil abercrombie (d-hawaii).\"i find it ironic that there would be a proposal to give the fbi tens of millions of dollars to try to overcome the encryption that we're going to sell to everybody, so's people can make money while we put our, i believe, put our security at risk,\" he said during the 5 october hearing.it seemed to be a bipartisan sentiment. \"if we're a leader of the world, then why don't we break some knuckles and force some people to understand the consequence of selling high technology items to the enemy?\" rep. john kasich (r-ohio) added.digital disappearance: call it the great vanishing bill caper. lobbyists are scratching their heads about what happened to an ostensibly non-controversial digital signature bill. late monday the house leadership nixed a scheduled tuesday floor vote on hr1714 -- supposedly because rep. john dingell (d-mich.) complained that he hadn't had time to review the latest version. but the buzz is that crotchety house judiciary committee chairman henry hyde (r-illinois) had his own thoughts about what should go in the legislation.staffers were supposed to work out details this week. but as of 6 p.m. friday: nada. \"we haven't heard anything about e-signatures,\" said us chamber of commerce's rick lane. \"we're all waiting to see what pops up.\""}
