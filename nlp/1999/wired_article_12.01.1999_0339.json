(audiophile alert: this latest sound processing technology from dolby should not be confused with the impressive but less versatile sony dolby digital surround - see \"the 11 factor,\" in wired tools.)the 3-d effect was amazing, though it seemed the movie dialog came from inside my head. the other surround-sound effects were pronounced - maybe excessive. dolby headphone has more depth than many listeners are used to, and loud explosions will make you jump; the woman next to me had to keep adjusting the volume. still, i'd never heard anything like it - truly supersonic audio.dolby headphone: standard in all seats. singapore airlines: (800) 742 3333, street credrest in inner peacerip-and-roll highwaybiodetectivemagic markershead triphelping handelectric avenuereadmemusicpocket portalwords for windowsthe boy mechanicspin doctorsjust outta betathrash and burnthe long view on short-term profiteerscontributors"}
