this:http://art.com/artgallery/default.asp?sid=9df4bc0580df11d3acb60090271e26a8&command=freelist.a beautiful painting, but such an ugly url.get used to it. web sites look more polished and sophisticated with every surf of the web. obviously, flashy design is not always reflected in the cumbersome, gobbledy-gook urls where the sites reside.shouldn't an url \u2013 uniform resource locator \u2013 look clean and be easy to remember, giving you some clue as to where you are and what you're looking at? after all, it's a cyberspace address.but web surfers frequently see unsightly gibberish grow in their browser address/location bar as they move from web page to page. and as the web expands, the urls get longer. users are left wondering what the cryptic characters mean ... and, oh yeah, how will they ever find that page again, much less email a cool site to a friend?\"it's complex getting from point a to point b especially on something as convoluted as the web,\" said tony rodrigues, director of digital music group, a division of ynot.com. \"the more complex the directory structure, the longer the url is going to be.\"rodrigues said the structure is similar to a computer's hard drive that houses organized directories and subdirectories. because there are more web sites with more content, more information has to be organized.for example, this wired news story is located under: https://www.wired.com/news/culture/ 0,1284,31721,00.html. the url starts with the name of the site, then the news directory. the second \"news\" is actually an html file that constructs the page: it tells what ads to pull up, and sets the frames. \"culture\" denotes the article section, then story, then the story identification number.that's not too bad, but look at this:http://www.drugemporium.com/cec/cstage?eccookie=@eccookie@&ecaction=de_ecwalkin&template=de_walkin.en.htm.that's exactly what appears after typing in the seemingly innocent http://www.drugemporium.com. why?the apparent gibberish tracks the behavior of users on the site, said jim schanzenbach, the chief technology officer for drugemporium.com.the \"eccookie\" portion of the url refers to variables that contain cookie information stored in the browser. this information used to be embedded in the url, but it added too many bytes.\"it used to be quite a bit longer than that \u2013 probably five times as long,\" he said.on many sites, as the user moves from page to page the url gets longer as more and more information is tracked.sometimes urls grow if a site is in the process of a restructuring, as in the case of ynot.com, the electronic greeting cards site. if a user types in http://www.ynot.com, they are redirected to http://preview.ynot.com/cgibin/nd_cgi_50.cgi/ynotphoenix/cfsmain.\"the reason for that is the site is running on a new database architecture that we implemented about a month ago,\" said rodrigues, adding that the short and sweet url will return in a month or so.search engines present the worst example of url uglification. check out this search for a shrimp restaurant on sf gate, the online service of the san francisco chronicle and examiner:http://www.sfgate.com/cgibin/srch_archive/dropdn_srch.cgi?template=templates2ftypes2ffood2ffd_ddstemplate.shtml&item=templates%2ftypes%2ffood%2ffd_ddsitem.txt&subject=restaurants%2band%2breview&keyword=shrimp&datesearch=366&year=.the search archive is a directory where the search program lives, and the dropdn_srch.cgi is the name of the particular search program. a template is used to display the results so it looks consistent with the kind of search.the question marks indicate to the server where the parameters of the search begin. chris hallenbeck, the quality assurance manager for the sfgate, said that what follows are different names and values of things that are used to run the search, making the results unique.he added that while the url may be ugly, the search script makes production easier.\"it gives us an infinite level of customization, but we end up with long urls,\" he said.hallenbeck pointed out the web site where the search originates is a svelte, sensible http://www.sfgate.com/eguide/food/restaurants/reviews/. that's what he hopes people will bookmark and return to. hallenbeck said it makes the site easier to manage over time.\"if this is the only page you've bookmarked then we don't have to worry about more urls becoming obsolete,\" he said.using the favorites list is one obvious way to avoid long urls.besides, browsers are smarter these days, and they do have a few tricks yet.most people know that if a url exists on your favorites list or you've visited the site recently, the full url will magically appear after typing a few characters into the address box.\"it makes a big difference to someone who types in a lot of urls,\" hallenbeck said. \"it's a matter of convenience.\"newer browsers will also do an automatic search if you type in a few words in the address window. microsoft and netscape use different search engines to power the searches. people can contact ftp \u2013 file transfer protocol \u2013 sites through their browser instead of opening a separate program, hallenbeck said.but despite cool browser shortcuts, the urls are still growing like jack's beanstalk.\"although we've come a long way, this is where we're lacking,\" said rodrigues.he suggested developing a logo or an icon that a user could drag and drop into an email or browser that would become active.and sometimes sites just don't have the resources to spend beautifying their urls.\"there are probably a lot more shortcuts that we could make, but given our somewhat limited budget, we are more apt to fix things that are broken instead of making our urls shorter,\" hallenbeck said.so until we reach that url nirvana, \"just don't look at the address bar,\" rodrigues said. \"you'll still get where you need to go.\"even if the information superhighway isn't all that scenic."}
