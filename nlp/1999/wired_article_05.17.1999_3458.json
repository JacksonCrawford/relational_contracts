[bombing] seems like not the smartest way to get this worked on.\"another post on the site read: \"dear friends! we are minsk radio 101.2, closed by lukashenko three years ago.... your experience of fighting and working is a good example for us and everyone who respects freedom of speech and liberty.\"a trancey set full of sitars followed sid griffin's sign off, courtesy of london's dj pathaan. next, canada's john acquaviva took over to spin house.this is global radio.in belgrade, longtime b92 staffer vladimir janjic described the webcast as \"very close to how we sounded, somewhere between alternative rock music and the best contemporary dance music.\"in oslo, norway, b92 fan per platou listened most of the day.\"the whole webcast helps us to keep the faith,\" said platou. \"the birds and traffic sounds from belgrade mixed into the stream were very comforting.\" he said he had found the war \"even more eerie\" since b92 was seized and its regular live stream killed.in taiwan, another long-time listener, ilya lee, said the musical web stream created a feeling of solidarity. \"that connectedness is so powerful, contagious, and delightful. i am glad that i [could] become a fan again.\"in amsterdam, a local pirate station picked up free b92's realaudio signal and put it on the air. stations in austria, switzerland, and slovenia were reportedly doing the same.amsterdam media critic geert lovink said, \"civil society [in yugoslavia] and its media have been crushed. media which refuse to spread propaganda are being shut down. but events such as netaid remind us of different times.\""}
