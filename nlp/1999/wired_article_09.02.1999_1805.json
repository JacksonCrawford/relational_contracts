paper books obsolete. but the buzz on e-books at seybold means this time, the hour may be nigh. leander kahney reports from san francisco.", "author": "leander kahney", "category": "science", "type":

e-books and multimedia texts. the time is right, stein told a keynote audience at seybold seminars san francisco, to provide authors with a simple means to assemble books, papers, and other texts for distribution electronically.stein believes that, after decades of promise, the era of e-books has finally arrived.\"i'm pretty confident that the locus of intellectual discourse will shift from the print medium to the electronic medium,\" the veteran publisher said wednesday.he's not alone. e-publishing was a key topic at this week's seybold seminars. at the show, a number of industry leaders, including giants like microsoft, adobe, and xerox, announced major e-publishing products and initiatives.as stein pointed out during his speech, some of the key criteria for e-publishing are beginning to materialize:in an interview after the keynote, stein said the shift to electronic publishing will happen because it's much richer than print: it easily facilitates links to other information sources, it supports multimedia, and it affords a richer interaction between authors, publishers and readers.\"a magazine like wired unconnected to the net doesn't make sense,\" he said. \"it must be connected to the net, whether it's through a phone line or wirelessly, it doesn't matter. but if i'm reading about something groovy on the internet, i want to be able to go see it.\"unlike other seybold pundits, stein said he doesn't foresee the death of traditional print or publishing houses. more than ever, there's going to be the need for good publishers and editors.\"i'm not interested in vanity publishing,\" he said. \"i don't necessarily want to see a world where everyone is an author. i want to see a world where authors express themselves electronically.\"stein said there are a lot of people sitting on mountains of unpublished digitized material. academics, for example, could take advantage of the medium to publish collections of papers or monographs.but for traditional publishers, e-publishing is a monster lurking in the shadows.\"the thing [publishers] are really worried about before they put their content online is: \"is it going to get ripped off like an mp3?\" is how charles myers, adobe's director of business development, put it.hoping to prevent wholesale \"ripping off,\" adobe's pdf merchant will compete with microsoft and the open ebook initiative in providing a secure format for delivering e-books over the net.horace dediu, ceo of handheld media and one of the authors of the open ebook standard, said there are advantages and disadvantages to both formats.microsoft, and the open ebook initiative which it is backing, are pushing web-friendly markup formats which use little bandwidth and scale easily to different devices and screen sizes, dediu said.adobe's pdf is a print-centric format that preserves a document's design but requires more memory, processing power, and bigger screens. adobe's advantage is that the publishing industry has standardized around the related postscript format, making it easy to convert archived material to pdf.\"i think the two will co-exist happily together for a while,\" he said. \"but i think they will eventually merge.\"meanwhile, jon schull, cto of softlock, said the industry still hasn't figured out what it means to buy and own e-books. how do libraries lend them, for example?\"e-books will move from person and person and device to device,\" schull said. \"and we must have some clever technology to ensure it's paid for at each step of the way.\"softlock's browse, buy, and redistribute scheme allows a reader to browse through a text before buying it. once it's paid for, the text is forever tied to the reader's device -- whether its a pc or a handheld. in many cases, the reader is free to redistribute the text, although it reverts to the browse state when it's transferred from the original reader's machine.xerox showcased contentguard, a software suite for protecting the copyrights of digital content. developed at the company's famous xerox parc, contentguard protects copyrights, prevents unauthorized redistribution and tracks customer usage, the company said.schull said the technology should become more adaptable when pcs and handhelds have built-in biometrics that can identify the user. he noted, for example, that apple's forthcoming mac os 9 will have voice-print recognition.but schull said marketing is one problem still to be resolved.\"we've already solved the technology problem. the net solves the distribution problem, but we still have to tackle the problem publishers are really interested in -- selling,\" he said.craig cline, vice president of content development and editorial director of seybold seminars, said the channel doesn't necessarily matter. e-books are analogous to the mp3 music format: they threaten to cut out the middleman between artists and their audience.\"what will really kick this over is when authors wake up and realize they don't have to be slaves to the publishing houses,\" he said.cline conceded there would still be a role for companies to market and hype the books. \"but look at how good amazon is at doing that.\""}
