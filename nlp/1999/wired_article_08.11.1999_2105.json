center shooting suspect buford o. furrow jr., including ties to aryan nations and a photo in a nazi uniform. by lindsey arent.", "author": "lindsey arent", "category": "security", "type": "article", "timestamp": "08.11.1999 09:05 AM", "text": "an internet human-rights watchdog group says it is currently tracking information about shooting suspect buford o. furrow jr. furrow, who surrended wednesday in las vegas, is the prime suspect in tuesday's shooting at a jewish community center in los angeles that left five people wounded, including three small boys.brian youngblood, the internet information specialist at the southern poverty law center in montgomery, alabama, said the group is collecting information tying furrow to supremacist group aryan nations in 1995. the center has a photo of furrow in a nazi uniform, taken that year at the aryan nations' compound in hayden lake, idaho.according to police reports, a van believed to have been driven by furrow contained a book, war cycles, peace cycles, written by richard kelly hoskins.according to mark potok, editor of splc's intelligence report, hoskins is \"one of the principal ideologues of christian identity,\" a religious group that considers jews to be the \"seed of satan.\"joe roy, director of the intelligence project at the splc, said, \"we've been tracking these groups online since the bulletin board days, before the internet. we've recruited college-age techies and have developed software to help them pick out hate groups.\"the splc is a nonprofit watchdog organization that monitors hate groups in the united states. it funds a 12-member research team that scours the net daily, tracking hate sites, message boards, emails and storing tips regarding hate groups. every piece of information, including news articles, emails, pamphlets and videos, is stored in the center's electronic database.white supremacist, neo-nazi, ku klux klan, and christian separatist organizations, all classified as hate groups by their opponents, are having tremendous success signing up recruits over the net. but for every step an extremist takes, someone is watching, collecting information to use it against them.the net has transformed the way white supremacists spread their message. the archaic methods of newsletters and phone calls have been replaced by an efficient network of slick web sites, newsgroups, and online merchandising, according to vincent breeding, director of the nationalist news agency, a pro-white web site.\"we don't have money to have tv and newspaper ads,\" said breeding, who runs the site from his laptop in tampa, florida. \"the net has allowed us to reach people in a way we never could with our limited resources.\"at the same time, the internet has also given watchdog organizations the ability to monitor hate groups and collect elaborate data about their movements.\"we identify the sites, we archive them and we watch the pages for changes,\" said youngblood. \"that\u2019s word for word, character for character. we collect it and store it.\"the splc goes through a strict approval process when deciding what is a web site worth watching. \"it's a hate group if it's biased against religion, sex, or creed,\" youngblood said. \"but it depends, there are so many different categories.\"the splc uses a specially modified software program that scans and monitors more than 500 pre-selected web sites daily, alerting researchers to the most minute changes.but it's a difficult process to monitor. \"we're trying to keep up with them,\" youngblood said. \"with 500 sites, each with an average of 40 pages, you might get a couple thousand changes every day.\"internet hate sites are growing steadily. in 1997, the splc identified 163 sites. by the end of 1998, the number had risen to 254, an increase of nearly 60 percent.\"there's no question that the net is one of the key factors in the growth of hate groups,\" said roy. \"these groups are reaching people who would've never been exposed to it otherwise.\"researchers at the simon wiesenthal center in los angeles have also reported major increases in web hate activites. on a new cd-rom called digital hate 2000, the center lists 1,426 hate-related sites, pages, and links that date to april 1999.while the net has allowed watchdog groups to better track hate group activities, rabbi abraham cooper, dean of the wiesenthal center, sees the net as a potentially dangerous instrument of communication rather than a boon to intelligence gathering.\"the power of the net has been harnessed by people who are devoted racists,\" he said. \"it has allowed them to communicate and empower themselves.\"the splc collects information on klan, neo-nazi, skinhead, and militant christian activites, which can later be used as evidence in the center's civil trials, turned over to law enforcement, or stored for future reference.\"we gather intelligence,\" roy said. \"something that could be garbage today could be gold tomorrow.\"in one example, the center used information taken from its database, including emails, answering machine recordings and literature, in a successful lawsuit against white aryan resistance leader tom metzger. metzger was held responsible for a murder committed in 1988 by his followers.the splc also works closely with law enforcement, conducting classes and training on \"hate or militant anti-government groups\" across the country, according youngblood.although pro-white groups have seen membership rolls increase through internet communications, leaders of extremist groups admit that the monitoring has taken its toll. \"the whole idea of monitoring is misleading,\" said don black, director of , stormfront, an online information hub for white supremacists.\"they pressure isp's to shut down the accounts of people whose views they find offensive. the purpose of these groups is to harass and suppress information which they don't like.\"still, extremist groups continue to openly recruit online and take advantage of the vast opportunities offered by the internet.one site world church of the creator has recently launched operation internet blitzkrieg, a grassroots public relations strategy to boost recruitment and awareness through a blizzard of links and messages posted in chat rooms all over the net.oddly enough, the stated goal of the internet campaign is to, um, diversify. \"there isn't much point in spending all your time in a chat room full of other white racial loyalists,\" the site reads, \"do your part white man, in expanding creativity on the net.\"the site continues, \"the internet has the potential to reach millions of white people with our message and we need to act on that immediately\u2026we call on all creators and white racial loyalists to go to chat rooms and debate and recruit with new people, post our url everywhere, as soon as possible.\"don black, director of stormfront, said the net provides an anonymous space where pro-white people can find support regardless of where they live or their situation.stormfront's white nationalist resource page is an aryan portal, replete with chat rooms and rhetoric tailored to kids and women. there are faqs about racism, links to related sites and even a section devoted to aryan singles, where members can find that special, racially pure mate.\"our purpose is to provide a resource for people who are interested in our point of view,\" said black. \"the net has made information about our point of view readily available to practically anyone.\"others find that the net provides white supremacists with a kind of virtual family.\"people for years have felt alone, like they're afraid to tell their friends what they believe, and the net allows them to express their ideas and connect with others\" said breeding of the nationalist news agency.\"it's for people who just want to be around more of their own kind.\""}
