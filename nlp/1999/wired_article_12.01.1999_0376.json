at best, you get a familiar quotations variety of mummery. at worst, you get george will (who, come to think of it, should be on this list himself) and the art of judging our contemporary mongrel nation (and finding it wanting) against the imaginary standard of the anglo nation tocqueville observed in the 1830s. proponents of school vouchers or english-only ballot initiatives should be able to make their cases without compulsively reaching back to half-comprehended philosophies written before the civil war (see \"the civil war\") or chloroforming the intellectual import of a classic of political theory. in the future, all americans should be forced to read tocqueville and forbidden to quote him.__7 __ recovered-memory syndrome__8 __ modern primitives__9 __ the civil war recapping that final score: north 1, south 0.__10 __ the second gunman__11 __ celebrity interviews__12 __ activex__13 __ \"i'm not a luddite, but ... \" the technorealists, the kirkpatrick saleses, the stolls and the svens, the douglas rushkoffs ... are they really so different from us?

(\"still the best graphics platform in the world!\" \"who cares about the business market?\") like most revolutions, this one has brought more privation than liberty - nonstop crashes, software famine, a customer-service department that would do a bolshevik proud. but these bourgeois concerns always meant little next to the pride of being one of the elect. now that \"think different\" is growing a bit long in the tooth, we suggest a new battle cry for appleniks, one that really explains why true believers are willing to forgo the greater speed, power, and affordability of the pc: \"it's not about satisfaction - it's about self-satisfaction.\"__40 __ the pc__41 __ local tv news__42 __ castro by now, this is truly a no-hard-feelings selection. but since we've given up hoping that chest-thumping yankee lawmakers and hard-case exiles will ever stop despising their straw-man nemesis, maybe we should just let the human life span work its diplomatic magic. we want cigars, you want mtv. surely we can strike a deal?__43 __ 007__44 __ 404__45 __ antibacterial soap thank you, obsessive-compulsives, for breeding soap-resistant supergerms.__46 __ retro like accelerating contractions heralding some monstrous birth, the cycle times of nostalgia (which in the 17th century was rightly viewed as a mental illness) have grown alarmingly short. the '90s saw not only a swing revival (scary enough, given that participants had no actual experience of the original) but, a few years later, a revival of the revival. kids who don't remember the '60s are condemned to relive them, and while '80s retro seems to have collapsed under the realization of the decade's essential cultural worthlessness, we suspect we're only in remission. we've already seen the first stirrings of a grunge comeback, and we take no comfort in the knowledge that whatever else today may be, it's somebody's future good old days. only the ongoing communications revolution, with its empowerment of diehard cultists, offers relief from the eternal return of retro: in the future, nothing will ever go out of style, so nothing will ever come back.__47 __ trilogies__48 __ bouncers__49 __ dumb prompts \"are you sure you want to permanently remove these items?\"__50 __ interface metaphors few things have done more to set back the progress of technology than interface metaphors. being able to tell some hapless newbie that \"it's just like a telephone\" may get the technophobic pants-wetter over that initial anxiety attack, but it shackles the rest of us to the ground. it's not a telephone, or a desktop, or a tv, or a tree, or a conversation with a talking paper clip. it's a computer, and while the kind of computer you actually have to deal with may soon be rendered obsolete (see \"the pc\") by chip-enabled lawn mowers and email-activated microwave ovens, let's get over the hand-holding.__51 __ wrinkles__52 __ metamedia__53 __ the penny__54 __ inheritances do the math: heir/heiress to large fortune = human train wreck. maybe you needed the summer home and the schooner ... but do your kids? it's time to rid the world of spoiled adults.__55 __ rehab__56 __ cops__57 __ cops__58 __ breast implants someday everyone will agree that they're about as attractive as plastic covers on furniture or wax grapes in fake urns on living-room walls. in the meantime, we'll skip the health issues and the unrealistic-body-image arguments and just say there's something weird about an accessory you can never take off.__59 __ tough-guy big-city columnists__60 __ first novels__61 __ zero tolerance__62 __ disintermediation__63 __ e-anything__64 __ global business network undoubtedly, the life of a self-employed policy mandarin is a grand one: living large with besotted ceos who suck on the helium of your big-picture bloviation; abstracting the world's problems until they become an avalon hill strategy game; savoring the mood as your dense and profound statements (\"... in an era of dramatic change, the future is very unpredictable\") echo through the corridors of power. and gbn - a sort of trilateral commission for the ditherati - lives larger than most, peddling its clever aper\u00e7us to corporations in need of \"scenarios\" for the future. we're in no way comforted by gbn's propensity for strenuously rendered id\u00e9es re\u00e7ues.
