menace is crossing light sabers with george lucas, claiming industrial light and magic owes a huge debt to cheap software and standard macintosh computers. by leander kahn", "author": "leander kahney", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "05.19.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "the new star wars movie has sparked a battle of its own.the makers of a special-effects package used in episode i: the phantom menace bought high-profile advertising space this week to complain that george lucas hasn't acknowledged the contribution made by its software, electric image.play inc., of rancho cordova, california, printed an open letter to lucas in the hollywood reporter saying that the publicity he promised the company hasn't materialized.\"dear mr. lucas,\" began the letter, which appeared on monday, \"we're writing this letter to ask you for your help in stopping an injustice.\"signed by paul montgomery and mike moore, play's co-ceos, the letter says that lucas' production company, industrial light and magic, is \"uncomfortable acknowledging just how much of this historic motion picture was created with low-cost software running on standard macintosh computers.\"the letter says the movie's producer, rick mccallum, told them that without play's software the movie could not have been completed on time and under-budget.according to the letter, mccallum promised the company that the software's significant contribution would be publicly acknowledged in articles about the film.but, as the articles started coming out, the co-ceos say they were stunned to see no mention of their electric image software, which creates 3-d digital environments.\"mr. lucas, for years you and your brilliant creations have set a shining example for us all,\" the letter says. \"today we're asking you to again set an example. as the phantom menace prepares to go into the history books, please step forward to make sure the truth goes with it.\"montgomery claimed that electric image was responsible for between 300 and 400 on-screen shots, including backgrounds of some big set pieces, such as the pod race and scenes of the royal palace.according to montgomery, ilm had mentioned the software only once, in last month's wired magazine interview with george lucas, and that lucas had downplayed electric image's contribution, saying that it was used only at the previsualization stage.\"george lucas is a personal hero,\" montgomery said. \"so i can't tell you what mixed emotions we're doing this with. but there are people around here who worked very hard on this and they're not getting the recognition.\"montgomery claimed that play pulled out the stops for ilm. play was planning a port of the electric image renderer from the mac to windows nt but instead ported it to the silicon graphics (sgi) platform at ilm's behest. \"sgi isn't an important platform for us,\" montgomery said. \"we only did it for ilm. we've never sold it commercially.\"ellen pasternack, a spokeswoman for ilm, said that play had exaggerated electric image's role in creating the movie's special effects.\"play has misrepresented their work on the film and, while we appreciate their contribution, we use dozens of off-the-shelf software products,\" she said.in any event, pasternack said that at this stage ilm is not talking about any of the visualization tools used in the movie.she said that, with few exceptions, ilm has never discussed special effects in the movies it has worked on until weeks after the films opened.\"we want to preserve the magic and keep the audience guessing until after the movie comes out,\" pasternack said.pasternack said that electric image, along with other tools used in the film, is being discussed now for articles due out this summer.she said that even companies that deserve most of the credit for the film's effects, such as silicon graphics, haven't yet been discussed in detail in the press.\"it's not like we're doing stories where we mention everyone but play,\" she said.\"whenever a big movie comes out, people come out of the woodwork to take credit. but those that deserve it don't usually jump up and down to get it.\"pasternack dismissed industry gossip that ilm was under an sgi gag order -- known as the \"jedi agreement\" -- that prevents it from talking about competitors' products.pasternack said that the jedi agreement was simply a cross-marketing agreement that placed no restrictions on publicity for products made by sgi's competitors, such as play.anne hohenberger, entertainment pr manager at sgi, said that sgi is also waiting until the summer to talk about star wars' special effects.\"we're holding off on telling the effects story until the film has had a chance to take hold,\" she said.an independent special-effects artist associated with ilm, who asked not to be named, said that play was shooting itself in the foot by crossing ilm, an industry powerhouse, in what he described as \"a publicity stunt.\"\"i think it's a big mistake on play's part,\" he said. \"they want the publicity but, in my opinion, this is the wrong way to do it. they're really going to get screwed by ilm for this.\""}
