these are the most beautiful things in the world.luck is on my side today: the minimall is blessed with a church thrift store. a bell hanging from the doorknob jingles as i walk in, and a kind-looking woman smiles from behind the counter. i smile back meekly, drop the backpack by the door, and look around the tiny shop. in a few minutes i've found some ragged jeans, undersized reeboks, and a book bag from a pacific bell technical conference. i change in the dressing room. the woman smiles again, perhaps knowingly, as i pay her from a manila envelope.i briefly consider donating the backpack and my old khaki pants but decide to throw them away outside instead. i swagger out into the parking lot to wait for my ride, secure in my normalcy. i don't think anyone noticed me get out of the government-issue pickup truck by the side of the road an hour ago. aside from my overly pale complexion, there's nothing to set me apart now. no one could tell i've just been released from federal prison in dublin, california.i light up a smoke and pace while i wait for mark to pick me up. i know mark from the '80s, when we shared a condo near the silicon valley defense contractor where we both worked. but i'm not thinking about the past, or the future. i'm in the moment - i catch myself standing with my arms outstretched, unconsciously reaching out to the open space around me.then i notice it: a billboard along the freeway embankment. i'm not even aware of what it's advertising. all i see is the cryptic string of letters at the bottom, beginning with \"http://\" and ending with \".com.\" i stare at it, gaping. i know what an internet domain looks like, and i've seen plenty of billboards in my life, but together they pose an incongruity that i can't wrap my mind around. i had heard things on the inside, of course. i knew the world had changed - it's been five years, after all. but i'm totally unprepared for this visual evidence. as i stare, the cigarette burns down to my fingers.prehistory is seldom exciting; you rarely know that the events of a particular time and place will someday be the stuff of legend. people who went to high school with bill gates didn't know he would become so important in their memories of adolescence that they would repeat endlessly, \"i went to high school with bill gates.\"so it was with the internet in the '80s. it was insular and cloistered, a little weird. it was an email system, a research tool, a taxpayer-funded computer geek's toy. it dealt in telnet, ftp, tcp/ip, icmp, packet switching, and gateways. an internet address on your business card was de rigueur in the defense world, but it was strange to outsiders - the hallmark of a reclusive drone who spent too much time staring into a computer. the net was your amusing but nerdy friend who would never amount to anything much.that was the internet i left behind when i went to prison in 1991, convicted of phone hacking (while being cleared of several more serious charges involving national-security violations). when i walked out five years later, the net had evolved into a thriving parallel universe so unprecedented that the populace had drawn from science fiction to christen it \"cyberspace.\"\"the web really isn't that amazing,\" mark explained as we drove south toward san jose and my flight home to los angeles. \"it's built on a protocol called http, which is really just a file transfer system like ftp.\"\"and it's mostly used for advertising, right?\" i said, remembering the billboard.mark quit trying to explain and offered to show me. after a two-hour drive into the valley, he turned into a quiet cul-de-sac where shade trees and perfect lawns garnished a ring of ranch-style homes. pulling his new sports car to the curb, he told me to wait while he made a quick pit stop, then dashed into the house the internet built.in the half decade i was away, mark had parlayed his networking expertise into a successful business, something called a \"web hosting\" service. the largest of his house's seven rooms was going to be devoted to his computers, but because he'd just moved in, the equipment was still set up at our old condo.in my absence, the internet evolved from a geeky cloister into a thriving parallel universe.we zipped over to the condo and slipped into the computer room - the space was neat, quiet, well organized, enveloped in the white noise of cooling fans. mark sidled up to a sun workstation and tapped a few keystrokes, and the screen filled with text and graphics. \"this,\" he explained, \"is a web site.\"\"this'll be fun,\" he said, typing again.the page changed. the word \"altavista\" appeared. then mark did something very scary: he typed in my name. after a few seconds, the page filled with brief excerpts, some of them in french and german, from what i assumed were other web sites. the total number of search matches appeared at the bottom. it was a four-digit number.mark grinned at my stunned expression and clicked on one of the excerpts. the screen went black, then reassembled itself beneath the headline \"a crime by any other name\":he may have seen himself as above the law, a computer hacker who used his talents strictly for juvenile fun and the pursuit of knowledge. but kevin poulsen's actions turned into the first-ever espionage case against a hacker... he is being held pending trial in san francisco for theft of classified information.the ersatz news article was copyrighted by the church of scientology.scientologists?on this vast new medium, which had become so ubiquitous that advertisers could put web addresses on billboards with no further explanation, people were talking about me. the web clearly was much more than just advertising.and for the duration of the next three years, i would be excluded from the whole thing.it was straightforward enough. i was released from prison as the first american to be banned from the internet. much as securities swindlers are typically barred from the stock market, my computer-crime convictions dictated that i should, for an extended period, be kept offline for the good of society.on the most practical level, this forecast a kind of internal exile for me. back home in la, i set myself to the banal tasks of reentering society: replacing my lost driver's license and social security card, finding a place to live - and getting a job that didn't require computer access. everything was the same, but completely different. i felt certain every home now had a pc and a modem - the phone lines snaking down the street were no longer just conduits for phone calls, but rather part of a shadow nation beyond my reach. i needed a diplomatic presence. i needed a web site.i wanted to compose a one-way message to the citizens of cyberspace, but i knew nothing about their language and customs. i approached my mission with a new appreciation for the anxieties nasa scientists must have felt in the 1970s when they inscribed a message to alien civilizations on the voyager deep-space probes. i culled some legal documents about my case (you can never go wrong with raw data), banged out some explanatory text, and snail-mailed it all to lile, a northern california abstract painter who had mastered web design while creating art.net, an online gallery for other artists. she had offered to cobble together a web page for me - an online presence was permissible through a third party - so my fingers need never touch a forbidden keyboard.i dropped a photo of myself into the package; whatever else it might be, i gathered that the new internet was a multimedia thing.lile worked fast, and i received my first trickle of feedback a week later. \"your page is getting a hundred hits a day,\" she announced over the phone. one hundred people, every day, taking the trouble to find my page out of untold thousands, learning my story.\"that's good, right?\"\"not particularly.\"now my parents complain about slow modems, and offering url is as natural as breathing.it's a few months after my release, and i'm having dinner with my parents. and they're talking about computers: the speed of their modem, the slowness of their isp, \"spam.\" my dad, it seems, has just got in his first flame war on some kind of automotive forum. flame wars are an artifact of the internet i knew. but my dad ... in a flame war. it's a difficult concept - i might as well have run into him at a rave.my father, a retired auto mechanic, and my mother, a retired schoolteacher, had never had much use for computers. but the internet boom, coupled with the hype surrounding windows 95, gave them a reason to buy their first. now they surf the web from the same room where i, as a teenager, used a trs-80 and a 300-baud modem to go online. now they understand.by this summer of 1996, mom and dad have become fonts of knowledge on everything from obscure business news to information about distant branches of the family tree. dad credits the internet with much of his success in playing the stock market. he's addicted to instant quotes and online business news. and he's always ready with a new joke - something impossibly topical, as though he has a personal gag writer standing by with a copy of tomorrow's newspaper. the quips are always funny, but whenever i try retelling one to a friend, i don't get far. \"heard it,\" they interrupt. \"that's an old one.\"i see other net influences every day now. everyone, it seems, has voicemail - or their answering machines are perpetually on so they can screen their calls. the telephone network has become vacant and inhuman; people have abandoned spontaneous voice communication in their rush online; businesses force me through five layers of a multiple-choice, prerecorded hierarchy before allowing me even to leave a message. and if i somehow succeed in getting a flesh-and-blood human on the other end of the line, i know what to expect: \"what's your email address?\"\"i'm, uh, not on the internet.\"this is invariably followed by a moment of awkward silence. most netizens, it seems, regard offliners with the same mixture of pity and contempt they reserve for panhandlers. odd, since the vast majority of american households get along fine without internet access. but the reaction, at least in the circles i travel in, is that there must be something wrong with you.people rarely have the courage to ask me why i'm not online, though - it's as if just hearing the answer might condemn them to a similar fate. when someone does ask, i offer the nutshell version, and the nature of the sympathy i receive is still surprising: \"five years in prison? well, you did commit a crime. but being barred from the internet? that's inhumane!\"even people who know sometimes forget. this evening, at my parents', my mother says, \"there's an article for you on the refrigerator.\" it's a clipping that not-so-subtly reflects mom and dad's concern over the nicotine habit i picked up in the big house: \"web helps smokers kick the habit.\" a series of web addresses is included. though my parents know that using the internet would be as harmful to my liberty as smoking is to my health, i don't blame them; i've grown accustomed to such forgetfulness. offering url seems to have become as natural as breathing.constantly, gently, i was trying to persuade my probation officer to let me online. after my first year of freedom, he permitted me to use a computer at home for wordprocessing - provided it was modem-free. i had to submit a copy of my phone bill each month so he could inspect it for computer dialups. one month, i circled the url www.gte.com at the bottom of the bill and impulsively scribbled a note: \"ever notice how ubiquitous these things are?\"we talked about this issue at length nearly every time we met, and he was neither reactionary nor dogmatic, reasoning intelligently and listening willingly. maybe it's just stockholm syndrome, but i almost came to think of him as a friend.still, he dealt with drug addicts on a daily basis, and he'd spotted the same demonic gleam in my eye. computers can be addictive, he explained, the internet even more so, and he was responsible not only for encouraging my rehabilitation, but for protecting society from a known bit junkie.though i didn't have a modem, i eventually left my minimum-wage job as a political canvasser and went to work \"on\" the net. with the internet becoming indispensable to millions of americans, i began making the media rounds as the amazing modemless man. the interviews i gave about life as an information have-not led to a surprising offer - as a wordsmith on the world wide web.\"could i use webtv to hack the pentagon and launch nukes?\" i asked the salesman. \"no,\" he laughed uneasily. \"unless you were really good.\"zdtv, the broadcast division of ziff-davis, was launching your computer channel, a 24-hour cable tv network dedicated to computers and the internet. i was offered a job as a columnist for the companion zdtv web site, an online brand extension of the cable channel. my editor would fax me reader mail and send along web-site printouts and online searches for phone numbers (directory-assistance operators, as if sensing their impending obsolescence, no longer bothered to give accurate information).the irony wasn't lost on me. writing for the web put me in the unusual position of reporting and opining to an audience that had far greater access to raw data than i did (not to mention having direct access to my columns). my phone bill crawled into the hundreds of dollars as i reached out to netizens through the path of greatest resistance.eighteen months after my release, with one year of probation remaining, my probation officer was ready to let me loose on the net. but the proposal came with a caveat: i had to find an internet service provider that would agree to monitor my actions and give my po access to the traffic reports on demand.yes! i was in. i now knew enough about the net from the mainstream media to suppose that it was as rife with surveillance and snooping as with hardcore porn and illegal gambling. i thought it would be a breeze.i hit the phones, starting with a small isp in los angeles.\"you want us to what?\"i explained my situation, and a dubious technician said he'd ask around. two days later he called back: \"we just don't have the facilities to monitor you. sorry.\"i moved up to the big ones: aol, msn, prodigy, compuserve. the poor service reps on the other end of the phone didn't quite know what to make of my request - they seemed to think it was a trick of some sort.\"you want us to monitor you? we don't do that, sir. we respect our customers' privacy.\"there was a glimmer of hope when i called earthlink, where dan farmer, a well-known hacker and author of the famous unix-cracking tool satan, runs the security department. if anyone could keep tabs on me, it was him. dan thought about it, clicked through the possibilities in his mind, and gave up after a few seconds. \"i really couldn't set up anything that you couldn't get around,\" he said. i think it was meant as a compliment.but dan suggested an alternative: webtv - a set-top technological solution that, while it wouldn't provide the monitoring my po wanted, was so limited in functionality as to pose little risk of my bypassing firewalls and hacking web sites to feed my bandwidth habit.this proposal culminated in the bizarre spectacle of my po and me walking into an outlet of the good guys!, the consumer-electronics chain, to check out the webtv system. the salesman fired up the unit, demonstrated the wireless keyboard, then handed it to my po, who soon was completely engrossed in some baseball statistics he found at a sports site. the addictive potential of the net in action.while he surfed, i started interrogating the salesman. \"if i really wanted to, could i use this system to break in to a pentagon computer and launch nuclear missiles?\"the salesman laughed uneasily. \"no, not at all,\" he said, adding, \"unless you were really good.\"my po grinned and handed me the keyboard, and i quickly typed in a url to check out my column on the zdtv site. it looked pretty good, although the picture of me sucked.as we left the store, he acknowledged that i couldn't do any harm with webtv. his concern shifted to my attitude. at his request, i'd been giving him hard copies of my zdtv columns, and he explained that he found some of my opinions disquieting. in one piece, i had argued that a 1997 web-site hack directed at the indonesian government to protest the occupation of east timor constituted a legitimate form of direct political action. with ideas like that kicking around inside my head, my po decided it was premature to let me go online.it was late spring 1998, and i'd nearly ended my second year as an offliner in a connected world. i was in my apartment - pathetically trying to simulate the internet experience by reading the paper, listening to npr, and watching headline news all at the same time - when the phone rang. it was my new internet liaison, a subversive web designer who answers only to the name rotten. i paid for rotten's isp account, and, in exchange, he maintained my web site and collected email from its growing readership. a sample:from: asham@batel.com.bhsubject: hidate: thu, 21 may 1998 08:49:16 +0300hi i'm khalil one of the arab who would like to be the best in all.. i don't think that you understand what i mean but i really want to be the best. and i'll be be be be be be be be be be be be be be that. i just wanted to contect you and to make kind of friendship with you. i know that you are busy and you are not given any face to some ones just like me, but i really want to be a good friend if you just sind me a letter to conferm me that you are ready to be a friend or just to say hi or any thing you like. i'm 18 and i'm in bahrain in the arabian gulf. in the end i hope you more hack and good bye. i'm waiting on a fire for the replay.rotten also kept me posted on breaking news. in mid-may, he said, \"hey, did you hear? mitnick lost his appeal.\"of course, i hadn't heard. kevin mitnick was the subject of takedown, the book by computer-security expert tsutomu shimomura and new york times reporter john markoff, which painstakingly documented the electronic pursuit and capture of \"america's most wanted computer outlaw.\" at the time of the takedown bust in 1995, mitnick was already on supervised release for having hacked into a dec computer system a few years earlier. and with a prior conviction on his record, he wasn't likely to receive any form of leniency.rotten faxed me the three-page ruling, which was emblazoned \"not for publication.\" the ninth circuit court of appeals found that banishing mitnick from the online world was \"no more restrictive than necessary\": whenever he's ultimately released from prison, he'll be barred from using computers, the internet, and cell phones, and from offering advice to computer users - absent the written approval of his probation officer. and unlike me, mitnick will be specifically forbidden to interact with computers through a third party - a restriction that means he may not be allowed any net presence, not even a web site. (mitnick's criminal trial is set for january 19, 1999.)meanwhile, the internet invasion continued. there were terminals in libraries and airports, and url-saturated tv commercials and print advertisements everywhere. i noticed many dropped the \"http://\" about a year ago, and some were starting to omit the \"www\" as well. domain names like amazon.com and etrade had become household words. the radio constantly asked, \"do you yahoo!?\" somewhere along the line i missed that \"yahoo\" had become a verb.but i was adjusting, learning to blend. my fax machine had become my lifeline. my desk was covered with curled, yellowing scrolls of thermal paper - tiny rivulets from the ocean of information beyond my horizon. i had people i could call to explain the mysterious new jargon that was constantly washing ashore from the net. i now screened my calls.the accursed question \"what's your email address?\" came up even more than ever before. now, without shame, i responded, \"i'm not on the internet.\" when they asked \"why?\" or \"how is that possible?\" i didn't bother to explain. i just smiled and said, \"check out my web site.\"epilogue: my po has decided to end my electronic exile. with my probation scheduled to expire in june, he reasons that my first tentative steps onto the net should take place under his supervision - not later, when my debt to society is fully paid off. until then, however, one thing hasn't changed - he'll still be reviewing my phone bills to ensure that i dial in only to a major isp and not some telephone company's switching-control center.to my surprise, i feel a rush of anxiety upon first hearing the news. after finally growing comfortable with my offliner status, i have no idea what my first untethered day on the internet might bring - there's so much catching up to do, and so many possible places to start. just like that day more than two years ago when i stood outside the suburban minimall, i'm poised at the gates of freedom. and once again, i find myself wondering, where do i go from here?"}
