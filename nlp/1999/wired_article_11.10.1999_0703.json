(wired strategies is not affiliated with wired news or wired digital).\"we're not disappointed at not being invited since aol specifically said this meeting was not about the tos issue,\" wired strategies' president john aravosis said. \"but i would hope that it is not a substitute for an in-depth meeting about their tos policy.\"most of the groups who attended the meeting are not specifically focused on internet issues.\"it is particularly important to speak with organizations like wired strategies because we have a lot of data on complaints,\" said aravosis. a substantive discussion on content policies will require participants who are knowledgeable about it, he said.glaad will also continue to press for the inclusion of groups like wired strategies in future meetings on the subject.\"we will advocate to ensure that aol is listening to smart and informed voices,\" garry said.the goodwill generated by tuesday's meeting will be tested in the weeks to come. most civil rights groups are waiting to see if aol's actions will match its warm rhetoric.\"we will have to wait and see what happens,\" hatewatch president david goldman said. \"what happens over the next few weeks will be a better indicator of what the result will be of this initial encounter.\"\"aol will be judged on how it ultimately responds to our concerns, how vocal they will be about their commitment to our community,\" said garry."}
