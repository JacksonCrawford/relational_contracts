(how many horror movies get an r rating just for language?) the evil is in the shadows, leaving piles of rocks and sticks and stick figures hanging from trees.the scary part is watching the characters' psychological meltdown. blair witch owes more to samuel beckett and waiting for godot than wes craven and nightmare on elm street.to make it more believable that tape kept rolling until the end, heather clings to her camera like a teddy bear. she ignores her friends complaints to \"turn that thing off,\" and that \"you're still making a documentary,\" as things get bleaker. their arguing and cursing gets wilder as the insanity increases.the blair witch is said to have wiped out half the children of blair, maryland, back in the late 1700s, causing the residents to flee. the area was reincorporated years later as burkittsville and seven of the town's children were ritualistically murdered in 1941.blair witch becomes unbelievable at one point with the brief appearance of a villainess, a bible-toting old woman named mary brown. the trio meet her before they leave for the forest and she spins a few crazy yarns. she looks too much like a b horror spook and briefly drags the picture down.\"method filmmaking\" is a low-budget moviemaker's dream, and it works, except that most of the improvisation is simply a mess of bickering and bantering with a nasty ending. working without a script and skeletal direction, all donahue, leonard, and williams can do is argue incessantly. one must force oneself to believe that these college kids filmed their own doom or the film becomes a long trip toward the inevitable."}
