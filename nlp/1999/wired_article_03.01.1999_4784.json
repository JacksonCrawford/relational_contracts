(mmx is included on all three chips.) it assists with integer calculations typically used for compression and decompression of video.priceas of january, the pentium ii was priced from $181 (333 mhz) to $562 (450 mhz). with the processor being phased out this year, there are no second-quarter prices yet.celeronclock speed300 to 400 mhzthe 366-mhz celeron is only 5 to 10 percent slower than an equivalent pentium ii. it packs 128k of onboard cache (storage space built onto the processor), which is more efficient than the pentium ii's 512k of closely coupled cache. for web surfing and wordprocessing, the celeron's plenty speedy.  instruction setthe celeron uses the same instruction set as the pentium ii. but next year, intel will introduce the pentium iii instruction set to celeron for a souped-up but still reasonably priced chip.multimedia enhancementslike the others, celeron has the mmx instruction set, designed to run video, graphics, and game apps.pricethe celeron costs $123; analysts expect a drop to $85 by q2. there's no point in dumping your pentium ii until the celeron includes the pentium iii instruction set (see above); then consider the as yet unannounced 500- or 600-mhz celerons.pentium iiiclock speed450 or 500 mhzalthough the new processor makes very little difference when running applications not designed for it, many of tomorrow's coolest apps will need the pentium iii (or amd's similar 3dnow! chip) to run properly. and if the speedy 500 mhz just isn't enough for you, wait until the second half of the year, when intel will shrink the die size to 0.18 microns to build a 600-mhz version. experts believe that by year's end intel will be well on its way to producing a 1-ghz processor.  instruction setthe pentium iii couples its own instruction set with the pentium ii's. the new set enables software developers to represent objects as mathematical equations and easily translate these into images. the new chip processes up to 2 billion floating-point calculations per second, double that of the fastest pentium ii. and because such calculations are used for speech synthesis and pattern/voice recognition, the pentium iii is a better chip for handling encryption.multimedia enhancementsthe secret to the pentium iii's blazingly fast multimedia is the new instruction set's 70 simd (single instruction multiple data) extensions for floating-point data types. the pentium iii provides more realistic graphics with smoother surfaces, as well as real-time rendering of shadows and reflections.pricethe 450-mhz pentium iii processor costs $496, the 500-mhz version $696. prices are expected to drop fast, reaching $350 and $530 by the second half of the year."}
