instead of vying against each other in the marketplace with better products, customer support, or marketing campaigns, companies will instead have to fight the slow-moving trench warfare customary inside regulatory agencies.that means hiring lobbyists and writing more checks to politicians. it also means starting groups mirrored on the national association of broadcasters or the us telecom association.it's already happening. by all accounts, microsoft's political giving jumped soon after the doj resumed its antitrust action in late 1997. the company began to hire more lobbyists, too, and moved its dc political office from suburban maryland to downtown washington.dc's political class sure isn't complaining about the additional cash flowing into the city, especially since competitors like sun and america online may feel compelled to match microsoft.but few people would say this is a compelling \u2013 or even, truth be told, interesting \u2013 way for the pc revolution to end. who wants the memory of a fiercely competitive computer industry to go the way of bell bottoms?"}
