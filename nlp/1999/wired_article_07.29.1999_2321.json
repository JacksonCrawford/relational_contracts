followed by free computers. what's next? free commercial software -- with a catch, of course. by leander kahney.", "author": "leander kahney", "category": "science", "type": "article", "timestamp":

you have to look at ads while using it.zdnet is offering a range of financial, entertainment, education, and internet applications, as well as games and utilities featuring web-like banner ads or buy-now buttons.with zdnet among the software distributors on board and several companies providing technology to burrow ads within shareware, the concept will likely gain ground rapidly.shareware authoring has generally been perceived as a calling pursued for love rather than money. independent developers find a niche, create a utility, and rely on the goodwill of users to generate revenue.while some packages simply ask people to send a donation to the author, many offer time-limited versions or lite copies with key features disabled.but thanks to the internet and the support of advertisers, shareware authors are now giving away software for free.according to attendees, the buzz at last week's annual shareware industry conference in tampa, florida, was about the companies that make ads-in-software possible, which includes aureate media, conducent technologies, and netjumper.com.though no hard data has been collected, the association of shareware professionals estimates that only a fraction of users pay for their shareware. it depends on the application, but payment rates can be as low as 2 percent and as high as 50 percent.\"in the past, developers would throw their products out there in the hope that people would pay for them,\" said richard holler, executive director of the asp. \"i would say [ad-supported software] is going to be very popular in a year or so.\"\"i believe ad-supported shareware is going to be a component of the marketing plans of any software business,\" said yermo lamers, ceo of dtlink software of college park, maryland, publisher of personal stock manager, a portfolio management package.using technology from conducent, dtlink's personal stock manager features web-like banner ads in the button bar.applications that use conducent's technology typically feature ads linked to appropriate web sites. the ads rotate every 30 seconds.applications detect when the user is online and periodically download new ads to the user's machine. ads are displayed whether or not the machine is connected to the net.conducent's technology also allows shareware authors to add net functions like searches, email, chat, and e-commerce buttons to their applications.ad revenue is proportional to the number of hits generated. revenues are split between conducent, the developer, and the distributor.advertisers also benefit, said bob regular, conducent's director of content development.regular said click-through rates on shareware ads average 30 percent.dtlink's lamers said the revenue potential is comparable to selling software the traditional shareware way. however, some authors are more successful than others, he said. lamers has heard of someone pulling down a seven-figure income from shareware ads.while he likes getting money from ads, lamers said branding opportunities are far more valuable.using conducent's technology, dtlink, a three-person operation, gets to co-brand its software with companies like reuters.\"that's what i really like about the conducent model,\" lamers said. \"it gets brand association for our shareware with some big brand portal names.... co-branding has brought us incredible benefits.\"in addition to zdnet, conducent has signed with some other big software distributors, including lycos (wired news' parent company), go2net, xoom, reality online, winsite, and rocket download.the company so far has agreements with about 25 developers, which include 40 applications.by contrast, click-throughs on web-banner ads are down to 0.61 percent in june, according to nielsen media research.\"the web is so cluttered with advertising, the user is desensitized,\" regular said. \"it's just become wallpaper.\"regular said conducent's high click rates are a result of reaching very targeted audiences.\"[the ads] are much more effective because the user is much more engaged,\" he said. \"for example, financial management software carries ads for etrade or schwab. what could make more sense?\"according to regular, ads-in-software is just getting started and will rapidly gain momentum.\"it's the culture of the net,\" he said. \"everyone wants everything for free.... the next step in the process is software for free. soon the whole experience will be free.\"peggy o'neill, senior internet analyst with nielsen media research, said she was impressed by the 30 percent click-through rate claimed by conducent.\"applications are very specific. they're more specific in many cases than web pages and web sites,\" she said. \"going out to the folks that want to reach these guys makes sense.... all you have to do is put up with ads.\"however, she said, users may eventually find the ads distracting and annoying. she also questioned the appeal of shareware's small niche markets for advertisers."}
