the europeans are doing their best to catch up. steve kettmann reports from berlin.", "author": "steve kettmann", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "12.15.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "berlin -- even in the old countries of europe, where the holiday season pushes people to outdoor markets for mulled wine and candied apples, internet buying has had a major impact on christmas shopping habits. \"there is much more activity compared to last year,\" said richard maul, managing director of online marketing for the german company pixelpark. \"i think by christmas next year we will probably have the same activities we see in the united states this year.\"we still have a lot of activities going on, but actually most of them happened pretty late, even november and december, so there was not enough time to take advantage of the holiday season,\" maul said. \"several clients asked us to develop e-commerce sites, but for several clients it was too late to have that implemented, because they started far too late. we had to say no to a lot of people.\"great britain and germany are leading the way, along with the computer-saturated scandinavian countries. but even in the european countries that have been slower to embrace computers, like italy, web sites are popping up to take advantage of holiday shoppers' insatiable appetites for convenience.\"he who gives tuscan wine as a present is a lover of the classic and the absolute,\" proclaims the special natale/2000 section of vino please, a bilingual italian wine site.comparisons with american buying habits are telling. overall last year, europeans spent us$1.2 billion online, out of $1.9 trillion in total retail sales. americans hit the \"buy now\" button to the tune of $8 billion, against $2.6 trillion in retail sales, according to forrester research. but europe seems to be trying hard to catch up, especially the british.\"what we're seeing basically is a lot of venture capital that appeared in the uk at the end of last year is not only stimulating the home-grown capital market, but also making funds available for firms to launch e-commerce services,\" said mike butcher, editor of new media age.\"there's a scramble going on, particularly for christmas. it's quite a different market than a year ago. there are also a reasonable number of me-too sites that are using models pioneered over in the states. quite a few european ventures realize that if they launch before the us sites realize there is a market over here, they will be the movers, before a comparable us firm moves into europe.\"companies have to take local tendencies into consideration. according to forrester, germans buy books online twice as often as the dutch, and the british buy airline tickets online twice as often as the swedes. then there are the french, who are the least likely \"to buy online at all.\"that's why tps, one of two satellite tv operators in france, has done its best to get people to shop virtually -- without using the computer.\"more than half our subscribers use our shopping channel, which in december has five interactive shops,\" said company spokeswoman alexandra sohet. \"every shop we have makes special offers for christmas.\"sohet herself buys concert tickets and cds over the internet, but has not tried christmas shopping yet. she summed up why many in france might prefer to shop via interactive tv.\"it's even easier,\" she said. \"you don't have to worry about turning on the pc or waiting for it to warm up or getting an internet connection. you don't even have to move from your spot on the sofa. you just use the remote and do it in one minute.\"but overall trends in europe, especially northern europe, put it on track to mimic us buying patterns. the main brake on the shift comes from such factors as the smaller percentage of people using credit cards in germany which, with 80 million people, is europe's largest market. \"in the us, typically the holiday season is a large proportion of spending, often as high as 40 percent of the yearly total if you count the last two months of the year as the holiday period,\" said evan neufeld, vice president of international research for london-based jupiter communications.\"this year, you'll see a similar concentration of spending in the holiday period, that is, the last two months of the year,\" he said. \"the pure volume of eu citizens who shop online grows exponentially. we've been talking about european e-commerce for, like, six years. the market is certainly reaching that critical mass where online retail is a serious arena where people are spending money, not just a blip as it was in past seasons.\"but as in the united states, it's not as if people go out and buy computers just so they can shop. holiday flurries of e-commerce are just part of a larger overall picture in which people get used to shopping online. that, of course, is a function of how many go online at all.jupiter estimates that even sweden, europe's leader in household online penetration with 31.6 percent, still lags behinds the united states (41.1 percent). the other scandinavian countries are right behind sweden, and germany follows with a penetration of 19.9 percent. nearly 18 percent of britains are online while jupiter, backing up the findings of forrester, reports that only 8.9 percent of french households own a computer.\"people make the conclusion that europe will be nearly as developed [as the united states] on the internet by 2003, but really it's more complicated than that,\" said neufeld.\"holiday shopping is a significant factor in driving the increase, but it also has to do with general trends and day-to-day habits. i don't think people are coming online just to shop during the holidays. i think they come online before and the holidays are a catalyst to increase wallet share.\"that's why companies like procter & gamble might really be the main players. rahul chakkara, procter & gamble's brussels-based interactive marketing manager for europe, said that his company did not see a big boom in business during the holidays.\"we sell everyday household goods,\" he said. \"i don't think people are going to buy more detergents because of the holiday season. it would be fair to say that europe is still around a year-and-a-half to two years behind the united states. but that's diminishing. by the end of next year, we might be much closer to the us.\"even though we are a couple of years behind, e-commerce in europe is catching up quickly.\""}
