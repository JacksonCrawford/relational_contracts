manhattan's already been plastered with stickers and posters, and a dance track for mtv is in the works.click tracker: privacy advocates harrumphed about the comet cursor, a simple animated mouse pointer that transmits a record of the visit to the software's designer. much ado about nothing, replied the company. after all, while an id number is collected, it gets no names, email addresses, or other identification information to match the number to.powering down: so it's finally happened -- hardware processing power has outstripped the needs of the software that runs on it. as analyst keith diefendorff put it, \"a lot of people are asking if they need a 750 mhz processor to access the web.\" that said, diefendorff added the day will come when \"applications will catch up with us and we will return to a place where we need more processing power.\"the vc game: former san francisco 49ers harris barton and ronnie lott unveiled champion ventures, a $40 million tech venture capital fund financed by big-name pro athletes, including dan marino, jerry rice, steve young, and barry bonds. the athletes' cash will be funneled into 10 of the valley's most prestigious vcs -- funds a million investors would kill to get a piece of.going black: wednesday was a day without art, with more than 100 artists, organizations, and red-ribbon wearers at large posting black screens to the web so visitors will \"think about the black hole that aids has left in our cultural lives.\"more than talk: wireless industry types said they'll need text-based web browsers -- delivering real-time stock quotes and improving access to news, weather forecasts, and e-commerce -- to stay afloat in the ultra-competitive telecom marketplace. \"for this to become the center of the universe, it can no longer be just about voice,\" said sprint pcs's keith paglusch, just one of many wireless execs who gathered at the cdma america's congress.dvd's next move: sonic solutions demonstrated dvd-building software that makes creating video discs that work on any player as easy as arranging audio and video clips on the screen. this sort of thing could be the next move for corporations backing the already-successful dvd format and hoping to expand the market further.living in the past: had a problem getting an ad for your web site into the local paper? not to worry, said kevin mccourt, director of online classifieds for the newspaper association of america. he insisted newspapers will get over their fear of cheap, one-line ads that simply give a url. after all, they did with 1-800 numbers years ago.not-so-boss rules: citing unspecified email-policy violations, the new york times company fired 23 employees at a virginia center that processes company invoices, paychecks, and benefits. and yep, they can do that; company policies restricting email don't infringe on constitutional rights because companies are private institutions.timing is everything: got a lot of stock options that haven't yet vested? you might want to ponder the case of reporter tom taulli. he sued former employer go2net, charging that he was wrongfully fired days before the company secured a major investment by microsoft co-founder paul allen -- an investment that would have made his pending stock options hugely valuable.the real world: celebrity parents and children, plus several local schoolchildren, got together at apple hq in cupertino to learn how easy it was to create short digital movies with imacs and canon camcorders. everybody had a ball. but when it was over, the rich and famous went home with the demo equipment -- and the poorer children turned theirs over to their schools.it's good for you, that's why: experian vp marty abrams defended the idea that his company can collect oodles of your personal info, store it in perpetuity, and then re-sell it to people you don't know. his argument? that the free exchange of information is key to growing the economy. in fact, europe has lagged behind the united states, he said, largely because it heavily regulates what data firms can collect.doing what politicians do: the senate republican high-tech task force descended upon holly oak elementary school in san jose to talk up their support for a multimillion dollar initiative called powerup, which aims to put computers into classrooms around the country. but the pols had votes on their minds too, according to utah's bob bennett, who said his goal was to establish a dialogue with industry types to further the gop's cause.at what price: telco mogul craig mccaw was reportedly close to making a major investment in the bankrupt iridium satellite phone system. the key questions remaining were how little iridium would be willing to accept for the 66-satellite constellation it spent billions to construct -- and how much investors would be willing to pay for the high-maintenance network that will require hundreds of millions of dollars a year to run.low-rent district: montblanc said it asked its authorized retailers to remove pictures of its products from their web sites and to stop selling its pens online. seems the internet just isn't classy enough for such a high-class product. or as a montblanc exec put it, \"luxury by its very nature is not ubiquitous ...
