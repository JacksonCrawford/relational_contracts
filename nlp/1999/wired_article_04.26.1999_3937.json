[genes are] not always turned on at the same time or in the same amounts. whether they're turned on or off can tell us a lot about the process in the cells,\" said david smoller, president of genome systems.while gene-processing technology has been around since 1997, the gene discovery array has made it more accessible to a wider range of researchers, smoller said. \"this is a consumer product made for the broad scientific community. [it] was an effort to try to reach small and large labs; it\ufffds more of a tool for the masses.\"three of the 13 genes identified are known and have already been sequenced. the other 10 are expressed sequence tags, meaning they have been previously identified but not fully sequenced.the next step, ljubimova said, is to sequence the unknown genes, a process that may take more than a year, depending on the size of the gene. next, scientists will characterize the genes by deciphering their behavior and its effects.most current cancer studies focus on the genetic differences between malignant tissue and normal tissue. but ljubimova plans to compare tissue from different \"grades\" of tumors to find clues to how cancer spreads. cancerous tumors are graded from 0 to 4, with grade 4 being the most likely to spread.\"we plan to understand how they\ufffdre specific for brain tumors. maybe they\ufffdre important for different cancers as well.... the disease has a lot of similar functions in spite of the fact that [it might be in] a different organ,\" ljubimova said.ljubimova hopes the research will lead to drug technologies, called antisense, that would prevent the synthesis of unwanted proteins.\"using different technologies such as antisense, we can [possibly] block the gene and maybe prevent the growth of cancer,\" she said."}
