[agro management was] willing to warrant our engines if they failed because of the oil, so we didn't think we ran a large liability by trying it.\"michigan was a natural spot for a trial run as it is an agricultural hotbed with leading crops such as soybeans and canola. it is also the home of detroit, the automaking capital of the country. influential agriculture groups around the state and legislative bodies pushed for the deal to go through.a fleet system such as the post office's is optimal for trying out the veggie crankcase lubricant, allen said. \"it's the quickest market entry, and it's a well-maintained system that offers rigorous over-the-road testing.\"the postal system is buying the stuff for about us$2 a quart, or roughly double what a regular petroleum-based oil would cost.\"the cost will not be a problem when you weigh all the ancillary benefits of this,\" allen said, adding the price will drop with volume, setting the product apart from predecessors.\"there are biodegradable oils out there, but they are hard to find and cost about $15 a quart,\" he said.high price tags have prevented other alternative resources such as bio-diesel -- which costs three to four times more than regular diesel -- from excelling in the marketplace.\"it's more expensive, so [bio-diesel is] not making the splash one would want it to,\" said scientist gerhard knothe of the ars national center for agriculture utilization research.availability is also a common problem. \"you're not going to get [bio-diesel] at the service station around the corner. it's for niche markets where environmental concerns are a priority.\"previous attempts to lube engines with vegetable oils have consisted of additives to petroleum-based oil. but amg 2000 \"improves upon the prior art by providing a liquid lubricant that is composed principally of vegetable-based components,\" the patent reads.the inventors of amg 2000 herald the reusable facet of their product.\"after you drain it from the crankcase, you can use it for other applications such as spreader oils, bar chain oils, dust suppressors, etc.,\" allen said.amg 2000 would replace crude petroleum, a non-renewable natural resource that is regularly dumped indiscriminately after being drained from internal combustion engines.copyright"}
