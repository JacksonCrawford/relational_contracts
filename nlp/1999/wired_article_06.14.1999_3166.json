"text": "in the low-tech world of convenience stores, where many mom-and-pop managers still keep handwritten sales records, your neighborhood 7-eleven is taking a leap into the digital age. the world's largest chain of convenience stores, which operates, franchises, and licenses more than 18,000 shops globally, is planting a computerized heart in all its 5,600 locations in the united states and canada.dubbed the retail information system, it is a high-speed computer network for managing each store's inventory of about 2,500 items, from beer and cigarettes to milk and doughnuts.modeled on a successful japanese system, it goes beyond record-keeping to help store managers predict what fickle consumers will want tomorrow by tracking which items sell best -- or worst -- and adding in weather forecasts and schedules of local events.\"we think this is a quantum leap,\" 7-eleven inc. executive vice president and chief operating officer jim keyes told reuters at the company's dallas headquarters. \"prior to this we were one notch above cigar boxes,\" he said.the information system is part of a broader transformation at 7-eleven that has caught the eye of financial analysts.analysts say the information system, being installed this year, gives 7-eleven a competitive edge in the convenience store business, which has lagged far behind other sectors in adopting information technology to streamline operations.\"it'll help them increase the number of best-selling products in stores and reduce the amount of labor in inventory work,\" said dennis telzrow of dallas-based brokerage hoak breedlove wesneski.telzrow has had a buy recommendation on the stock since late last year. salomon smith barney has it as an outperform. the third brokerage with published recommendations, ladenburg thalmann & co., ranks it as a hold.7-eleven's stock has long underperformed the market, languishing at less than us$3 and hitting a 12-month low of $1.38 three times in february and march. it is now at about $2.19 on the nasdaq system.7-eleven hopes to perk up the stock price by boosting sales with the retail information system and a series of related changes since the mid-1990s aimed at streamlining operations and attracting more customers.the computer network ties in with many of those improvements, including new centralized distribution centers and automated accounting. some 200 outside vendors also have been hooked up with the system in order to improve the timing and reliability of deliveries.keyes said results so far are encouraging from the 3,600 of 5,600 north american stores where the information system is running. the rest are due to receive the system by year's end.\"those areas have been running in excess of 10 percent sales increase this year, in fact i think 13 to 14 percent, while the rest of the stores are running 7 to 8 percent increases,\" keyes said.the power of the information system lies in the exact feedback it gives managers on how each item sells, keyes said.previously, each store kept records of sales in terms of dollar volume but had no way to track inventory item by item.now, every product sold, from a butane lighter to a newspaper, is identified by a bar code or punch entry at the computerized cash register. the information is collected in the back office by a desktop computer and shared with regional and national headquarters over a dedicated network of high-speed data lines.special software applications developed for 7-eleven allow managers to sort the data at the level of the individual store, region or nationwide, generating a detailed breakdown of which flavor of tortilla chips sells best and what products do not.\"before, you didn't really know what was selling. you saw an empty spot on the shelf and you filled it,\" said jeffrey lindsey, manager of a 7-eleven in the corporate headquarters building.the value of the data was proven by a first run in texas at the start of the year.the neatly printed tables showed that 90 percent of sales were generated by just 15 percent of products, implying that a lot of valuable shelf space was wasted on slow movers that could be replaced by more popular items.\"it was pretty shocking,\" keyes said. \"we had guessed that something like 50 percent of our inventory was slow and really it was 80 percent-plus that was slow. it presents just a tremendous opportunity to improve sales.\"7-eleven introduces about 50 new items a week in its stores and the new data stream means it can see exactly how they sell, allowing stores to fine-tune their supply to local demand.\"convenience retailing means we've got to change on a daily basis to be responsive to whatever you convenience needs are, which changes all the time, and in the absence of information it's just guesswork,\" keyes said.for the store manager, the system also offers a weather forecast for the week ahead from the national weather service and an electronic notepad for keeping track of local events or holidays that could influence what consumers buy.when something is about to run out, the system triggers the store manager or franchisee to think about external factors like tomorrow's weather or the football game scheduled tomorrow night,\" keyes said.the system is a proprietary development by 7-eleven in cooperation with several software and hardware companies including computer services giant electronic data systems (eds), dallas-based affiliated computer services and ncr, along with japan's nec corporation.it is based on a system developed by seven-eleven japan, an independently operated licensee with more than 7,600 stores that, together with major japanese retailer ito-yokado, controls 65 percent of 7-eleven.keyes said he believes the system can help raise its sales rates closer to those of seven-eleven japan, where stores turn over their entire inventory about 48 times a year, as against 12 times on average at 7-eleven in north america.\"they've been able to be so efficient with their stores that they're running literally double the sales volume through half the square feet,\" keyes said.copyright"}
