because the alt-pop trio cleverly cops nearly every sound ever made by these musicians. in fact, listening to this album is like a pop-music crash course.the catchy \"army\" tempo-shifts from ivory-pounding broadway bombast to witty slacker ode (\"well i thought about the army / dad said 'son, you're fuckin' high'\"). \"narcolepsy\" weaves between dreamy pop minuet and arena-ready progrock. but pretty as it all is, one yearns for a song that doesn't sound so borrowed. like many unauthorized biographies, this disc has the feel of a well-done clip job.street credroom serviceorganize in stereoa time to gromany unhappy returnsthe wrath of youking of lost vegastouchscreens are betterurban legendmusicjust outta betareadmehere to reternitynatural selectionexquisite computingno village idiothigh dramacontributors"}
