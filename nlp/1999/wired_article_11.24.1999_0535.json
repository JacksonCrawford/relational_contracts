(csa hosted a meeting with their riarc counterparts in june 1999 to draft a position paper.)csa's summary prepared for the unesco summit repeatedly cites a controversial july 1999 report prepared by another un agency -- the united nations development program. the undp report \"particularly draws attention to the reality of this split in the matter of access to the internet,\" csa says.but in the united states, many internet users -- and even some members of congress -- complained about the undp report's recommendation that rich countries tax internet usage at about one us cent per 100 email messages.the idea isn't new. an expert group convened by the european commission has recommended a \"bit tax\" on all online communications.the unesco paris summit runs from 30 november through 1 december."}
