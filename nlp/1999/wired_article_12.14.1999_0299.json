can we use light for a show when mr. speer also used light for a show? is it morally right? or should we stop all light shows?'\"it's true that the nazis eagerly embraced technology, in the propaganda arena as well as on the battlefield.germany was the first nation to use jet fighters in combat, and its v1 and v2 rockets were the ancestors of the modern icbms. ironically, they failed to develop an atomic bomb, a weapon that was never taken seriously by hitler, according to scholars.but the nazis were innovators on the propaganda battlefield as well.in devising his dramatic effect for one of the nuremberg rallies, speer hit on the idea of arranging more than a 100 spotlights in a huge circle, then pointing them straight up into the night sky. the result was chilling, aptly described by neville henderson, then britain's ambassador to germany, as a \"cathedral of ice.\""}
