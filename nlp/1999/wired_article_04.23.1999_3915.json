violent videogames? fantasy role-playing? reports began to hint, then baldly assert, that technology caused the violence.would-be pundits on cnn and msnbc warned not to let teens online, and one criminologist claimed that \"the key to this case is the internet.\" the folks at cybersitter, makers of perhaps the least efficient of the web-blocking software packages, seized on the tragedy as an excuse to sell newly nervous parents on the virtues of their product.the public seemed to buy the explanation. over half of americans polled say the internet was at least partly responsible for the shooting. in a cnn/usa today poll conducted wednesday, 64 percent of the respondents said the net contributed to the tragedy. only 11 percent said there was no link, and tv programs, movies and music also got blamed.a corollary to the idea of technology causing violence is, of course, that one can get rid of violence by getting rid of the tech. within hours, politicians began trying to figure out how. sen. dianne feinstein, hardly a fan of the first amendment, said she believed the internet was responsible. it was time to ban bomb-making information online, the california democrat said during a senate judiciary hearing ostensibly devoted to online privacy. the panel's chairman, orrin hatch, worried aloud about the dangers of children playing acclaim entertainment's shadowman, a game in which the player slays serial killers.trying to shield vulnerable members of society from disruptive influences is a response as old as humanity itself. circa 500 bc, the greek philosopher anaxgoras was tossed in a dungeon after claiming that the gods were mythical abstractions, not reality. a jury in 1852 convicted a franciscan friar of burning a king james bible in violation of irish law.but this week's internet finger-pointing was directed not just at the information out there, but the medium that transmitted it.\"when the news came out about the school shootings, i said, 'when will the internet be linked?'\" said mike godwin, author of cyber-rights. \"i could predict what the issues would be: there would be guns, youth culture, and the internet. there would probably be some type of temptation on the part of congress to regulate bomb-making information.\"whether it's bomb-making instructions, pornography, or violent movies, linking the media to mayhem has become a popular american pastime. \"its psychological roots are complex and deep. politicians and direct-mail fundraisers love it: they can wax indignant about images and symbols, gain headlines, dollars, and votes, without having done anything serious to address our social problems,\" marjorie heins, author of sex, sin, and blasphemy said in a 1994 article.congress' reaction this week is not new. in congressional hearings in 1952, mental health experts from the mayo clinic blamed delinquency on tv \"murder, violence, shooting, hanging, kidnapping, and the doings of wicked witches.\" laboratory studies in the 1960s -- since called into question -- seemed to confirm that violent films or cartoons led to violent behavior. bowing to government pressure, comic book manufacturers ginned up a self-censorship scheme that banned \"lurid, unsavory, gruesome illustrations\" and characters such as werewolves, ghouls, and vampires. once again this week, the macabre is being blamed. some reports said harris and klebold were fans of the vampire role-playing game, and their goth-like affectations contributed to speculation. articles uncritically quoted the speculation of police.reported the san francisco chronicle: \"the game -- vampire, the masquerade -- i call it dungeons and dragons on steroids,\" [sgt. dave williams] said, adding that players assume the persona of vampires and act out attacks.role-players were quick to rebut williams' statement.\"no one acts out *anything* in an rpg. it's all sitting around a table rolling dice,\" complained one veteran gamer in a post to a mailing list.white wolf, which manufactures vampire: the masquerade, denied rumors that its product was linked to the deaths. \"our games provide a creative outlet for the imaginations adults and young adults who want to create fictional stories and settings,\" the firm said in a statement.white wolf has good reason to worry. when three students were slain in a similar shooting in paducah, kentucky, their parents blamed pornographic web sites, videogames, and violent movies. last week they filed a $100 million lawsuit against a number of computer companies and media firms, claiming that the executives traded conscience for cash. lawyers predict the families of the 15 murdered students in this week's slaying will do the same thing.would such lawsuits succeed? probably not. similar suits in the past have had little success. in 1981, hustler published an article -- part of a series about taboo sexual practices -- on autoerotic asphyxia. an appeals court said hustler couldn't be held responsible for the death of a boy who found the magazine and tested the theory.another appeals court in 1990 ruled the manufacturer of the popular dungeons & dragons role-playing game was not responsible for a young customer's suicide. but experts say when a corporation is sued, it may opt to settle out of court rather than fighting a legal battle against such sympathetic plaintiffs.if the internet and games didn't make the littleton shooters so angry, what did? \"whatever is the popular media in the youth culture is blamed for violence or criminal behavior by teenagers,\" said barry steinhardt, associate director of the american civil liberties union.\"there's a natural human tendency to look for someone to blame and to look for explanation of what is inexplicable and unthinkable.\""}
