[a] church is supposed to be there for spiritual redemption and i'm freaking scared of them?\"the man, who goes by the alias safe, said that it's a catch-22 situation: he can keep at&t from revealing his identity by arguing against the subpoena in court. but if he chooses to argue in court, he must identify himself. if he doesn't argue the subpoena, at&t will be forced to comply and will reveal his name to the scientologists.the church of scientology is notorious for litigation to protect its copyrighted works. critics like keith henson, an engineer from palo alto, california, who criticized the group in online newsgroups, have found themselves the subject of lawsuits after posting parts of the group's doctrines. but that's not the worst of it.henson said that, in addition to filing suit against him in 1996, the church has picketed various companies where he has worked as a consultant, hung up posters defaming him, and posted web sites critical of his actions.ava paquette, an attorney for the church who filed the subpoena for safe's identity, declined any comment on the latest case, other than to say that safe had violated bridge's copyright, and that it was a serious matter.\"it's a legal action that's ongoing. it's between me, at&t, and the subscriber,\" she said."}
