released, the warring sides \u2013 microsoft and the us government \u2013 can really get down to the business of duking it out over money and power. but that means that everybody else \u2013 the armchair spectators, the bill gates haters, and the free-market lovers \u2013 will get in on the tussle over judge thomas penfield jackson's landmark decision too.also:judge jackson's findings of factjudge: 'gates was main culprit'judge lowers boom on msmicrosoft keeps its dukes upwho thinks what about thatms: heavy trading, heavy talkus v. microsoft: timelineongoing us v. microsoft coveragenicholas provenzo, the 30-year-old director of the center for the moral defense of capitalism \u2013 a nonprofit that supports \"laissez-faire capitalism\" \u2013 was \"absolutely disgusted\" with the outcome.\"the essence of the finding is that extraordinary success in business is dangerous and must be stopped,\" provenzo said. \"and it's a notice to creators and achievers that condemnation and punishment is a reward if they get too successful.\"provenzo has been waging a personal campaign against the \"philosophical errors that are antitrust laws\" for nearly two years, and he is concerned that judge jackson's finding could set the tone for many battles to come.hours before it became official that findings of fact would be issued friday, provenzo was already faxing press releases, denouncing antitrust laws, and plugging his pro-microsoft stance on his web site.\"it's a moral outrage,\" he said. \"this whole case against microsoft is about the fact that they're just too dang successful. microsoft should be saluted for its achievements, not punished.\"as news of the decision spread, armchair warriors on both sides of the issue continued to sharpen knives in preparation for the next phase of the high-tech holy war.the finding came as no surprise to j. mike washe, head of the break-up microsoft grassroots movement. \"some of the issues in the trial are so blatant i couldn't see it going any other way,\" he said.washe said the \"overwhelming email evidence\" was one factor that clinched the decision. however, he did suffer a few tense moments toward the end of the day. \"i was afraid that this was going to be another o.j. trial where justice would not be served, but i'm pretty happy,\" he said.meanwhile, provenzo has set up a faq section on the center's web site that explains in detail aspects of trial testimony, antitrust law, and economic theory regarding the case.he has also set up a \"petition against the persecution of microsoft\" that will be sent to members of congress, attorney general janet reno, and president bill clinton in the event of a finding against the redmond giant.the petition has garnered the signatures of 15,000 like-minded citizens who believe that the antitrust case against the world's wealthiest man is unjust.\"people are saying microsoft is forcing people to buy its products,\" provenzo said. \"no, they have to persuade people to buy their products. as long they don\u2019t have a gun backing up their argument, they have to persuade people.\"while provenzo said he expects today's outcome to be grim, he is still hoping for a decision in favor of \"economic freedom.\"\"antitrust is all about shackling successful producers in the name of the competitors,\" he said. \"these things should be defended \u2013 people say america is a great country because we're free, but they have no concept of what that freedom is based on.\"provenzo, with his anti-antitrust, pro-microsoft sentiment, looks to be on a rather lonely crusade. the net is rife with anti-bill gates articles and web sites, including the anti-microsoft association, the boycott microsoft site, and, of course, the bill gates is satan page.and all of these ardent bill-haters have something to say about the outcome of friday's decision.jamie love, director of the center for study of responsive law, a nonprofit ralph nader organization, expected adverse findings for microsoft because, he says, it deserves it.\"he turned the net into a colossal surveillance machine that just tries to suck money out of people's pockets,\" he said. \"they\u2019ve engaged in a lot of predatory domination of the market and it'd be shocking if the judge washed the case out.\"for paul rickard, editor of the boycott microsoft campaign, nothing would be more satisfying than news of findings against microsoft.\"they have played with the law for too long and they think they can get away with it,\" he said. \"it sounds like it's going to be bad for microsoft and that's a good thing.\"but mitch stone, a consumer activist and the editor-in-chief of a different boycott microsoft web page, takes a more cynical spin. he said a decision in either direction wouldn't mean much for the future of high technology, much less monopolistic business practices.\"it's too little, too late to really help,\" stone said. \"this is a browser war, which is history. unless the courts can push the parties toward a settlement, and then it can result in some immediate structural change to microsoft's business, it'll be fought out in court for a few more years, and by that time what difference will it make?\"but the cynicism that surrounds the case won't stop provenzo's free-market cause. \"to support microsoft would be an act of heroic independence,\" he said. \"it's a lonely crusade but someone's got to do it.\""}
