[a health-consultation site] is definitely not anything i would trust someone to throw together in a day. we've taken 15 months.\"among the ama guidelines is a stipulation that doctors actually see patients face to face. while a telemedicine web site can't do that, chalkley said health-care sites can provide many services remotely.dispensing medical advice over the internet isn't so different from giving it over the phone, something doctors do all the time on weekends and during off-hours, chalkley said. \"it happens every time you call a doctor at night in the er, saying 'my son has a fever and is vomiting.'\"better still, telemedicine group physicians will have a full medical history of each patient before diagnosing or prescribing."}
