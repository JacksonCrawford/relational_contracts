report claiming that nearly two-thirds of net users don't trust e-commerce. by joanna glasner.", "author": "joanna glasner", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "08.18.1999 09:30 AM", "text": "although a large majority of net users harbor fears about privacy and security on e-commerce sites, it hasn't kept them from pulling out their credit cards. but it has slowed down spending, and merchants are taking notice. two-thirds of online shoppers responding to a recent survey said they worry about the security of sites they visit. the figures, published tuesday by jupiter communications, concludes that the steps taken by merchants so far -- like posting of privacy policies on their web sites -- have done little to assuage shoppers' anxieties.the findings aren't causing any dramatic revisions in projections for growth of electronic commerce transactions yet. e-commerce has grown exponentially over the past three years, and that growth is expected to continue into the foreseeable future.but privacy advocates, merchants, and government regulators say that sales would increase even faster if web sites found a way to assure customers that the data they submit is actually secure.\"sure, you see exponential growth compared to the fact that three years ago there was nothing,\" said mozelle w. thompson, commissioner at the federal trade commission. \"but if you look at the surveys of those who browse the web and those who actually buy, only 5 percent actually buy. that's a fairly small number.\"the jupiter survey said more than a third of net users say they distrust security protections at internet sites across the board, regardless of posted consumer protection policies. only 36 percent said they were reassured by corporate privacy policies outlining procedures for handling personal data.and while no figures exist to show how much revenue is lost because people are scared off, merchants believe that it's a lot.\"i think it's clear that if we could allay consumer concerns over things such as privacy there'd be a much higher purchase rate on the internet,\" said david steer, spokesman for truste, an industry group that licenses \"seals of approval\" to web sites that follow a prescribed set of privacy practices.although the consortium has concentrated mainly on standardizing privacy practices at web sites, it plans to begin focusing more on educating net users about how to make sure data isn't wrongly collected and distributed online.truste isn't alone. scores of net merchants and privacy activists are pushing to create clearly written privacy policies, while putting options on their sites that allow users to withhold certain data. at the same time, however, merchants are seeing a shift in customers' top concerns.in the past, transmission of credit card information over the web was a major source of worry. now, people are more concerned about sites that store and collect personal data.priceline.com, best known for its airline ticket auctions, is a case in point. when the site launched, priceline executives were careful to include an option to call in credit card information over the telephone.but contrary to the company's initial expectations, the service never really took off. from the start, only about 5 percent of users opted to use the phone, with the number dropping steadily in subsequent months.the concern that web sites are tackling now is often about registration forms users must fill out to get access to content or to complete a transaction.\"i'm nervous of where my information is going. that's more of a concern to me than where i use my credit card,\" said steven klebe, vice president of payment industry alliances at cybersource, a company that provides security applications for e-commerce sites. \"the thing that drives me crazy more than anything else is having to register at sites.\"tara lemmey, executive director of the electronic frontier foundation, says the privacy and security policies are in the early stages of an evolution that will likely take years to carry through, not unlike other emerging industries.back when the first cars came out, lemmey noted, people's biggest fear was of being hit by one. it took years for such enforcement and security measures as insurance, stoplights, and highway cops to catch up with the technology.with internet commerce, people are more afraid of damage to their identity -- with data about everything from pants size to credit history swapped back and forth from vast electronic databases. privacy concerns will probably rise with the development of such new data-tracking technologies as biometrics, which stores information on fingerprints and other physical features.\"when, with a thumbprint, you can buy a burrito and levi's is scanning your body, you've got some issues,\" lemmey said."}
