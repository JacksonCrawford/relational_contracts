not so good. electronics giant nec (nipny) said it will see an almost $1.3 billion group net loss for the current fiscal year, and will slash its workforce by 15,000. in keeping with custom, the company's president, hisashi kaneko, will resign to take responsibility for nec's performance, but will still receive a paycheck as an \"adviser.\" nec slipped 13 cents to $44.in telecom, corecomm (commf) climbed 27 percent to $33.25 as it agreed to buy the bulk of usn communications' assets for as much as $85 million in ready cash. usn is now cleaning house after filing for bankruptcy protection from creditors. meanwhile, satellite communications provider comsat (cq) advanced $1.50 to $29 after salomon smith barney raised its rating for the company's stock to \"buy\" from \"outperform.\"a gloomy day for daimlerchrysler (dcx). the automaker fell $2.56 to $93.94 after being told by a philadelphia court to pay $58.5 million in damages in a case where a woman said she was burned by gases from a deploying airbag. daimler will try to have the decision overturned or will file an appeal. (\"ten years ago, we would have received as thank-you note from a customer for the airbag having saved her life,\" a company lawyer was quoted as saying. \"today, we get slapped with a multimillion-dollar verdict.\")polaroid -- boy, we haven't heard from these guys in a while -- vaulted 15 percent to $21.88 following a highly speculative report in business week that the company may be seeking a merger partner. polaroid (prd) could be worth as much as $40 a share, the magazine said.lastly, pfizer (pfe) had the near-term rating for its stock downgraded by merrill lynch to \"accumulate\" from \"buy.\" the viagra maker sagged $2.81 to $128.31.sorry. couldn't resist."}
