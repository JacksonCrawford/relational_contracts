television, most likely. by ronald warren deutsch.", "author": "ronald warren deutsch", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "01.26.1999 02:05 PM", "text": "while the rest of the world waits for the mysteries of digital television to unfold, the corporation for public broadcasting and the public broadcasting service have not been idle. they've been investing in a variety of projects, some of which debut this week. \"our aim is to get more producers and technical people together experimenting and creating enlightened and provocative programming,\" says robert t. coonrod, president and ceo for the cpb.according to the consumer electronic manufacturer's association, over 13,000 dtvs have been sold to consumers in the two months they've appeared on the market. \"our surveys are showing that people are excited about the interactive possibilities, but nobody really knows what exactly that's going to be,\" said cynthia upson, a cema spokeswoman. that's the same tune we heard last fall when dtv made its official debut.the cpb wants to know what people want out of digital tv, so it's hosting focus groups with producers and consumers around the country. these projects are the first from the digital incubator, the broadcaster's name for the group studying the public interest in dtv and making recommendations on developing digital programming.six new projects in the works range from a documentary on southern literature to a 3-d animated series for children. cpb's partners for these various projects include mit's media lab, new-media design firms razorfish and ixl, universal family & home entertainment, wgbh in boston, and the columbia school of journalism.in addition to developing new shows, public broadcasters are looking at fresh ways to present old standards.\"take a show like great performances, and enhance it,\" said coonrod. one day he envisions a viewer being able to watch the performance from various perspectives, follow the written score, even mute a particular instrument and play along. \"we will take significant cultural content and expand the impact into new dimensions.\"coonrod believes there may not be a single format -- such as an enhanced computer or computer-enhanced tv -- for delivery. he uses the term \"platform agnostic,\" believing you may get one format of programming in your home, one in your car, and another in the office.the end result would sound or look the same, but the way it's transmitted would be different. \"we want the producers and consumers to develop the standards rather than have the technology dictate and work its way down,\" he said. the public broadcasting service also has taken a pro-dtv role.\"we have made a commitment to broadcast at least one hdtv show a month\" since november, said dara goldberg, associate director of corporate communications for pbs. the next will be a tribute to muddy waters, king of the blues airing 27 january. hdtv, or high-definition digital television, offers a superior quality picture but not necessarily enhanced programming.last november, in cooperation with intel, pbs aired a special enhanced version of ken burns' documentary on architect frank lloyd wright. according to adam grossberg of intel, a group of intel employees were given dtv receiver cards for their computers, which downloaded over 200 megabytes of data as the program aired. the data included 3-d images of wright's buildings, which users could tour, and additional interviews with wright.\"our interest is to make sure the hardware and the programming develop concurrently,\" said grossberg. recently, intel and neilsen media research said they will be working together to develop technology for measuring consumer usage of enhanced dtv.pbs and intel are also working together on <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"externallink\",\"outgoingurl\":\"http://www.pbs.org/whatson/press/zoboomafoo.html\"}' href=\"http://www.pbs.org/whatson/press/zoboomafoo.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">zoboomafoo</a>, a wildlife program for children which debuted monday.\"kids will be able to play games and join in with activities at the same time the program airs,\" said grossberg.the enhanced digital programming won't be available, however, until midyear, and even then very few people will have the technology to receive the signals. nevertheless, goldberg believes it is pbs' commitment to the technology at this point that matters. \"the more we offer consumers, the more they'll want it,\" she said.in keeping with that belief, in september, pbs will launch its new, interactive, 24-hour pbs kids channel. all shows on the channel will eventually be broadcast with enhanced dtv programming, including zoboomafoo.coonrod perhaps best explained why public broadcasting is running with digital-tv formats. \"the technology has finally caught up with our mission.\""}
