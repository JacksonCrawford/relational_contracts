get attention? great product? superior customer service? nah, it's high-priced pr. by craig bicknell.", "author": "craig bicknell", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "11.11.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "a couple of months back, ed niehaus was in his office when a call came from a legendary silicon valley venture capitalist. \"we want you to do the publicity for [company x],\" said the vc, referring to a net infrastructure company that niehaus' pr firm, niehaus ryan wong, had already scoped out and turned down.the account would only be worth us$20,000 a month. niehaus was looking for something more in the $40-$45k range, and he said so.\"that's fine,\" said the vc, who shall remain nameless at niehaus' request. \"i'm on the board, and they pretty much do what i say. i'll tell them to spend $40,000.\"whoa, thought niehaus.\"this is a guy -- these are people -- that we used to be schmoozing for business,\" he said. \"now this vc is saying, money is not the scarce resource here -- you are.\"welcome to spin city in silicon valley, the geographic ribbon from san jose to san francisco, where there are so many newly minted, well-funded dot coms raising a cacophony of competitive shouts that they'll pay nearly any price to rise above the noise.in an era when so many dot coms are going public with no profits, little revenue, and a big idea, the story of what's to come becomes all important, and the storytellers become kingmakers.but, even while they feast on the fat of the market, the pr pros are noting the flitting canaries that foretell a big bust, at least for the consumer-oriented dot coms. scads of well-funded new dot coms not only have no profits or revenue -- they have no story.\"this is a time of unprecedented feeding frenzy for the pr firms,\" said niehaus, whose company turns away as many as 200 potential clients for every one it takes on.it's the same story up and down the peninsula.\"we get 12-15 new business calls a day,\" said susan buttenhoff, president and ceo of access communications. \"a year ago it was 12-15 a week. two years ago, 12-15 every two months.\"like nrw, access turns away far more clients than it takes.not that clients ultimately go wanting: there are new pr firms popping up like morning mushrooms all over the valley. no one can hire fast enough. there are five jobs awaiting every seasoned pr pro. and salaries are going through the ceiling. freelance spin-meisters are billing $125 an hour and taking stock options to boot.\"they don't take the time planning how to differentiate,\" said buttenhoff of the new companies. \"there's a great belief in 'first to market owns the market.' they feel like the gun has gone off and they're two links behind.\"end result: a dozen or more dot coms with a fistful of cash pop up in the pets market, or the drugs market, or the furniture market, and all they have to say is: \"we're going to sell this stuff online, same as the other 11.\"\"no one's looking at unique selling propositions,\" buttenhoff said. \"used to be, you wouldn't spend a dollar on marketing without a unique selling proposition. these [dot coms] all start to sound the same, to be frank.\"\"there's a naivete in many cases,\" adds harry pforzheimer, executive vp and general manager of the silicon valley office of edelman pr. \"you get these guys coming in and saying, 'we've got an ipo in three months and we want to be on the cover of business week.' they don't realize that the companies that are going to be successful have some story to tell, they're not just rushing to make a buzz because they're going to market.\"for every company with a clue, niehaus says, 10 or 20 come knocking. \"we get so many calls from people who are number eight in a field of 15, and they have no clarity at all.\"those with a clue, however, have a story that spins way, way out into the future, said dennis maxwell, senior vp at the silicon valley office of cunningham communications. for these companies, the pr people become something akin to business strategists, anticipating evolutions in the market 3-4 years out, laying out the plot lines.but, industry execs say, there aren't many companies that either (a) think they need to plan that far out, or (b) have the smarts for it.the upshot, pr pros say: expect a shakeout in coming months, with consumer-oriented dot coms faltering on the market, giving way to the less sexy -- but perhaps more lucrative -- business-to-business companies.\"there's gonna be a bloodbath,\" said buttenhoff. as a result, she expects the tech pr industry to shrink as much as a third in the next three years.but that's the future, and now is now, and the getting's good.\"i don't want to say we've hit the peak, because it's so much fun,\" said clif mayne, an account executive for usa marketing, which, among other things, helps design the \"tchotchkes\" that companies pass out at trade shows and promotional events.\"these companies are so young. it's almost like they're pro athletes -- they're really young and all of a sudden they have so much money to throw around.\""}
