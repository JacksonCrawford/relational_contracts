'adumbrate' is a reference to the number-crunching power of the crusoe processor, but where does nbc fit in?\"well, let's see. nbc is owned by general electric, which is a major competitor of sega, who make the dreamcast. jack welch, the ceo of ge, is a known associate of warren buffet, who is thought to be a big fan of the cinnabon [tm] breakfast roll.\"it seems to me that the logo must be part of a secret code between welch, buffet and stallman (probably all members of the illuminati), to put the wind up sega, and remind them not to stop putting satanic symbols in the sonic games.\"in truth, the product name crusoe was chosen because it implies adventure and survival, pescaro said.robinson crusoe \"survived against awesome odds,\" pescaro said. \"he was very resourceful and because of these connotations, it was a good name to build the brand around.\"over the years, the rumors surrounding transmeta have tended to say more about hot topics in the tech industry than they did about the company.in the early days, when java was hot, transmeta was working on a java chip.then, when pcs went multimedia, transmeta was purported to be working on a superfast media processor.then it was an intel-killing, re-programmable, super-fast, super-cheap superchip that ran any operating system on the planet.a couple of years ago, the company hired torvalds, chief architect of the linux operating system and patron saint of geeks everywhere, and the rumor mill really kicked into high gear.transmeta was said to be collaborating with russian superchip designers who built missile defense systems during the cold war; transmeta has blacked out windows even though it's headquartered in sunny santa clara, california. transmeta's chip designs are ripped off from a downed ufo.and the rumors went on:transmeta chips would drive a comeback of the beloved amiga. transmeta was working on chips for laptops, followed by chips for linux/internet appliances and, lastly, mobile and wireless devices.at comdex on wednesday, torvalds offered the first loose details of the project, saying that company had developed a \"smart\" microprocessor.but that's about as far as anyone from the company will go when talking about transmeta's january launch. \"there will be a few surprises in it,\" pescaro said. \"it will be worth everyone's wait. i think it will not only fulfill expectations, it will exceed them.\"as salon's andrew leonard has pointed out, transmeta is right out of novelist thomas pynchon: a startup obsessed with secrecy hires the most famous programmer in the world. rumored to be the great white hope for breaking up the intel/microsoft duopoly, it's funded by microsoft co-founder paul allen.\"only a pynchon would have dared such silliness,\" leonard wrote."}
