- - - -platon said that early estimates of victims run in the thousands to tens of thousands of individual machines. he said it would be a few days before an accurate assessment would be available.antivirus company mcafee has posted a patch to its web site that will detect the worm, and contains instructions on how to remove it.in an effort to halt the spread of the worm, intel shut down email exchanges between offices in europe and the middle east. a microsoft employee also said that the company had shut off incoming, outgoing, and internal email at the company's redmond, washington headquarters.the worm is unusually clever in its design. the hostile code replies to email with a message containing the same subject line and an attached file that appears to be a .zip archive.\"i received your email and i shall send you a reply asap,\" reads the trick email. \"till then, take a look at the attached zipped docs.\"users who click on the apparent archive to open it receive an authentic-looking error message. meanwhile, the worm immediately searches the victim's hard drive for microsoft word, excel, and powerpoint files, and erases their contents.an internal virus alert mailed to intel employees hints at the seriousness of the problem.\"the virus originated in israel,\" reads an internal virus alert circulated among intel employees.\"at this time, israel is unable to send and receive email. in addition, to isolate this virus, the greater europe region [ger] \u2013 ireland, emea, and israel \u2013 cannot send or receive messages from non-intel sites within ger, nor can employees in the region send or receive messages from intel and non-intel sites in the americas and the greater asia region.\"intel spokesperson adam grossberg said the company's it department became aware of the worm in the region and immediately began countermeasures. he said it would be premature to estimate its effects.eric chien, senior researcher at the symantec antivirus research center, said there's a key difference between melissa and winexplore: one is dangerous because it spreads fast, the other because of the damage it does once it arrives.\"melissa had a huge fan-out. it caused a pure load of messages sent out to hundreds of thousands of emails to servers all over the world,\" chien said. \"that forced those servers to basically crawl to a halt and be shut down.\"\"in contrast, we don't expect winexplore to shut down servers due to pure load. but what makes it so malicious is that it contains a payload. it looks for [and destroys] microsoft office documents, excel spreadsheets, and powerpoint presentations.\"chien said that worm and virus authors are taking advantage of an increasingly connected computer world \u2013 and the ubiquitous microsoft software within it.\"we're definitely at a critical junction in the antivirus world. microsoft office and word and excel's macroviruses [which infected documents from those programs specifically] were a huge threat, especially to corporate enterprise \u2013 which uses office almost exclusively.\"worm writers take advantage of computers that are connected to the net 24 hours a day. \"virus writers are using this to spread their worms and trojan [horses] even faster than before,\" he said.microsoft could not be reached for comment.one victim of the worm said she knew something was afoot when staffers in her office began receiving the same email from everyone in the department.\"we turned off our computers and alerted the help desk, but not soon enough \u2013 all our files were deleted,\" said the victim, who works for a large telecommunications firm and spoke on condition of anonymity.\"i am pretty stoic about it,\" she said. \"i put it into perspective \u2013 it is a lot better to have something like this to happen and lose work than for someone to infiltrate our system.\"\"i hope these talented people will use their genius for good and not evil,\" said the source.related wired links:time-bomb virus explodes on pcs26.apr.99melissa was but a sniffle22.apr.99'melissa' police work lauded2.apr.99.melissa, spawned by spam30.mar.99fbi warns of melissa virus29.mar.99don't mess with 'melissa'29.mar.99"}
