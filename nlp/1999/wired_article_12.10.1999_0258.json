(shamir is the 's' in rsa.)\"israeli cryptography today is a direct result of shamir and his students,\" said fiat. the academic climate created by shamir spawned not only fiat but also technion's eli biham, inventor of a now-prevalent method for assessing the impenetrability of encryption algorithms.but cryptography in israel is not restricted to academia.fiat is one of the founders of algorithmic research, a company specializing in data security products and smartcards.\"we have cryptographers and mathematicians on our staff,\" says gil cordova, algorithmic research's vp of marketing. except for in extremely rare cases, the company is not called upon to invent new encryption algorithms. primarily, algorithmic research analyzes a client's cryptographic requirements and employs standard algorithms to best suit these needs.in cryptography, it's not which algorithm you use, says cordova, it's the way that you use it. \"we recommend that our customers, especially commercial customers, use the standard algorithms because they have been extensively tried and tested. most of the popular encryption algorithms have been around for a while, because no one has been able to break them.\"these standard encryption algorithms form the basis for most of the technology developed by israel's large number of security-related startups. the best known of these is checkpoint, the inventor of the now-ubiquitous firewall. among others, there is finjan, whose software defends against attacks from java or activex applets, and newer players such as alchemedia, which offers protection against theft of images from the internet.while much of israeli high-tech has military roots, with cryptography, says fiat, \"it is almost the other way around. as a rule, if you are doing anything to do with cryptography in the army, you can't do it in the civilian world.\"\"this rule has apparently been relaxed a little in the last few years, but many people who are doing fantastic things in cryptography in the military are completely unknown on the outside.\"however, avi rembaum, marketing and communications manager of radguard, believes there is a greater connection to the military than fiat thinks. radguard, a member of the rad group of israeli data communications startups, focuses on virtual private networks. \"using technologies developed in the army is not allowed, but those who served in the israeli army equivalent of the national security agency, the 8200 unit, are very sought after,\" said rembaum.together, the cryptographic skills honed by the military and in academia have produced an active encryption-based tech industry. \"israel is without doubt a leader in encryption,\" says rembaum. \"if you walk around any security show in the world, you hear hebrew everywhere.\"the israeli government is one of this sector's best local customers. \"all the ministries use our technology,\" said rembaum. \"we are very lucky that we have a paranoid government.\""}
