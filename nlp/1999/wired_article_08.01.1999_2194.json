f/x guru kevin mack. __ here inside kevin mack's brain, i see a tangle of kelpy neurons and dendrites swaying in a clear fluid flecked with floating particles. up ahead, there's a lightning storm of activity propagating down axons. like a passenger in the microsubmarine from fantastic voyage, i'm tailing the signals as they crackle across the cortex and proceed through the skull, exiting via a pore on the forehead.i'm not inside the brain between mack's ears, of course. i'm in an editing room, looking at the brain he created on a computer for the opening scene of fight club, the dark summer movie directed by david fincher and starring brad pitt and edward norton. opening this month, fight club is about a group of ennui-soaked yuppies who get their kicks by beating each other up. the 95-second intracranial odyssey takes you from the fear center of norton's brain, through his skull, and out to a perspective where you see what he's so worked up about: he has a gun in his mouth, and he's thinking about pulling the trigger. the shot is the longest computer-generated scene ever produced by digital domain, the cutting-edge f/x shop where mack works as visual-effects supervisor.\"it starts out in the amygdala and follows the thought from its origin,\" says mack, who looks like a goateed jeff bridges. \"once we pass out of gray matter we sort of weave through a sulcus and see all the big arteries, and then we pass through the meninges, all the layers of the subarachnoid space, these chambers that distribute cerebrospinal fluid through the brain.\" he speaks in a dreamy, somewhat nasal voice, but there's a warbly undertone, as if he's suppressing the urge to rant.when fincher asked digital domain for the brain fly-through, he already knew that mack had transformed marina del rey into beijing for red corner and had created the hypnagogic afterworld in what dreams may come. fincher, and other directors like luc besson of the fifth element fame, request mack because the 40-year-old artist and animator, matte painter and model maker, and photographer and compositor is a master at seamlessly weaving various components into live-action worlds. they know that mack (who earned his first academy award this year as part of the f/x team for what dreams may come) is a leader among a new coterie of hollywood wizards: the guys who create \"invisible effects\" - computer-enhanced scenes that fool the audience into believing the shots were produced with live actors on location, but are really composed of a m\u00e9lange of digital and live-action footage.but what fincher did not know was that mack had already devoured almost every major book on computational neuroscience and complex adaptive systems, and was aching for a chance to shoehorn his extracurricular obsession into a movie.__ mack's dream transcends f/x: to create a universe of thinking creatures within his computer. __and it's doubtful any director knows mack's foremost dream: to create an artificial world that lives beyond the movie screen, a universe populated with thinking creatures that will live and die within a computer and even communicate with him. that's the lobe in mack's brain that isn't reflected in the adrenaline-pumping scenes of terror he's known for - like the airplane disaster in fight club. in this shot, a learjet collides in midair with an airliner; its flight attendant is liquefied on impact, transformed into a red smear against the cabin wall.\"we've redone the whole splatter,\" mack tells me while the scene plays out before us. \"it's much worse now. it's like somebody took a shotgun to a hefty bag full of ketchup.\" as the jet peels open like a can of sardines, the passengers are sucked from their seats one by one and sent hurtling through the air. one particularly disturbed victim clutches the armrests of his chair.\"that's me!\" mack says gleefully.mack's office in venice, california, is shaped like an upended shoebox; the only natural light comes from a skylight 40 feet overhead. in lieu of windows, the walls are plastered with a seemingly random mix of toys, pictures, and papers. but the artifacts are imbued with meaning for mack, and signify the influences and obsessions that have led him to where he is today. the polaroid of mack posing with an actor in a monster costume, for example, represents his fascination with cryptozoology.mack still vividly remembers the day he took an interest in monsters. he was 5 years old, visiting his aunt in westwood. he says he was taking an afternoon nap when a \"very tall, dark thing\" entered his room. \"it looked like a black, scaly, feathered bird, with a strange, black, shiny beak,\" says mack. \"its eyes were wet, with real veins, and as big as baseballs. i knew it wasn't a mask.\" (mack is completely serious about such recollections. after telling me a couple of other far-out stories, he laughs nervously and asks, \"are they going to lock me up, or shoot me for spilling the beans?\")maybe the monster-vision thing is genetic. kevin wasn't the first member of the mack family to conceive of strange beasts: in 1940 his dad brice mack painted the cavernous gut of monstro the whale for pinocchio. both of mack's parents worked for disney's animation studio, and they stoked kevin's imagination further, inspiring him to copy the work of his favorite artists, especially that of sword-and-sorcery virtuoso frank frazetta. after graduating from high school, mack gained admission to the prestigious art center college of design in pasadena, didn't quite graduate, hit the pavement, and got a job with an aquarium-cleaning service. a rubber octopus thumbtacked to the wall of his office marks the countless hours he spent scraping algae for the likes of liberace and michael landon.by 1983, mack had neither a college degree nor a plan to become something more than fishbowl-scrubber-to-the-stars. but he did have a wife, martha snow mack, a fellow art student who was about to give birth to their first child. in a panic, mack's father yanked some strings and got his son a job at coast special effects in north hollywood, home of the pillsbury doughboy. there, mack made miniatures and animated clay figures for tv commercials and feature films. he also demonstrated the first glimmers of a talent for visual-effects artistry that would later land him matte-painting gigs on apollo 13, interview with the vampire, true lies, and the fifth element.after a few years, mack went freelance, winding up at dino delaurentiis' movie studio in north carolina working on the flop 1986 sequel to king kong. two years after he arrived, the studio shut down and a nearly broke mack family moved back to la, where he scored a freelance job on the abyss. director james cameron liked what he saw and talked the kid up; from then on, good work poured in.in his digital domain office, a half dozen posters of blue-skinned hindu deities in his office hint at one of the more esoteric jobs in mack's r\u00e9sum\u00e9. over the years, he had studied hinduism, and in 1991 he met swami chidvilasananda (known by followers as gurumayi), the head of the siddha yoga ashram, in south fallsburg, new york.at gurumayi's invitation, the mack family visited the ashram, and the hollywood effects whiz was asked to design the shiva lingam, the sacred phallic symbol of the hindu god shiva. \"they flew some head brahmin priests over from india who said i was the maha-sculptor of our age,\" mack says. he made a small clay model and presented it to gurumayi at a ceremony before 5,000 people. the shiva lingam was shipped to india, where it was cast in silver and ensconced in a temple. it's still there, bathed periodically in milk and ghee.__ \"who would dream of trying to construct a brain?\" says mack. \"but we could grow something similar.\" __as mack and his family prepared to leave paradise, gurumayi asked them to stay, and even paid the bills mounting back home. \"but it was clear we didn't belong there,\" mack says. the siddha yoga ashram \"draws a crowd of seekers whose goal is to be utterly serene.\" kevin and martha wanted to be noisy. he missed going to drag races. they were itching to play in their psychedelia band the fringe. so they returned to la, and when james cameron, stan winston, and scott ross were launching digital domain, scott called mack and convinced him to join the team.in his tenure at digital domain, mack has worked as a computer artist, digital-effects art director, and visual-effects supervisor on more than a dozen movies. besides producing mind-bending scenes that have viewers wondering how they were pulled off, mack is increasingly asked to create effects that are special because nobody watching them would guess that they were \"filmed\" mostly inside a computer.jon avnet, director of red corner, the 1997 thriller starring richard gere, says that given the ubiquity of bluescreen shooting, movies are approaching \"the beginning of a whole new day\" when most everything is shot on bluescreen. \"kevin will be at the forefront when that happens,\" he says.avnet credits mack with an \"amazing ability\" to fabricate realism from a patchwork of cg and live action. because the chinese government forbade avnet to film on location in beijing, the director relied on mack to blend actors filmed in los angeles with still photos and steadicam footage of chinese locations, shot on the sly by the director and a crew of guerrilla cinematographers. avnet took three nighttime photographs of the american embassy with his 35-mm camera. stateside, he handed the blurry exposures to mack, who, he says, \"degrained them and made them into a background.\" the result, says avnet, was \"a miracle to me.\"mack is known for working with an obsession bordering on the pathological. \"a lot of artists are content with a limited understanding of the tools they use,\" says caleb howard, who worked with mack at digital domain and is now an r&d supervisor at los angeles special-effects house rhythm & hues. \"kevin is never content. he's an artist who aspires to know his medium.\"back in his office, the 12-foot-long printout of computer code hanging from his wall is testament to mack's whole-hog disposition. here's a snippet:*- /f[\"!///bt//j]\"+!f[\"\"+/~$ **- !e]t//j]!/+/f+/\"f-/!f+/f[!\"//f/^fxt//j]- **- e]t//j]!/+/f+/\"f-/!f+/f[!\"//f/^fxt//j]- *these strings of characters are the dna of a digital seed that grew into the blossoming tree in what dreams may come. the tree, as well as the brain in fight club, were built using an l-system, named for botanist aristid lindenmayer, who in 1968 developed a mathematical system to classify plants according to their branching structure.but l-systems can also be used to synthesize images of lifelike structures. you can write a program that uses an l-system as a set of rules to specify the length and angles of the branches and sub-branches of tumbleweeds, capillaries, bronchial systems, and neural anatomy. l-systems could, mack believes, enable a-life researchers to \"grow\" pseudo life-forms with strikingly organic anatomy.mack, an admitted \"artificial-life zealot,\" says he \"got into neuroscience to look for ways we could create lifelike intelligence,\" a fantasy project that's consumed his evenings for years. he already knows enough about the brain that last year he was asked to speak at the dedication of the brain mapping center at ucla. \"he's extremely well read,\" says john mazziotta, the center's director. \"his theories are unconventional, but that's what makes them interesting.\"speaking to hundreds of neurology pros, mack introduced himself as an \"amateur neuroscientist\" and spouted \"a few ideas on evolving complex neural topology,\" including his plans for growing software-based \"mice men\" and \"creating a form of artificial intelligence based on biologically inspired neural networks.\"before the brain, it was the musculoskeletal structure that consumed mack's attention. a few years ago, mack and then-coworker caleb howard got the green light from digital domain to launch a skunk-works project called hard, short for human animation research and development. they buried themselves in anatomy, kinesiology, and artificial-life research papers and then turned that knowledge into a piece of software that could produce realistic human bodies.__ mack undertakes assignments with a degree of obsession bordering on the pathological. __now, building on the hard system, mack and his array of high-speed workstations have taken on a nearly impossible project - evolving realistic-looking life-forms that exist only in a computer. ones as smart as, or smarter than, him.\"people say, 'oh, you'll never be able to construct a human brain,'\" he says. \"well, duh! who would dream of such a thing? with billions of neurons all hooked up the way they are? i don't think so. but we could grow something similar,\" in much the same way that his fight club brain was grown from a digital seed.the idea of creating computer-based worlds populated with creatures that can breed, evolve, and compete for limited resources has been around for some time. (see \"do-it-yourself darwin,\" wired 6.10, page 164.) a common type of artificial life is the genetic algorithm. an example: you start out with 1,000 randomly written \"programs,\" really nothing more than haphazard strings of 0s and 1s. then you see how well each can perform a specified task, such as arranging a list of words in alphabetical order. of course, the programs won't work at all, but one of them will fail less spectacularly than the rest. you save that one, and make 1,000 mutant variants, randomly changing a couple of bits here and there in the mother program. then you test the second generation. if you continue to repeat the process thousands or hundreds of thousands of times, you'll end up with a very efficient list-sorting program.what mack and two colleagues want to do is create programs that can reproduce and mutate - and, in addition, make them look like realistic creatures. they're developing a suite of programs to make artful a-life, and searching for a well-heeled benefactor to fund their plans for a research lab and think tank. mack's erstwhile hard partner, caleb howard, has been cranking out code for the project. the third member of the a-life effort is gregory simpson, a neuroscientist at the albert einstein college of medicine in new york city. simpson - who met mack at the ucla brain mapping center inauguration - specializes in computer modeling of brain function and imaging of brain activity, and has worked with the dalai lama, studying the effects of meditation on attention and consciousness.so far, mack and howard have developed a program, called morphogenesis, that picks up where hard leaves off - giving them the ability to cross-breed the bodies that hard churns out. using another program still in development, the team will define the details of the virtual environments (such as wind and gravity) and of the critters themselves (such as herd behavior and locomotion). the next step will be, well, harder: giving the little beasts they create some intelligence. mack believes the right mix of neural networks, genetic algorithms, and a sufficiently stimulating artificial environment will do the trick. \"kevin's taught himself enough to do it in a way that's quite plausible, and would work,\" says mazziotta.which is, of course, mack's style. don't pause to wonder whether you'll pull it off - just dive in."}
