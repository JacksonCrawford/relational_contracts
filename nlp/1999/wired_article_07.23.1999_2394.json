pesky shrinkwrap software licenses. almost everybody thinks it's a bad idea. by oscar s. cisneros.", "author": "oscar s. cisneros", "category": "security", "type": "article", "timestamp": "07.23.1999

to software vendors like microsoft. \"the [proposed law] changes existing law in several ways, almost all to the benefit of software vendors and against the best interest of consumers,\" said mark lemley, an intellectual property professor at the university of texas school of law.members of the national conference of commissioners on state laws, a group of legal experts which recommends model laws to state legislatures, will discuss the uniform computer information transactions act, or ucita, this weekend at its annual meeting in denver.the proposal is a sweeping attempt to bring uniformity to electronic commerce transactions, everything from digital signatures to click-through licensing agreements to shrink-wrap contracts. the courts have yet to arrive at a consensus on how to deal with these issues, so the nccusl has been trying to draft a blueprint for computer and information transactions.critics say it will lead to confusion, erode users' rights, and tip the scale of power to already dominant software vendors. if passed at the conference, commissioners will take the proposed law to their constituent states for passage by local legislatures. at the beginning of the conference, five pounds worth of letters opposing the ucita was submitted to the commissioners.\"we don't have a uniform contract code for information and licenses,\" said holly towle, a proponent of ucita who has at times represented the business software alliance.more than 300 pages long, ucita proposes sweeping reform to some facets of e-commerce. while areas such as digital signatures could be affected, ucita's biggest impact will be on shrink-wrap licenses -- the contracts software companies insist go into effect when the shrink-wrap seal is broken.users often toss the shrink-wrap and its legalese into the trash because most of them think the terms don't apply, said pamela samuelson, professor of law and information management at the berkeley center for law and technology.\"what ucita will do more than anything is validate those licenses and all their terms,\" said samuelson, who last year oversaw a conference on the topic. \"it's time to start paying attention.\"the fundamental injustice of shrink-wrap agreements is that the consumer doesn't get to know the key terms of the contract until they open the box -- by which point its often too late to get the money back. in traditional contract law, the parties have to come of a \"meeting of the minds\" over key terms of the agreement.\"software licenses change that assumption by saying that when you take the software home, and you take it out of the box, you agree to a whole host of other terms that you didn't agree to at the store,\" said ut's lemley.the courts are split on the validity of shrink-wrap and on-screen click-through licenses, he said. by codifying the validity of these licenses, software vendors could gain an unfair advantage.\"under current law, you can't sneak in an unreasonable and surprising term and hope that it slips by,\" lemley said. \"ucita would permit precisely such a term.\"if software vendors get to dictate the terms of these licenses with the weight of the courts behind them, many bad consequences will follow, he said. a software publisher could absolve itself of all responsibility by simply writing such language into the license. the user would have no choice but to agree.\"this draft will effectively insulate software makers from not only breakdowns of their systems but active damage from their systems,\" he said. if microsoft absolves itself through legalese, it would have no incentive to make bug-free products, he said.the us federal trade commission, a major consumer watchdog, is also concerned because ucita wouldn't require the vendors to spell out the terms of the agreements before the deal is struck.consider what happened recently with yahoo. through its terms of service agreement, it tried to assert ownership of thousands of web sites hosted on its geocities unit. when its customers found out about the changes and howled, other web hosting companies rushed to offer less restrictive terms and lure them away from yahoo. facing a massive user flight, yahoo backed down.in contrast, ucita wouldn't require the upfront disclosure of terms, so the act wouldn't promote competition on the least restrictive terms.although the language of ucita lets users get a complete refund if dissatisfied with the shrink-wrap terms, the recent experience of linux users suggests something else.\"there was an effort to try to return windows 95 and 98 -- nobody would accept it,\" samuelson said. with no upfront terms and no mechanism for a return, consumers are more likely to keep software no matter how restrictive the terms.but towle countered samuelson's claims, saying that ucita provides more protection than existing law.\"it says by statute that the retailer has to give you a refund and there's nothing in existing law that says that.\""}
