massive sell-off. the dow's streak of record closes comes to a crashing halt. by david lazarus.", "author": "david lazarus", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "04.19.1999 02:00 PM", "text": "tech stocks took a major shellacking monday, with the  nasdaq composite index plunging 138.19 points, or 5.6 percent, to close at 2345.85. it was the nasdaq's second-biggest point drop ever.the carnage stemmed from compaq computer telling ceo eckhard pfeiffer to pack his bags and hit the road, and the company's chief financial officer calling it quits as well. meanwhile, internet stocks got reamed after an influential industry analyst warned of trouble ahead.the dow jones industrial average shed 53.56 points to 10440.53 -- quite a retreat from its record intra-day high of 10765.74. after coming within striking distance of 11000 for the first time ever, the blue-chip index logged its first finish in the minus column after five straight all-time highs.the s&p 500 was 29.48 lower at 1289.52.the market's red-asphalt performance in the late afternoon stood in stark contrast to an unusually strong morning. the dow had surged more than 250 points after citigroup (c) posted better-than-expected quarterly profit of us$1.04 a share. but the huge sell-off in tech stocks soon dragged the blue chips back to earth, and proceeded to bury them altogether.\"when you're riding the train, it keeps going before it hits a truck at the crossing,\" said allan roness, research director at jw genesis securities. the dow slammed into that truck head-on.of course, it was inevitable that the dow would finally succumb to the same jitters about growth and earnings that have been plaguing other indices. in the past week we've seen a big shift in cash, away from the market's erstwhile darlings, tech and internet shares, and into \"cyclical\" stocks like heavy industry and energy. the 30 stocks comprising the dow have benefitted most from this transformation because, for many investors, especially the recent arrivals, they represent old-fashioned, bedrock solidity.\"people are looking for a safe haven,\" roness said. \"big names make them feel safer.\" but such security can be fleeting, especially amid current market conditions. the investing herd no longer seems to be moving in search of fresh food, but rather away from perceived danger rustling the tall grass. such behavior suggests volatility will only increase as panicky traders go into duck-and-cover mode every time things get ugly.certainly that's how it's played out with leading tech stocks. only about a week since compaq (cpq) issued a scary warning that its quarterly income would be about half the estimated amount -- sending its share price spiraling downward -- the company's stock was down an additional 88 cents at $22.75 after pfeiffer was handed his walking papers.compaq's chairman, benjamin rosen, will now serve as one of three acting ceos until a full-time replacement for pfeiffer can be found. rosen specifically cited the pc maker's less-than-stellar performance over the past couple of years, during which it acquired both digital equipment and tandem computers, as being behind the changes in the executive suite.merrill lynch analyst steve milunovich said pfeiffer's ouster \"will prove positive for compaq\" in the long run, although \"leadership uncertainty, particularly in such a fast-moving industry, will likely put pressure on compaq's ability to execute on current business and the remaining pieces of the digital integration.\"it put pressure as well on other pc-related stocks. dell computer (dell) shed $2.81 to $35.44, and international business machines (ibm) was down $3.44 at $166.94. microsoft (msft) dropped $5.63 to $81, while intel (intc) was $1.75 lower at $55.50 even as it announced a tie-up with nbc to enhance interactive features for digital tv broadcasts.net stocks, meantime, lost the wind from their sails as mary meeker, morgan stanley dean witter's powerful industry guru, told the new yorker that \"a big correction\" is looming for online outfits. she compared the current boom for all things dot com to the nuttiness that surrounded tulips in holland back in the late 17th century, a fad that saw prices go through the roof before the market eventually collapsed.amazon.com (amzn) declined 16 percent to $158.94, and america online (aol) was down 17 percent at $116. yahoo (yhoo) fell 13 percent to $163.69, and etrade group (egrp) slid 20 percent to $73.81.one net stock -- sort of -- that bucked the downtrend was usabancshares (usab), which jumped 31 percent to $14.25 after unveiling new online banking services. as for why introduction of something as mundane as online banking should boost the company's stock so significantly, well, that's another matter. tulip, anyone?lots of action in telecom. qwest communications international (qwst) was unchanged at $82 as bellsouth purchased a 10 percent stake in the fiber-optic carrier for about $3.5 billion. qwest said a marketing tie-up between the two companies should add approximately $500 million to its revenues over the next five years. bellsouth has an option to expand its stake to 20 percent in the future.mci worldcom (wcom) slipped $2.50 to $82.25 after agreeing to purchase cai wireless systems for as much as $408 million. the deal is a boon for both firms. mci has been actively looking to acquire wireless assets, while cai has been in need of a sugar daddy since emerging from bankruptcy protection late last year.for its part, lucent technologies (lu) slid $4.56 to $52.38 even as it announced landing an order to provide $300 million in network gear to us west. the telco is upgrading its system to handle a higher volume of voice and data traffic.lastly, they were playing hardball over in energy. consolidated natural gas (cng) climbed $3.56 to $56 after columbia energy launched a nearly $7 billion hostile takeover bid for the company, aiming to trump a friendly $5.5 billion purchase by dominion resources. columbia's offer represents a 21 percent premium over dominion's proposal.cng said it will review columbia's overture, but dominion maintained it had a \"definitive\" merger agreement on the table. must be nice being so darn popular."}
