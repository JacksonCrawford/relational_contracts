[with the algorithm] you send this nose, eyes, and mouth -- it's a more compact way of assembling this image. it reconstructs the face.\"another application for the algorithm might be a super-smart web search that would look for word combinations and proper context, weeding out the irrelevant matches, rather than searching for a single keyword, lee said.the program could learn to distinguish between synonyms, such as documents that pertain to the metal \"lead\" and those that pertain to \"leadership.\"\"right now the search is based on keywords. [the program] is able to break down topics into constituent topics,\" lee said. \"it can automatically learn how words are used in combination.... research could become much more relevant.\""}
