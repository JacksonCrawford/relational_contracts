[the allegations] are flat-out libelous and there's no proof to it. it's an attempt to destroy, defame, and discredit me.\"vranesevich's detractors were already inflamed over his recent apparent shift in allegiance. on friday, vranesevich posted an editorial on his web site that stated he was working with the air force and other government agencies to help track down crackers.\"a little note to the thousands of hackers that read this site,\" vranesevich warned, \"i have been watching you these past five years. i know how you do the things you do, why you do the things you do, and i know who you are.\"his warnings have stirred the ire of attrition.org, led by brian martin (who goes by the name jericho). martin said he has been following vranesevich's case for more than a year.martin based his claims on two emails that allegedly show vranesevich had a business relationship with \"so1o,\" the hacker accused of breaking into senate.gov last year. vranesevich said the emails displayed on martin's site \"never existed.\"another chronicler of the computer security underground said that vranesevich's reputation is less than pristine.\"he has made a lot of enemies over the years,\" said space rogue, editor of the hacker news network. \"this particular accusation has been unproven for awhile. it's been thought that this has been going on for some time, that he was paying people or was in league with them.\"space rogue cited one particular revelation in vranesevich's friday statement.\"many times, i knew about these instances [site hacks] beforehand, and could have stopped them,\" vranesevich wrote.\"that basically for me solidifies everything in the attrition report,\" space rogue said.vranesevich said that he has never been popular with the underground hacker culture because of what he's done to expose it. \"i often say that they hack a site first and make up a manifesto second,\" vranesevich said.he points to his press citations in recent weeks, which include mentions in the new york times, abc news, and cnn. he also said that government agencies such as nasa rely on him to provide data on hacker profiles.but while martin accuses vranesevich of using his fame as a platform to prosperity, vranesevich says he doesn't charge those agencies for access to data and will probably keep the information free of charge forever.\"i think my track record speaks for itself,\" vranesevich said. \"i'm proud of how i've accomplished and what i've accomplished.\""}
