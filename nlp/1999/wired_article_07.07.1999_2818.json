[some] people just take it to the nth degree.\"the patient fully recovered from his self-inflicted wounds and medication has his psychosis under control.another patient, who was 41, thought he was a witch webmaster and ran an online service giving advice to new witches. he believed his powers were so strong that he could surf the net using only his mind.\"sometimes when we were talking to him, he would stare straight ahead, then say, 'sorry i was at someone's web site,'\" catalano said."}
