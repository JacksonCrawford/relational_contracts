takes a look at the games most likely to be winners this season. by noah shachtman.", "author": "noah shachtman", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "11.02.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "for gamers, crushing your enemy is no longer enough. now, you've got to understand what makes him tick. the hottest games this holiday season are going to be those that require players to be quick-witted and quick with the gamepad.usually, videogame plots and character development are at roughly the porno flick or usa network level -- no more than excuses to get to the action. but narrative has begun to play a more prominent role in this fall's harvest of videogames.as christian svensson, editor in chief of the videogame trade magazine mcv reports, \"consumers are demanding more of an experience, more than just a game. there has to be drama, has to be emotion involved. and that only comes from a story.\"building that sense of drama is one of the keys to the success of the critical and popular hit homeworld. and the stunning detail of its 3d graphics doesn\u2019t hurt.the game begins with the discovery of an ancient starship in the desert of the planet kharak. at the ship's center is a stone, carved with a map of the galaxy and a single word in the kharak language: \"our home.\" it inspires the fractious people of kharak to unite in a quest for identity. it\u2019s the player's job to lead the kharak fleet to its long-lost planet of origin.like in other real-time strategy (rts) games, homeworld players accomplish their goal by completing a series of smaller missions, all of which have the same basic objectives: to amass resources, build up a fleet, and wipe out all potential threats.the missions aren\u2019t dull. between-mission animated sequences and in-game plot twists, the player is emotionally driven to complete the star wars-sized quest. players are genuinely bummed when kharak is torched by alien invaders, and seethe with revenge when catching up to the culprits.other rts games use similar tactics to draw the player in. age of empires ii: age of kings, for example, puts users in the combat boots of genghis khan, joan of arc, william wallace, and other military leaders from history.but, as hollywood studios and book publishers learned long ago, it's not easy to craft a winning story line. game-makers' efforts in the narrative arena often turn out downright laughable. witness the ridiculous command & conquer: tiberian sun.james earl jones stars in the mission-bookending cinematics. as in homeworld and age of kings, the short videos that run between game levels are meant to enhance the drama of the game. but in this case, the stilted dialogue and comatose performances provide comic relief.even with their sometimes-feeble attempts at plot, rts games like age of kings and command & conquer now dominate the computer game market. combined with dungeons & dragons-style role-playing games (rpgs), which have traditionally had dominant narrative themes, they make up for almost 50 percent of all games sold, according to mcv.that shouldn't come as a surprise. with new games commanding retail prices of us$45 and up, gamers want hours and hours of entertainment for their investment. many publishers are finding that tougher monsters or cooler graphics alone won't do the trick. but when these elements are tied together with a strong story, they keep coming back.more than 60 percent of all game sales come in the fourth quarter of the year. so there's a torrent of titles trying to make the holiday rush. makers of asheron's call and ultima ascension are hoping to supplant everquest as the most addictive rpg. but the most anticipated game in the space, diablo ii, has been long delayed, and now looks like it won't ship until 2000.many games outside of the strategy area, especially shoot-em-ups, are bucking the narrative trend. don't plan on getting attached to any characters in unreal tournament. no one lives long enough. and quake 3, which has been out in beta for months but may not ship officially until next year, isn't about to let plot get in the way of its non-stop killing action.even in the first-person bloodbaths, the story is beginning to matter.for example, the creepy, tense system shock 2 keeps players involved far longer than seems rational, in large part because the mystery of what is happening to the unn starship von braun. taunts from the ship's hal-like computer (xerxes), scolding from the player's benefactor (dr. janice polito), and logs and emails from the ship's crew combine to form an enveloping experience.\"i have never played a game that pulled me into itself so deeply that time and real life commitments lost all meaning. immersive, dark, and at times really scary -- that's system shock 2,\" emails one gamer, \"micherle.\"similar reports about titles like the 1997 interpretation of blade runner, laid the foundations for game makers' current enthusiasm for plot. blade runner's appeal came on the back of a story strong enough to be favorably compared with the classic sci-fi noir film upon which it was based. the game's been a blueprint ever since."}
