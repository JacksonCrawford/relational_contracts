[other treatments] will make the blood vessel larger, but it re-narrows because it's injured from the treatment.\"up to 20 percent of patients over 70 have circulation problems in their legs, said rockson. these types of problems make it difficult or impossible for patients to walk without pain.the researchers plan to show the procedure's efficiency against a much bigger enemy -- coronary artery blockage -- as part of the phase ii studies planned for the fall.pharmacyclics is also seeking fda approval on a different version of the same drug for treating breast cancer that has spread to the skin."}
