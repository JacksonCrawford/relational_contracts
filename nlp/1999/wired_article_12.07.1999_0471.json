surprising new research indicates male infertility can be a genetic trait passed from fathers to sons. scientists say the findings may one day produce male contraceptives and new treatments for male infertility.\"it's the first case where we have a precise identification of the genetic defect that causes infertility,\" said howard hughes medical institute researcher david page of the whitehead institute for biomedical research at mit.while male infertility is extremely common -- affecting two percent of all males, according to page -- researchers have long been stumped by its origins.\"until the last 5 or 6 years ago, most investigators looked to environmental causes, like chemical exposures, infections, or immune disorders\" to understand male infertility, said page.a genetic explanation didn't seem to make sense. how could an infertile man pass down an infertility gene when, in theory, he wasn't able to produce offspring?\"most people didn't get beyond the idea of what genetics is -- the study of disease passed on in families,\" page said, especially as it relates to infertility.page's research, published in the current issue of <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"externallink\",\"outgoingurl\":\"http://genetics.nature.com/\"}' href=\"http://genetics.nature.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">nature genetics</a> shows that genetics and infertility can indeed go hand-in-hand.\"the mutation can be new,\" page explained. \"it's difficult to imagine how mutations would be passed from one generation to the next. but what if they arise anew?\"given that about 20 percent of infertile men have missing \"chunks\" in three regions of their y chromosomes, page's challenge was to identify which missing gene was critical for producing quality sperm.page and his research team first determined the entire dna sequence of one of the three missing regions on the y chromosome. after determining that only two genes were involved, they tested the gene sequence in 576 infertile men.with more than 800,000 letters to the region, sequencing part of the y chromosome's dna was complicated enough. but the truly painstaking research came when page's team had to sift through and compare the genetic data of the study participants, looking for variants in the dna.\"that's really like looking for a needle in a haystack,\" he said. \"try searching through [the dna of] 576 men and finding the one spelling error.\"page's team found dna sequence variations in five of the 576 men. in four cases, the variant had no direct effect on fertility. but in one male, he found a smoking gun.five of the infertile males carried variant versions of the gene, named usp9y. but dna sequence deviations proved harmless in four of the five subjects, since they also showed up in a fertile brother or father. in one male, however, the variant was not present in his fertile brother, despite the fact that the two brothers had inherited the same y chromosome from their father, according to the study.\"these mutations are likely to be new mutations,\" page said. \"it must have appeared for the first time in this male and therefore is an excellent candidate for causing his infertility.\"page cautioned that his work was not the definitive answer to male sterility. \"we are not announcing a public health breakthrough,\" he said. rather, \"we have found strong evidence for the existence of a gene on the human y chromosome that plays a critical role in the production of sperm.\"uc davis genetics professor r. scott hawley said the findings were \"the first step toward finding a bunch of genes that are responsible for infertility. now [page] can figure out what those genes do, and what role they play.\"a cure for male infertility is still a long way off, however.\"are we going to be able to provide treatment for these men?\" hawley asked. \"probably not, i don\u2019t see how to get those [missing] genes back in.\"nevertheless, hawley said he was optimistic about page's contribution to the improved methods of fertilization, such as sperm injection.but page is already thinking about the birth control possibilities.\"wouldn't it be interesting if it were possible to give a pill to men that would temporarily shut off sperm production and act as a male contraceptive? ... it would have the same effect as the gene which, when mutated, makes men infertile but doesn't harm the health,\" page explained. \"such genes are good targets for developing contraceptives.\""}
