maybe they get their best bid from a guy in portugal,\" says workman.that's the theory anyway -- gofish won't launch until 19 november. when it does, the goal is to bring together a critical mass of fish buyers and sellers in an auction where each would get the best possible deal on the freshest stuff out there, wherever it might be. \"your product will always be at the right place at the right time,\" workman said.gofish will have industry news, sea conditions, a reference library and a credit check so sellers can insure they won't get stiffed by a buyer with a bad record. the predecessor to gofish, a credit-check and collection company called seafax, founded by workman, has a huge database of credit information on seafood buyers. \"we're the dun & bradstreet of the seafood industry,\" workman said.making credit checks fast \"is really important if you're selling melting ice cubes.\"while similar business-to-business auction sites are springing up in most industries, the net is especially suited to the seafood biz, workman said (nascent competitors, including fishbuyer.com and fishmart.com, agree).\"fish is the last food we hunt for,\" he said. \"you never know what you'll have tomorrow. you just say, hey, look what i found in my nets today.\"that randomness and uncertainty isn't well-suited to a fragmented market where a few brokers might be in touch with a few buyers. if no one wants what you've got, too bad. with a world of buyers, someone's gonna want it, workman said.while workman's plan has been well received by seafood industry bigwigs and venture capitalists (gofish just scooped up $9.5 million in first-round financing), it's less popular with the thousands of seafood brokers who yearly take a $6 billion cut on sales.\"in any marketplace that's as big and fragmented as this, you're going to have some inefficiencies,\" workman says, sidestepping a question about the future of fish brokers.but, he adds, the net may rob one of the brokers of their most powerful tool -- control of information about what's available for sale. \"the invisible hand of business is misinformation,\" he said, paraphrasing adam smith.he offers an example: say a buyer calls a broker and says he's looking for 20,000 pounds of shrimp x. the broker is sitting on 40,000 pounds of shrimp x, but he says, golly, that's going to be hard to come by -- it's gonna cost you.cut out the broker, the potential for such abuse disappears. \"the better educated the buyer, the better deal he's going to get,\" workman said.and if workman makes a few brokers mad, well, what the heck? after years as a debt collector, he isn't afraid of confrontation.\"i once took an $89 flight from maine to san leandro, california, to collect a $4,800 debt,\" he said. \"i just sat in the guy's office -- ordered pizza, hung around. i wasn't going to leave until he paid.\"at seafood industry trade shows, workman used to set up a ticker board above seafax's booth that flashed the names of all the deadbeat debtors in the industry.still, the brokers are safe for awhile.\"this is a business as ancient as civilization,\" workman said. \"it's not going to go away in internet time.\""}
