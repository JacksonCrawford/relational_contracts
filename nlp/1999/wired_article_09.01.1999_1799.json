a temporary installation about sensory deprivation and overload, according to project architect eric bunge.call it \"textitecture.\" photographs screened onto prefab concrete and glass panels cover herzog & de meuron's new library at the eberswalde senior technical school outside berlin. three wide glass belts separate the concrete layers and allow sunlight to pour deep into the brick-shaped edifice.this humble church in santo domingo, chile, may be the epitome of modern architecture - it simply couldn't have been built without digital technology. still, the iglesia de la santa maria de las brisas, a structure of serenity and ancient beauty, cleverly veils its high tech design. only slowly, as the sun creeps westward, casting its light through the slit windows to form a sundial pattern on the interior walls, is the subtle genius of the church revealed. mit professor fernando domeyko employed innovative lighting-simulation software to create the structure's stonehenge effect. an acoustic simulation presaged the hanging curved ceiling, which makes electronic amplification unnecessary. still more bit crunching helped shape the curved concrete panels of the 2,000-square-foot building, which - located in an earthquake zone - must be seismically faultless."}
