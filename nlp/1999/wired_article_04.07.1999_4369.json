perhaps it has something to do with speculation that usa networks is going to up the ante in its bid to merge the portal with its electronic-retailing assets. rumors of such a move sent lycos' shares soaring 20 percent on tuesday. now that traders have had a chance to think about it some more, and to recall usa's repeated insistence that it isn't about to change the terms of the deal, they're pocketing their cash and making a hasty retreat.more on all the rumor fun in a moment.merrill lynch may not be sure about the company's earnings prospects, but hewlett-packard (hwp) tried to turn things around by announcing price cuts for some of its pcs. it didn't work. hp lost 25 cents to $69.75, while compaq (cpq) was down 69 cents at $30.19.software maker network associates (neta) dropped 27 percent to $16 after warning that its first-quarter income will only be around 31 cents a share. investors, who had been anticipating 48 cents, were not amused.lastly, the rumor patrol. traders were buzzing about america online (aol) after the san jose mercury news dusted off a nugget about the world's biggest online service making a bid for cbs (cbs). neither company opted to comment on the speculation, which has been making the rounds for months, along with rumors that aol is shopping for all sorts of other companies.so why is such talk getting people all worked up again?\"rumors on wall street are there for a reason,\" abn amro's appleby replied. \"because they're true.\"ah. that explains it. nevertheless, aol fell $10.50 to $157, and cbs was down 6 cents at $43.63."}
