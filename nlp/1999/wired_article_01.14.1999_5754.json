(legal fine print: lycos is in the process of acquiring wired news.)in a sure sign that net shares retain an undeniable mystique for traders, especially those of the day variety, a no-neck firm called interiors (intxl) saw its stock skyrocket $1.19, or 211 percent, to $1.75 after the maker of decorative accessories said it will launch an interiors.com site and open an outlet in yahoo's cyber-mall.similarly, sunglass hut international (rays) advanced $1.88, or 25 percent, to $9.25 after announcing its acquisition of a couple of electronic retailers, shades.com and swissarmydepot.com. morgan stanley dean witter boosted its rating for sunglass hut to \"strong buy\" from \"neutral.\"in tech, apple computer (aapl) fell $3.25 to $43.25 on worries that the company won't be able to sustain its holiday-sales momentum into the next quarter. on wednesday, apple reported better-than-expected quarterly profit of 78 cents a share, excluding one-time gains. it was the fifth consecutive money-making quarter for the rejuvenated firm.chipmaker advanced micro devices (amd) tumbled $4.75, or 17 percent, to $23 after revealing that its own quarterly earnings came up short of analysts' expectations. the company saw profit of 15 cents a diluted share, whereas the street was looking for at least 19 cents. rival intel (intc) was $4.25 lower at $134.75.cisco systems (csco) climbed $1.63 to $97.50 as morgan stanley dean witter raised its 12-month price target for the company's stock to $120. dell computer (dell) rose $1.13 to $78.19, while microsoft (msft) dropped 31 cents to $143.50.lastly, golden books family entertainment (gbfe), a publisher of kids' books, surged $1.06, or 142 percent, to $1.81 after the new york times reported that disney (dis) had bought a stake in the firm. neither company confirmed the story, but seeing as golden books opened trading at less than a buck a share, why take chances?"}
