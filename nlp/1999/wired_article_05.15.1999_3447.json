reaches the new economy -- one rutted with red tape and monopolies. a few more credit cards would help, too. declan mccullagh reports from buenos aires.", "author": "declan mccullagh", "category":

who will be the richest man in argentina lives,\" he says. the snarl and stench of the nerve-jangling traffic nearly drown out the joke.guerra is, of course, talking about himself, and is pointing to his apartment in a fashionable area of town overlooking of the city's major thoroughfares.the 27-year old entrepreneur hopes to cash in on latin america's growing interest in the internet with a web consulting business he co-founded with his brother. argus communications now employs nine people and helps firms craft sites and e-commerce plans. guerra has more ambitious plans, too, including setting up an online order and home-delivery business.the potential market is vast. the number of spanish-speaking people online is expected to double in 1999, from 14 million users at the beginning of the year to 34 million by the end, according to the latin american arm of saatchi & saatchi worldwide.spanish is estimated to be the second most popular language on the internet. it is more prevalent online than french, german, or japanese.yet internet start-ups remain a rarity in argentina. government officials are at least partly to blame. the ubiquitous bureaucrats may be well meaning but inevitably turn out to be a major joy-kill for endlessly optimistic college kids hoping to be the next bill gates.argentina's internet connections with the outside world are at the mercy of the two telintar companies, which together enjoy a government-supported and oft-cursed monopoly that is viewed with the same affection that most americans hold for the irs.telintar execs seem to take pride in playing the role of rapacious monopolist in a shakespearean drama that would put the microsoft management team to shame.the result: high-speed internet connections are 50 to 100 times as expensive than they are in the united states. as of the end of 1998, a 128 kbps line typically costs about us$4,477 a month. the sheer nefariousness of this perfectly legal price-gouging scheme is as easy to criticize as it is to crash windows 98, but the situation is hardly unique to argentina.unlike the united states, which managed to get rid of its ma bell monopoly in the '80s, latin american countries generally have been more reluctant to embrace the free market. in the neighboring country of uruguay, for example, the telecom industry is still smarting from decades of military rule.argentine companies are eagerly awaiting limited deregulation, due in late 1999. until then, they struggle to survive.start-ups can be found, like just about everything in the country, in downtown buenos aires. netizen, a medium-sized internet provider, has its offices in a third-floor walk-up on avenue peru, just a few blocks from the square where irate students have spent this week protesting budget cuts.netizen -- which borrowed its name from the former hotwired channel -- has 24 analog and 90 digital lines for dialup customers, and plans to boost that number to 128 digital lines by the end of the month. its partners include mercado, a popular business magazine, and the universidad virtual quilmes, which has plopped a powerful sun ultra enterprise 3000 server in the netizen office. the 3-year-old company says about 1,200 home users now subscribe.but the path to online commerce in this country is also blocked at the consumer end by a lack of widespread credit-card use and support.\"two years ago, it was unusual to find anyone with a credit card,\" says sebastian bellagamba, netizen's director of distance education. mindful of previous bank problems, many argentines don't have savings accounts, either. other companies complain it's nearly impossible to find local banks willing to do online credit-card verification.investors also appear to be eyeing the larger economies of mexico and brazil, where millions more people have internet accounts. \"it's not so easy here to go public,\" bellagamba laments.as is the case throughout latin america, corruption is widespread in argentina. an editor at a popular buenos aires business newspaper said government officials talk openly of handing cash bribes to journalists.robert schmidt, the president of washington dc-based integration communications international, a wireless firm, has similar stories to tell. \"what i found is that the welcome mat has not been out,\" he said.but that isn't stopping companies like america online, which plans to open up shop here at the end of the year. and telecommunications deregulation should help.people here just don't yet spend that much time online because flat-rate local phone service, normal in the united states, doesn't exist in argentina where people pay by the minute to log on.\"the phone is so expensive you look around for information and then you log off. as soon as we get a flat rate telephone rate for data exchange, all this is going to change,\" said vanesa kolodziej, who works at argus communications and has written about the internet for patagon.com."}
