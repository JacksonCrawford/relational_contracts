swayed by the federal reserve bank's influence - joined to provide liquidity for the failing hedge fund, whose collapse would have threatened financial stability.the system called japan that does not make people happy is the title (roughly translated) of a recent van wolferen best-seller in japan. in it, he speaks to japanese readers distressed by the social cost of the system's amalgamated political and business bureaucracy. due out this fall, van wolferen's latest book, tentatively called the end of japanese gloom and to be published by mainichi shimbunsha, builds on his earlier themes. but his work addresses audiences outside japan as well. director of the newly founded institute for comparative political and economic institutions at the university of amsterdam, van wolferen challenges scholars and students to recognize the profound global differences in economic practice concealed in a fog of meaningless phrasemaking about the magic of markets.van wolferen, 58, left rotterdam in 1960, intending to hitchhike through india. he didn't set foot in the netherlands again until 1967. after two years in india and southeast asia, he moved to japan, which became his base during 36 years of travel and reporting. as a foreign correspondent for the major dutch daily nrc handelsblad, van wolferen became intimately familiar with the techniques the japanese bureaucracy uses to manage the press. \"it became an intellectual challenge,\" he says. \"'how can i understand this place?' that challenge has not disappeared. it continues to be, in some ways, more baffling for me.\"wired: what happened to the japanese crisis? the big news last year was the coming reformation of japan, but this has disappeared from the press.van wolferen: first of all, there was no crisis. there are tremendous problems, but there was no crisis in the sense of a temporary condition in which things come to a head and either collapse or are purged and cleaned up. by the beginning of 1998, the us treasury was pointing its finger at japan and saying, \"you guys are in trouble.\" in a context of the larger asian crisis, us treasury secretary robert rubin seemed to have had the idea that he could help provoke major financial and industrial reform in japan. the japanese officials who heard this were sort of amused. people came to japan to cover the crisis, and they couldn't find ordinary japanese to talk about it. after a few months, the officials had to accommodate the journalists. if the foreign press wanted to talk about a crisis, they could talk about it.is this just semantics? there were problems but not a crisis?if it were understood, i think you'd see different policies - different american policies toward japan and also different policies inside japan. to put this in perspective, you must realize that you have a financial system based on different incentives than those in free-market capitalist countries like the united states. in the us, you invest for the purpose of making a profit. in japan's postwar system, investments were made not for profit but for gaining industrial strength. japan wanted to become not rich, but strong. the japanese economy is basically a war economy operating in peacetime. in the eyes of western economists, in the eyes of the imf and the us treasury, this is a sin. but a sin against what? against an economic model that they believe is the only way to run an economy.it worked very well for a long time. however, it became clear even in the '70s that japanese expansion of productive capacity could not go on forever. the world demand simply wasn't sufficient. there should have been a switch or a gradual shift of emphasis toward developing a fully fledged consumer economy so that the japanese middle class, the japanese consumers, could help support this enormous apparatus that had come into being. and there also had to be gradual adjustments away from the emphasis on unlimited expansion to an emphasis on actual profit making. this adjustment has never been made.but hasn't japan been punished for its mistakes, just as us economists have said?these people are overlooking 50 years of economic development in which a country, defeated and devastated by the worst war in history, pulled itself up to become the number-two industrial power in the world. go look for books written by economists explaining this! you won't find them.the standard explanation for japan's postwar success is not its economic or political system, but its culture. by applying the lessons of market capitalism with just a little more intensity and intelligence, it has managed to outcompete many western nations.hard work, seriousness, and dedication do not explain the economic miracle. the explanation is that japan has a credit system where there is a collective understanding of which industries ought to be encouraged and stimulated and made strong. this system ensures that the people in those industries will have access to an unimpeded flow of funds and that they do not need to show a profit. they can go for 10 years fighting for international market share and be losing all the time. there is not a single american or european firm that can do this.how is this system directed? japan is not a centralized economy in the classic sense.rather than looking at the market as a pivotal economic institution, you should look at another institution that doesn't have an official name. i call it credit ordering. this is not what you read about in the press: \"government support for insolvent banks.\" it is a whole system in which you cannot draw a line between the private and public sectors. the overloan system - the period from the 1950s until about the late '60s - was a good example of this. the banks at the center of these clusters of companies were allowed to expand their lending to these companies without being required to have deposits with the central bank that were in proportion to the loans. this has supported the stock market and real estate bubbles. in the 1980s, the land in tokyo itself and the surrounding areas where tokyo commuters live was worth as much as all the land in the united states, plus all the assets of all the companies listed on the new york stock exchange. this, of course, is insane. the japanese have demonstrated that it is possible to shake money from trees, or create it out of nothing.in john kenneth galbraith's a short history of financial euphoria, he mentions that \"financial operations do not lend themselves to innovation.\" when you seem to discover that you can create money out of nothing, you are simply looking at increased leverage - or more credit for less collateral. when there is a significant attempt to get back into cash, the leverage works in reverse, causing a chain reaction of defaults and deflation - a crash. this seems to be what happened in japan.except there was no crash. there have also been no fundamental changes in policy. land and stock prices have come down, but not nearly as much as they should have.there has certainly been a crash in other asian countries.the big difference between japan and the tiger countries is that the japanese officials always made absolutely sure they would never be at the mercy of capricious foreigners. the koreans and the thai and the malaysians opened themselves to foreign investments in a way that made them extraordinarily vulnerable, and the moment they started to take away the protective force around their financial systems, you had this crazy capital flow in and out of these countries. japan didn't have that problem, ever.you have written that the imf recipes for asia are wrong, that they are recipes for poverty and dislocation. who will be impoverished and dislocated?look at asia now. it would be wrong to blame the imf and its personnel for things that it was never set up to cope with, but you can fault the imf for its apparent lack of desire to better understand the historical background in asia. had it approached these countries and their problems from a historical perspective, the imf would not have been so quick in simply applying the standard recipe for restoring investor confidence. it would not have raved about inflation in these countries. it would not have emphasized interest rates. it would have seen that what these countries needed more than anything else was a better-developed consumer economy. then the consumers could absorb the products that the hypertrophied production apparatus was spewing out.so there was a crisis of demand?exactly. and raising interest rates was exactly the thing not to do. it was - as jeffrey sachs said in the case of thailand - like screaming \"fire!\" in a crowded theater. the so-called washington consensus is a term given to a collection of notions, revolving around the idea that deregulation and liberalization and privatization are great and they should be applied to the financial economy as much as to international trade. this set of ideas has been shown in the past year to be wrong.you said japan's credit-ordering system should be adjusted to shift the economy's focus from production to consumption. but in japan, there is a very wide range of consumer goods available, often beyond what is available in the united states.the prices are rigged - they are very high. the consumer credit is underdeveloped, and what you see in tokyo does not represent the whole country. if you look at japan as a whole and you see what people are able to buy and the credit they are able to get, you will see that it remains underdeveloped.so they are not watching dvd on home theater systems with surround sound?very few do. it is essentially something for the outside world, and manufacturers regulate domestic prices in accordance with what they need.hasn't japan, under pressure from the united states, done things to stimulate its domestic economy?the ministry of finance has done two things. first, it has increased infrastructural spending in the countryside. what happens is that the government covers hillsides in concrete, lines riverbeds with concrete, and builds bridges to nowhere. i could take you to where this construction is going on and you wouldn't believe it. but this keeps a construction mafia in business, which in turn supports local politicians, which helps keep the ruling party in office. this stimulus is not really working, because there is very little trickle-down effect. second, the ministry has pumped a lot of money into the banking system. whether this is really helping the economy is still unclear.and what should the government be doing? extending credit to consumers?it has never extended credit to individuals. it has never extended credit to households. in fact, it has never extended credit to the small entrepreneurs, the sub-subcontractors, for whom the situation today is very tragic. the entire financial system is set up to extract money from households and sluice it in only one direction - toward industrial production. so consumer credit is one thing that you must introduce. for the past 25 years, western economists, the wall street journal, the financial times, and so on have said that japan has too much government interference in business. but this is completely misunderstanding the structure of finance in japan. you can't take the government out of it, because the government is it. but you can change the priorities, and of course if you do, there will be a political consequence. you must make the consumer more important, you must help bring about a genuine middle class that has the power to fight for its interests and force the industrial system to adjust to its existence.who controls japanese policy?i recall when henry kissinger used to roam asia and would return through tokyo from beijing. he was always very frustrated. in china, he would talk with people who had visible power. but i always felt that when he was in tokyo, within himself he was screaming, \"take me to your leader!\" in japan, the cabinet meets for about 15 minutes, the day after a meeting of the vice ministers of every ministry. the vice ministers have reached a general understanding of what will and will not happen, and, during the cabinet meeting, the ministers just put their seals on the decisions made the previous day. i once shared a panel with naoto kan, who is the most important opposition figure at this moment and who is without any question the single most popular politician in japan because of his integrity and his clear opposition views. i said that a cabinet that meets only 20 minutes cannot be termed a real government. he said, \"mr. van wolferen was wrong about the length of the cabinet meetings. i have never attended a cabinet meeting that lasted more than a quarter of an hour.\"would you describe japan as a democracy?if you define democracy as a set of understandings between rulers and the ruled where you leave the people in relative freedom and you don't throw them in jail for opinions that are disliked by power holders - if you apply those standards, then japan is democratic. but if you say that democracy is a political system in which, in the end, the people are properly represented and their ideas or likes and dislikes are translated into political action, then japan is not. japanese tend to be extraordinarily skeptical about their own political system.are you suggesting that the united states and europe are models of political accountability?what accountability implies is that the power holders must explain to constituencies what they are doing and why. they explain it to others and thereby also explain it to themselves. in other words, accountability in a political system ensures that power holders have some idea of what they are doing and why. if they are no longer required to explain this, if accountability diminishes, then they also tend to lose an understanding of what they are doing. you can see this phenomenon all over the world, but japan is a laboratory for studying it. you have very capable administrators who are very effective in what they are doing for a very long time but who cannot change or reverse their policies. long ago, they lost perspective on what they are doing. there is no political entity in japan that can size up the situation, plan for systematic improvements on the basis of that analysis, and then implement whatever is necessary to bring about better conditions. this is of more than passing interest to non-japanese, because political accountability is diminishing in the united states. and as europe readies itself to adopt a common currency, you'll see in many respects that political accountability is disappearing there also.is there a desire inside japan for change?japanese society is changing all the time, but these changes are not necessarily in accordance with what the rest of the world, especially the west, believes japan should become, nor are they in accordance with what the japanese themselves would hope their society will become. in the past five or six years, i have written a number of books specifically for a japanese audience. they are about different subjects, but they ultimately return to a core theme, which is the possibility of realizing true democracy. when you speak to lawyers' organizations that are active on behalf of human rights and to media companies and labor unions, you realize the intense frustration that the japanese have. it is a very poignant experience.the japanese system does not evolve into something that people want. it is not under control. in fact, i find the japanese case intriguing because of the lack of control. things continue even though there is an understanding of how they could be ameliorated. things happen that people cannot stop."}
