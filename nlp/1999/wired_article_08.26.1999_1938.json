about 35 email-list subscriptions, a t1, and a chat client.see also: cmdrtaco on slashdot sale- - - - - -you can spot trends in the constant jet wash of internet hype. you can see the ripples that will create absurd wealth for some and throw others out on the street.now it is the middle of 1999, and you are watching one particular swirl developing in the storm that may eventually make your job obsolete.that's because a three-person web site called slashdot.org gets the scoop faster than you can -- along with about 600,000 news-hungry eyeballs a day.\"in a lot of ways, journalists have decided that journalism is something journalists do,\" said slashdot.org editor rob malda in an email. \"that's sort of elitist, but i won't piss on their parade and really contest that: we're just not journalists.\"\"that said, many traditional journalists think that something like slashdot might put them out of work,\" he said.slashdot represents what might be the beginning of the age of open-source journalism. it relies on the eyes and ears of the thousands of its readers to create what amounts to a collaborative newswire that tracks a specialized area of interest: \"news for nerds.\"it works like this: a slashdot reader points malda to something of interest -- a fragment on a web page, or a press release, or a newspaper story. anything, really. if the tidbit appeals, he posts it to the site as the first message in a discussion thread.the conversation that follows is part expert commentary, part peer review, and part cocktail-party banter, as credible sources and experts weigh in alongside crackpots in a rapid peer-review process.\"sometimes slashdot is reporting.... sometimes we're news,\" malda wrote. \"but mostly it's more like, 'there's something cool over here, what do you guys think?'\" and then the gang ... tries to have a rational -- or not so rational -- discussion.\"\"hopefully something valuable comes out of that. sometimes it does. sometimes it doesn't. but regardless, you have hundreds of voices instead of just one.\" in \"news in the slashdot decade,\" an essay posted to the site last month, member matthew priestley suggested that the site, and others based on a similar model, will fundamentally change news.\"while they remain in a state of infancy, the rise of sites such as slashdot and freerepublic herald the demise of traditional information flows,\" priestley wrote.not all journalists are ready for that vision. most see slashdot as a valuable part of the media scene, but ultimately little more than a tip sheet.\"i don't really ever consider them journalism, because they [usually just] link to other [news] sources,\" said zdnn tech news reporter mary jo foley.\"the slant is so weird,\" foley said, citing a recent slashdot-linked interview on the microsoft web site. \"what they highlight from the interview is not what a journalist would highlight. they like to highlight things that make microsoft look stupid.\"foley said she consults slashdot about five times a day for news leads.\"in this model you don't have editors deciding what is legitimate and what isn't,\" said jonathan dube, a senior associate producer with abcnews.com. \"the flip side is that you don't have [an editor's] assurance in what is to be trusted and what isn't to be trusted.\"rather, the sites offer a kind of self-regulating trust through the comments of respected sources who contribute to the news discussions, as priestley said in his essay.\"trading on the principles of self-interest and distributed trust, [sites such as slashdot] levy the expertise of thousands into producing honest, cheap daily news.\"joshua fouts, managing editor of the online journalism review, said that a special-interest journalism site such as slashdot can offer as legitimate a product as a traditional, name-brand news site.\"it is, in essence, a democratization of journalism from the consumer's end,\" he said, though he cautioned that readers must be more cautious than ever about trusting the sources. whenever discussing do-it-yourself reporting as exemplified by slashdot, traditional newshounds inevitably return to the issue of integrity and reliability. they say that consumers must rely on trained, professional journalists to ensure a report is unbiased and free of agendas.but as an advocacy community, slashdot is upfront about its biases. microsoft stories are identified with a graphic of bill gates looking like a borg from star trek: the next generation.in that sense, the site is no different from the tradition of alternative weekly newspapers published in just about every large american city -- papers that praise a few holy cows and lambaste regular targets.all that seems to be missing from slashdot-type sites is some kind of reputation rating system, where participants are assigned a trust rating based on feedback from the group and managed by a central authority. one such system is up and running on ebay, ensuring that buyers and sellers on the auction site can trust one other.\"with ebay you are trading goods. at slashdot you are trading ideas,\" said pc week reporter scott bernadito, who has been \"slashdotted\" -- or linked to from the site -- many times.\"it would be very easy for the community to say my ideas were not worth salt.\"a version of the ebay system is in place at slashdot. participants can earn moderation points, and readers can pick a threshold that will screen posts accordingly. registered users automatically begin with a higher rating than anonymous users.many journalists said they can't be bothered to plow through a long slashdot thread. but a rating system might also offer consumers the tools to filter the inevitable bozos and nut cases that make reading the site such a chore.true to the spirit of the site, malda makes the slashdot source code available to anyone who wants to replicate his model. a few sites are doing that, such as techdirt.com and dns policy, though none so successfully as the original.slashdot is \"news for nerds: stuff that matters,\" but there's nothing to stop any other special interest group -- whether they're baseball fans, amateur archeologists, or movie addicts -- from converging around the same code, and drawing eyeballs away from sites such as entertainment weekly online or espn.still, most connected journalists see traditional news sites co-existing with slashdot and the many special-interest news sites that are sure to follow on its heels.\"i still believe that people go to sites like wired news and pc week because they have this curiosity for the truth and this underlying belief that services [like slashdot] don't always get it right, and they need an independent verification,\" said berinato.on the other hand, he noted that slashdot thrives in an environment where people seek more and more fragmentation in their lives. \"instead of knowing something about a lot of things, we know a lot about a little.\""}
