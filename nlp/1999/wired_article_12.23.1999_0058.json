(ostrofsky wouldn't disclose the price tag for ebusiness.com and declined further comment on the matter.)big money was on the line, and ostrofsky wanted things cleared up pronto.network solutions made its position plenty clear: register.com had screwed up. the domain was already registered. sorry mr. rao. kiss ebusiness.com goodbye."}
