(the first totally robotic heart surgery, performed at the broussais hospital in paris last july, used a system developed by computer motion of goleta, california, but that system lacks any approval for testing in the united states.)\"it's like virtual surgery, but the surgeon is in constant control,\" said robert michler, chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the ohio state university medical center."}
