[but] we have people checking out these films from australia to zimbabwe,\" said thomas edwards, president of the sync, a content-heavy web site that has, for the past year, been running a monthly streaming video film festival.visitors to the site can view entries in any of six categories on-demand. viewers select the winners.\"there are a lot of small, local film festivals around the world,\" said edwards. \"the actual audience size might only be a few hundred people watching -- and for that, filmmakers have to print a copy of their film and ship it off, all of which costs a lot of money. with an online festival, you can have thousands of people watching your video.\"another online festival is the new venue, an ongoing showcase of films created specifically for the streaming medium. a project of d.film and stanford university, the new venue is the online counterpart to the traveling d.film digital film festival, a 90-minute pixelfeast that will hit 21 cities this year, including several screenings in park city next week.\"digital technology is really allowing the people with the best ideas to cut to the front of the line. you don't have to pay your dues as a camera operator in the union for five years before you get a chance to make something of your own,\" said bart cheever, executive producer of d.film. the new venue draws between 8,000 to 10,000 viewers per week. \"from a standpoint of the independent filmmaker who's trying to schlep a film around to festivals, having that many people see their film is quite attractive,\" said cheever. \"and it'll only get better as we grow and the technology advances.\"cheever and edwards both admit that the tiny, grainy streamed videos on their sites can't achieve the same impact of a 35mm film projected on the silver screen. yet.\"now it's nothing, it's a postage stamp,\" said cheever. \"but with high-bandwidth dsl (digital subscriber line) and cable modems and those kinds of things coming down the line, we'll definitely see the bandwidth coming in the next few years.\"when it's possible to stream full-screen video over the net, then anyone can become their own studio and distributor. at that point, the internet will become a powerful tool for digital filmmakers.\"while digital technology has obviously had an enormous impact on hollywood films with titanic-size budgets, it is also transforming the indie landscape. two breakout hits in the past year, the cruise and celebration (which won the jury prize at the prestigious cannes film festival), were 'filmed' with digital video cameras that cost less than most traditional filmmakers spend on raw film stock.\"especially in the last year, the industry's becoming very aware of what's going on with inexpensive digital technology,\" said jonathan wells, editor of <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"externallink\",\"outgoingurl\":\"http://www.resmag.com\"}' href=\"http://www.resmag.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">res magazine</a>, a publication devoted to digital filmmaking. \"digital technology isn't just about cheap technology; it's creating a whole new aesthetic.\"wells' res media also runs resfest, a traveling showcase of digitally created films.festivals like resfest and d.film are capitalizing on the fact that much of the cutting-edge work can't even qualify for sundance, which requires that filmmakers submit their work in 35mm film format, even if it was shot in digital video.\"we're in the early days of this medium,\" said cheever. \"but this will be a huge phenomenon 10 years down the road ... i believe it will revitalize the film industry.\""}
