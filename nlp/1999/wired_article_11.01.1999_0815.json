(ahem.) the secret is the totally mad cd-rom collection, seven discs containing the entire body of work produced by mad magazine's \"usual gang of idiots\" from 1952 to 1998, along with sound clips from flexidiscs and video interviews with mad contributors.to navigate totally mad, click on a thumbnail of a cover. most of the pages are black and white, since only the first few issues were printed in color. the pages are scanned from old magazines, not the original art, so sometimes you get the bonus of an unknown reader's drool stain on a page. the reproductions are good, but they don't print out very nicely - the grayscale tones are messed up - and the discs don't provide a true keyword search, because the text is scanned in as an image. some poor sap had to index the entire run by hand, which means there are some gaps.the set does have some special features, but they really don't add much to the experience. you can search for subjects, which is kind of nice, and animated cartoons from the mad tv show are included, as are interactive fold-ins (those picture puzzles on the inside back cover), but there is only one truly great thing about the cd-rom collection (and it is a great thing): you have every single back issue of mad for 70 bucks - and it's all small enough to fit inside one of alfred e. neuman's floppy ears.totally mad: $70. broderbund: (888) 829 3343, www.broderbund.com.street credhedgehog blissgone postalget back to workthe law of the codespeakers, medium raremonster rumbleemail made easyreadmemusicdrag and dropmad as hellvan vs. peaamphibious assaultjust outta betatunes from the cryptrediscovered rantscontributors"}
