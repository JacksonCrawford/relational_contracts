look no further than broadcast.com, which advanced for a fourth straight session as a stock split was announced. less than a week ago, it's worth remembering, the company's shares were trading at almost a fourth their current price.the dow jones industrial average shed 23.43 points to close at 9619.89, and the s&p 500 was 11.28 lower at 1263.81. the nasdaq composite index gained 39.61 to a record 2384.02, and the wired index was up 16.60 at 645.21.\"partnering is what it's all about,\" said william kurtz, an analyst with hg wellington & co. \"everyone is trying to make the best arrangements before the other guys do.\"case in point: compaq computer (cpq) will fork over us$220 million in ready cash to acquire electronic retailer shopping.com (ibuy). the deal is intended to bolster compaq's altavista portal with a more substantial e-commerce component. the pc maker advanced $2.69 to $48.06, while shopping.com soared $5.41, or 41 percent, to $18.59.meanwhile, yahoo (yhoo) vaulted $72.38, or 21 percent, to $416 -- that's right, $416 -- after announcing an accord with international business machines for big blue's aptiva pcs to feature built-in links to the portal's services. traders are also looking ahead to yahoo reporting an expected quarterly profit of 16 cents a share on tuesday.but that's yahoo. as for broadcast.com (bcst) -- go figure. the online media outfit went ballistic on friday for no better reason than having given a respectable performance at a new york investment conference. now it's up another $87.56, or 44 percent, at $285.06 on word of a two-for-one stock split. the split will affect shareholders of record as of 1 february.wellington's kurtz, like most show-me-the-fundamentals analysts, is at a loss to explain the overheated gains by net stocks, except that individual investors seem to be maintaining the momentum out of conviction that there's virtually no limit to how high these shares can climb. the bubble, he warned, could pop at any time. \"i wouldn't do any buying of these stocks,\" kurtz said.what's profit got to do with it? etrade group (egrp) advanced $20.88, or 31 percent, to $88.50 even as it reported a quarterly loss of 23 cents a diluted share, blaming the shortfall on recent marketing efforts to woo new customers. analysts had been expecting a loss of 30 cents, so the company was deemed to be performing up to snuff.what the world really needs, though, is another online auction house. luckily, here's sharper image (shrp), the purveyor of upscale toys, saying it will add an auction service to its web site. the company's stock rocketed $8.25, or 67 percent, to $20.63.not to be outdone, ticketmaster online-citysearch (tmcs) gained $10.63, or 19 percent, to $67.50 after saying it will acquire cityauction, which boasts about 47,000 registered users.say it to yourself: \"online auctions ... online auctions ... online auctions.\" sounds like praying, doesn't it?elsewhere on the net, infoseek (seek) surged $32.63, or 59 percent, to $87.75, and lycos (lcos), soon-to-be parent of wired news, was up $39.25, or 43 percent, at $131. amazon.com (amzn) accelerated $24.38, or 15 percent, to $184.63, and america online (aol) jumped $17, or 12 percent, to $163.50 as merrill lynch raised its price target for the stock to $195 a share.traders were wary of lucent technologies (lu) saying it will pay nearly $1.5 billion for kenan systems, a maker of customer-service applications, sending the company's stock down $2.31 to $112.94. if this price tag looked a bit steep, how will the market react to lucent shelling out $16 billion for network-equipment producer ascend communications? the financial times said such a deal could be announced as soon as wednesday.rumors of a lucent-ascend marriage have been making the rounds for months, and the two companies do look like a good fit. combining lucent's background in phone systems with ascend's savvy for data networks would make a merged entity a mighty influential rival to leader-of-the-pack cisco systems (csco). for what it's worth, cisco fell $2 to $104.69.among other tech movers, intel (intc) gained $9.75 to $139.44 as lehman brothers reiterated a \"buy\" rating for the chipmaker's stock. intel is expected to report quarterly profit of $1.07 a share tuesday, although some on the street already are whispering that a higher number will be revealed.data-network specialist banyan systems (bnyn) rose $3.50, or 24 percent, to $17.94 after forming an alliance with microsoft (msft). the self-professed provider of \"advanced enterprise solutions\" will receive $10 million from redmond over three years as it undoubtedly pushes windows nt or windows 2000 or whatever it's called as the be-all, end-all for business. microsoft slid $2.38 to $147.50.a good day for general motors (gm). the world's biggest car maker rose $6 to $86.06 after jp morgan securities reiterated a \"buy\" rating for the company's stock. gm said it built more vehicles in the fourth quarter than in any fourth quarter in the past decade.lastly, campbell soup (cpb) tumbled $7, or 13 percent, to $45.25 after warning that its fiscal 1999 profit is likely to fall as much as 23 cents below the street's expectations. it blamed cost-cutting moves and lower us shipments for the setback.this comes as something of a shock considering just about everyone seems to have the flu these days. come on, gang. drink your soup."}
