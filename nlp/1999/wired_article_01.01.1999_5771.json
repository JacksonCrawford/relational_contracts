(because electrons travel faster through gallium arsenide than silicon, it was ideal - despite steep costs - for supercomputers that required extremely high speed.) but when the mainframe market shrank, so did vitesse's profits. by 1993 its revenue had fallen to $26 million, a nearly 40 percent drop from 1992.about the time vitesse's profits bottomed out, the computer industry had a new problem: how to move large chunks of data quickly across a network. says lou tomasetta, vitesse's cofounder and ceo: \"within a few years everybody needed more bandwidth.\"so vitesse reengineered its gallium arsenide chips to power emerging technologies like atm, gigabit ethernet, and fiber optics. \"we took the exact same processes, equipment, and interconnect methods that intel uses for silicon and applied them to gallium arsenide,\" says tomasetta.talk about serendipity. high-speed networking technology began to take hold in the mid-1990s, right as vitesse was looking for new customers. its brag sheet now includes ericsson, alcatel, lucent, and siemens.in october 1998, vitesse reported revenues in excess of $175 million, up 67 percent from 1997. that same month it doubled its production capacity with a new $100 million chip plant in colorado springs, which will enable vitesse to expand into high-speed integrated circuits for network hubs, routers, and switches; cisco and 3com are among those who'll tap the growing supply.rivals are only just now popping up. ibm recently announced that it had devised a cheaper way to produce silicon germanium, which has properties similar to gallium arsenide but had been too costly to manufacture.vitesse's five-year jump on the market, however, means it's already spitting out low-cost chips. \"we've known for a long time that gallium arsenide could increase processor speeds,\" says tomasetta. \"now, people in silicon will kill for that extra 20 percent.\"must readode to riskimac attackclean slate?jargon watchthe life of the partyburn rate olympics: 1998's iposwho will rock 1999home depot sleeps inboffo box officejoysticking it to the academysneaking past windowshype listgirls! girls! links!face valueinside the first \"internet war\"built for speedpeoplebeen there, done thatthe bugs in your futureare you on the leper list?pandora's boom boxtomorrow todaydead-talent agencyfuture projectionsthe california spammer hammertired/wiredtips from an ex-spam kingraw data"}
