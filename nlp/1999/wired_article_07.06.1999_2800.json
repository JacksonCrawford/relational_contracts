way- - - - - -that raises the question of whether the x games are just a made-for-tv marketing vehicle that sheds a spotlight on people doing very cool things on skateboards, in-line skates, and the like. or is it time to include extreme as a member in good standing of the sports world?and what about the other half of the youth demographic? what is the enduring message for girls? more female events have been added over the five years of the x games, but even espn sends a mixed message about how seriously to take those events.saturday's crucial hour of coverage on abc \u2013 one of only two hours of network exposure for the games \u2013 opened with an exhilarating, dizzying sequence of action and graphics that featured not one single image of a female athlete. if the rest of the day's action featured females, a viewer would have missed it in the time it took to grab another beer.on sunday, abc showed friday's event, the women's aggressive in-line vert final, in which defending champion fabiola da silva, the biggest (and possibly only) star of women's extreme, finished a disappointing second.disappointing for espn and abc, that is, but not da silva herself. she still had a mob of adoring fans chanting her name, and she sounded ready to relinquish her title of queen of extreme.\"i'm kind of happy with the result,\" da silva said. \"now i can take the pressure off.\" she said she was happy for ayumi kawasaki, a 14-year-old from osaka, japan, who won the event with a package of tricks that included an upside-down 720-degree spin.\"i was the champion three times,\" da silva said. \"she wanted to win. if you want it like that, then you give some more of your power. that's how it will be for me again. rollerblading is not all about competition. i want girls to watch and participate themselves. i like helping everyone to get involved.\"two big fabiola fans from pacifica, california, screamed her name every few seconds from behind a nearby railing as she talked.\"it inspires me, because she's really good and she's a girl, so it makes you want to go out and do it,\" said autumn, 14. \"she makes it look easy. some people say the girls in the x games are here just to be models, just to show they can do it. but i think they're really good.\"even so, autumn and her friend elizabeth weren't on the pier just to see da silva, a 20-year-old from sao paulo, brazil.\"i like fabiola because she's a grrl!\" said elizabeth, also 14, raising two clenched fists for emphasis. \"but my favorite is [street and vert competitor] sven [boekhorst]. that's him right there with the white helmet. i like him because he's good and he's cute and i like his accent.\"no one is complaining about that mix of motivation, least of all espn, which wants to make sure its x games crowds provide a good backdrop for the action.as malin karlsson, working the concession booth, explained: \"i'd say it's about 50-50 here. the guys seem to get more into it. the girls don't seem as obsessed. they're here as company and to check out guys. you see a lot of thong bikinis.\"when the x games are buzzing along at their best, it's the carnival atmosphere that gets people going. people come from all over the world to participate: a finn takes on someone from france, a russian goes against a korean. it's not only the airborne tony hawk that made the event. it was the whole package.big tricks are king, which is why you can't talk or write about these games without mentioning hawk and his history-making 900 in the skateboarding competition sunday. to be sure, the snazzy graphic showing how high an athlete gets, called the huck-o-meter, is a lot more fun when the athletes are male \u2013 because they get higher.\"unfortunately, in every sport it's almost always like that. the girls get a bum rap, which really sucks,\" said in-line skater shane yost of melbourne, australia. \"their level has really improved. they're starting to get the recognition, but not as much as they deserve.\"yost said the difference in male and female style on the half-pipe was not so much about strength or speed.\"i guess you could put it down to testosterone. some of the tricks you do require a little aggression. without that, you won't be able to put the line together.\"then again, who among the audience can expect to put lines together like the top competitors?\"i'm just here for the bands, the skating, and the free stuff,\" said tyler, 19. \"the guys are better than the girls, yeah. but the girls are better than i am.\" 2.jun.98"}
