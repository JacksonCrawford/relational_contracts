- - - -workers are building a snow-covered mountain, a hilly dirt-bike course, mock rock faces for the climbers, and a simulated city for skateboarders to abuse, all constructed along san francisco's waterfront.the work crews are led by icons such as tim payne, a laid-back, sunburned guy with ragged, shoulder-length blond hair. payne is a skate-ramp builder to the gods, readying an altar where 30,000 fans will come to worship.payne has spent the last several weeks constructing the series of ramps, stairways, and railings that make up the street course, which will host four of the x games' 23 events: men's street skateboarding, men's and women's in-line skating, and men's bicycle stunt riding.the builder has become a grand master of ramp construction, fully versed in the way slope and surface combine to give skateboarders the \"perfect ride.\" espn gave him only one rule for constructing the course: the judges have to be able to see every jump.this is payne's first year constructing the whole street course, and he says he's tried to make it as realistic as possible, using objects such as fiberglass picnic tables for the skateboarders to do tricks on.all told, the course cost nearly us$40,000 and is constructed of 5 to 6 miles of 2-by-6-inch boards, payne said. the boards are spaced 8 inches apart and covered with two layers of half-inch plywood.the top layer of the ramps is the latest in skatability: a plastic-based compound called skatelite. skateboarders first used the compound in 1996 and it has become the surface of choice for x athletes. skatelite is the showoff little brother of richlite, a product developed more than 60 years ago by combining wood chips and plastic to create a smooth, solid, resilient sheet.richlite was used in boats, countertops, and, most famously, in those white plastic cutting boards that have drawn heat for being a bacterial risk.but as much as bacteria might like the surface, the skateboarders love it more. it doesn't rot like wood and it doesn't get slick in inclement weather, like plastic.at the edge of the street course, a construction crew of 35 is raising a massive structure \u2013 110 feet tall and 300 feet long \u2013 that supports a load of 40 pounds per square inch.designed by dan bouge of aluma systems, this mass of scaffolding and plywood will be covered with chipped ice for the snowboarding event.the structure is so huge that the port authority of san francisco temporarily halted construction, afraid that the pier would collapse under the proposed weight, said bill yaeger, the site foreman for aluma.bouge redesigned the mountain to spread the load over a bigger area of the pier.this is the third year that espn has attempted to bring a mountain to the x games instead of bringing the x games to the mountains. in 1997 in san diego, bouge designed the first structure. the timber-framed predecessor to today's slope didn't perform as well as expected, and in 1998 the aluma crew built the snowboard mountain out of modular metal scaffolding. the same design was used for this year's games.as soon as the event is over, the crew, which spent two weeks of 12-hour days creating the monolithic construction, will rip it down again.\"it's amazing for a two-day event,\" sighs bouge. as the snowboarding mountain started to rise up from the pier, some might have noticed growths appearing on its south side. these are the climbing walls, painted in day-glo colors, which will be used for the sportclimbing and bouldering events. sportclimbing is a speed competition, and bouldering challenges athletes' technical ability.steel frames covered with three-quarter-inch plywood make up the climbing walls. a master \"route setter\" oversees the project, determining the intervals at which synthetic handholds will be attached.at the water's edge is the dirt-bike course. built by the famous crew of hoffman bikes, the dirt-bike lanes consist of three rows of 8-foot-high jumps at various pitches.the jumps are shaped by styrofoam forms, or billets, buried under the dirt; they're configured to give riders maximum air as they careen over them.hoffman's steve swope, who is overseeing the construction, used 50 truckloads of dirt in the course. \"we hand-pack every jump,\" he said. \"it's kind of like doing pottery.\"all dirt-bike riders themselves, the members of swopes' crew must practice self-restraint and keep off the course (except for a few test runs) until the competitors have had their chance. any contact will disrupt the perfection of the jumps, which are covered with tarps to prevent the sun from drying them out.payne, swopes, and their contemporaries might be the newly anointed heroes of extreme sports, but payne says he owes his craft to one man: the original x athlete, king of danger, madman extraordinaire, evel knievel. 3.nov.97"}
