that's the thrust of the republican national committee's new web portal, gopnet.com. it claims to be the first political party-sponsored portal and isp that -- in a strange marriage of e-commerce and politics -- allows users to check on their stocks, buy christmas gifts, send flowers, and contribute to the republican party.\"we have a different mission than your normal community isp,\" rnc deputy chief of staff larry purpuro said. \"it is our effort to maximize web power for our fundraising community and organizing.\"the elephantine site, announced tuesday, is the stuff of conservative web surfing dreams, replete with gop news, links to state and local parties, and of course, the gop gift shop.naturally, rival democrats responded with disdain at the gop hoo-ha. not only were they first with a portal -- way back in the dark web ages of 1996 -- the democrats insist that money-making is not the primary goal of its online enterprise, unlike the republicans.then again, big business is the republican way.for a monthly fee of us$19.95, users receive internet service, email, and access to chat room and message boards, as well as gop perks like a calendar of republican events, legislative alerts, and direct links to such groups as the young republicans.the new portal marks a dramatic shift from the conventional party outreach methods, such as door-to-door canvassing and direct mailings, and demonstrates how integral the net has become to modern political life, and how potentially effective it can be to a political party.the rnc has no qualms about its plans to support its new effort by selling advertising banners off the site. \"this is absolutely a business and we want to be sure we can expand the content and subscriber base. and to do that it has to have some level of sustainable revenue,\" purpuro said.with that, rnc officials are hoping to lure roughly about 50,000 subscribers who have similar goals in mind: a daily dose of republican-oriented news and information.\"it is a concept of wiring into a secure network of 50 state parties and hundreds of thousands of republican activists,\" purpuro said. \"and we think we can give republicans unfiltered rich news and information about the party and the process.\"unfiltered? well, not exactly.the site will be equipped with the latest in adult-content filtering technology, to keep the naughty bits off the message boards. that's because part of the portal's appeal will be that it is family-friendly. \"this service is for politically interested and active folks, not for every online user,\" purpuro said.while the mixture of e-commerce and party affiliation might strike some as tasteless, some insiders say the party's entry into the portal arena is long overdue.\"politics is all about marketing, it's all about getting a message out to people,\" said tony paquin, ceo of netivation.com, a developer of online political communities. \"that is the driving factor. the net lets you get your message out inexpensively and you can raise money on it. it's a double hit.\"as it is, the net is already rich with web sites that feature different ways to disseminate political information, such as candidate debates on dnet and 90-second video clips on up-and-comers like freedomchannel.com. exgov.com, a web site founded by former republican vice presidential candidate jack kemp, serves as an internet portal providing direct links to federal, state, and local governments.\"it's like in the last 90 days a switch has flipped and suddenly everybody wants to be on the web,\" said paquin, whose company hosted more than 100 political web sites for nearly every candidate in virginia's recent election.the democratic national committee also has big plans to get in on the political web scene, with an upcoming \"e-party\" initiative that will also include a portal. though the site is not yet ready to launch, party officials said democrats -- not republicans -- were actually the first party to use the net for political organizing with a 1996 portal called ballot.net.\"we started ahead, so we don\u2019t have very far to go,\" said dnc deputy press secretary rick hess.\"the republicans are the first to sell isp accounts,\" hess admitted.but \"we focus on issues, organizing politically, creating online communities of activists. the difference is stressing organizing on one side and money-raising on the other.... the republicans have chosen to use the net to raise money.\"that's not to say that the democratic party won't at some point use its future web portal to raise funds. after all, it is the cheapest place on earth to put political information out and bring money in, paquin said.\"politicians are looking for new ways to raise money,\" he said. \"to send a letter to every voter in a district could cost you about $100,000. but you can put a nice web site up for $1,000.\""}
