pioneer iridium llc and ico global communications -- declared bankruptcy in august. a third, globalstar telecommunications, remains afloat but has yet to see whether a decent market exists for satellite phone service, which lets users place calls from anywhere on earth but costs more than standard mobile phone calls.thus, it was somewhat puzzling when mccaw, the trailblazing executive behind successful telecommunications properties like nextel communications, nextlink, and at&t-owned mccaw cellular, announced his plan to salvage ico\u2019s failing satellite venture.on monday, mccaw unveiled an agreement to a group of investors prepared to spend up to us$1.2 billion to resurrect ico, which filed for protection from creditors after failing to secure funding from key investors. ico, founded in 1995, was planning a satelite network for sending voice, data, and faxes.while revealing little about his strategy behind the ico investment mccaw said he planned to \"bring the company back to good health\" and to launch its mobile satellite service by mid-2001.the investment wasn't a surprise to industry analysts. officials at teledesic, the satellite data communications firm mccaw founded in 1990, disclosed weeks ago they were considering whether to invest in ico or iridium.of course, the risky move didn't fully answer the question why mccaw would want to get into an industry just when everyone else seems to be bailing out.o. casey corr, author of an upcoming biography of the telecom mogul, says the move is typical of mccaw.\"craig is a master at finding value in the wreckage of other people's failure of nerve or business strategy,\" corr said. \"if you look at craig's early days in cellular, a lot of dreams crashed and burned because of an inability to manage the risk or face the frightening prospect of doing battle with the baby bells.\"mccaw's investment in the satellite phone industry doesn't seem too different from the time mccaw got involved in nextel communications, a near-bankrupt wireless service provider that has since staged a remarkable comeback, corr said.but mccaw may have more at stake in orchestrating a turnaround of ico. making a success out of a satellite voice venture could do a lot to improve credibilitly and investor interest in teledesic, a far more ambitious venture.\"as long as there are ventures out there like iridium and ico that are perceived to have failed, it's going to be hard to get the investing public interested in investing in projects like teledesic,\" said marco caceres, senior space analyst with the teal group.bellevue, washington-based teledesic plans to build a us$9 billion, high-speed internet-in-the-sky network by 2004. the privately held company has so far raised $1.5 billion in financing to date, backed by microsoft chairman bill gates, boeing, and motorola as well as mccaw.industry analysts are concerned that the costly data system might be obsolete by 2004, with current land-based wireless networks rapidly expanding and improving. the company also faces competiton from satellite ventures like astrolink, which is also building a network for delivering high-speed internet service.even with mccaw's track record, turning ico around is anything but a sure bet.iridium, the only company so far that has tested the global commercial market for satellite phone service -- has been a spectacular failure. by the time the company managed to put up its costly satellite network, its target market of travelling business executives were already accustomed to sophisticated cell phone technology.it's also uncertain how ico's technology could help teledesic, which is participating in the investment along with mccaw's other investment afficiate, eagle river.caceres said it seems unlikely that ico could be transformed at this stage into from to a data network. however, he said it's possible for teledesic to use some of ico's satellite and technology to improve or cut costs of building its planned network.william kidd, satellite analyst for c. e. unterberg towbin, said it seemed unlikely that ico's satellites could be used for anything but low-speed data services.\"with respect to the possibility of modifying ico's satellites for broadband, we continue to doubt the technical possibility of that concept, given that ico satellites were designed exclusively for voice,\" kidd said in a report issued monday.nevertheless, analysts saw the mccaw-led investment as a sign that consolidation is likely to continue in the satellite telecommunications industry, as players aim to cut competition and shave the costs of building their muti-billion dollar networks.it could also be a sign that the industry is in for a major shakeup.\"craig mccaw has a motto: flexibility is king,\" corr said. \"he'll do whatever it takes.\""}
