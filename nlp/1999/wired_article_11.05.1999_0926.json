people with similar interests could be brought together at a business conference.- - -no escape: about a third of all americans now have cell phones and there are new users signing up at the rate of every two seconds -- a year-on-year growth rate of 25 percent -- according to ctia, the wireless industry's trade organization.if you buy the their forecasts, wireless use will explode in the next three years as the nation's mobile networks migrate to the third generation communication standards, which will be capable of wirelessly moving data at broadband speeds.the ctia believes that when handheld computers and smart phones move to the faster standards they will eclipse pcs as the computing platform of the masses. \"this is the event that will be looked back on as the year wireless data exploded,\" said tom wheeler, president and ceo of ctia.- - -commence with commerce: within a year, almost all wireless phones will feature some kind of net browser or information service, predicted peter allen, vice president of marketing at saraide, which is developing services for mobile devices.however, allen said the current practice of repurposing web content for smart phones and handhelds via technologies like the wap (wireless access protocol) or palm computing's web clipping won't ultimately be very successful.instead of simply dumping web content into a \"horsepower-challenged\" device and expecting it to fly, the mobile has to be treated like a thin client that relies on a server to perform most of the computing, allen said.with that in mind, saraide and handset manufacturer neopoint are developing services that put a lot of the intelligence on the server.neopoint previewed myalladin, services for wireless carriers, who in turn will offer them to subscribers. as well as offering pda-like capabilities such as email, calendaring, and contacts, myalladin will feature a range of gps-powered location services like intelligent white and yellow pages that know where you are and act accordingly.the company demonstrated the ability to get local traffic reports and driving directions without having to enter a starting address. a movie service tells users what's on and when at local theaters, offering ticket purchase information and driving directions to the theater with the touch of a single button.\"say you're a garth brooks fan. you want to be alerted the minute he comes to town and you want to be able to buy tickets immediately. you can do that,\" said kevin thornton, neopoint's vice president and general manager.- - -free the airwaves: jeff hawkins, who fathered the palm pilot that helped launch the handheld craze, also predicted massive growth for wireless computing devices but only if wireless networks become something they currently are not -- dirt cheap and always on.\"over the next few years we're going to see these kind of things become really, really popular,\" he said, brandishing a handheld. \"[but] for the great user experience you need a consistent connection.... we have to get to wireless data access that is essentially free.... we have to be connected all the time at no cost.\"hawkins, the co-founder of palm computing and now chief product officer at handspring, which makes the visor, said e-commerce will be huge, the killer app of wireless computing.\"more people will be accessing the internet through these things than any other kind of device, and they will be doing e-commerce.\"hawkins recalled the first time he bought a cd from amazon using a palm vii.\"it was really quite an amazing experience to do that,\" he said. \"if you can do that with something in your pocket, why wait until you get home to your pc?\"i know where you were last summer: ctia's wheeler pointed out the downside of the federal legislation requiring mobile phones to be able to tell 911 operators the location of the caller.\"the fbi wants to turn phones into a locator device,\" he said. \"but when your phone becomes a locater beacon, i have problems with that.\"\"it's ok for your location to be disclosed when you ask for directions or phone 911, because you are giving your permission. but i'm not sure a parent should have the right to monitor their kids, or a wife to monitor her husband.\"this ability has been exploited with great success in japan, where parents are using phones' tracking capabilities to keep tabs on their kids by following the phone's movements through a web site.what's next, adding breathalyzers to the phones?"}
