one with a degree in physics, instead of art. bill amend was already making modem jokes in 1985 when he was still trying to break into the comics business, with his strip foxtrot. fourteen years later, he can poke fun at the imac (\"hi, i'm ifruit. hug me\" says the computer. \"ithink iwill bsick\" responds a character) and people will get the joke.\"it's more a function of the general culture catching up to my own technical interests,\" said amend. \" i feel more comfortable writing about them now. i don't want to write a strip that 95 percent of the readership doesn't get. now that grandmothers and school children are getting wired, it makes it a lot easier to let jason strut his stuff.\"foxtrot  made its debut in 1988 after several years of efforts and now appears in more than 1,000 newspapers nationwide. the fox family consists of bumbling roger, a corporate drone, his wife andy (only her mother calls her \"andrea\"), a newspaper columnist who works at home, 16-year-old peter and his bottomless stomach, 14-year-old boy-happy shopaholic paige, and 10-year-old evil genius jason.amend drew political cartoons while he was attending amherst college. he'd wanted to study film but ended up majoring in physics. not knowing what to do with himself after graduation, he decided to give full-time cartooning a shot.his first strip, bango ridge, was rejected by every publisher ad syndicate, but the los angeles times encouraged him to try another strip, which became foxtrot. it took two-and-a-half years of rejections and rewrites before he signed a deal with universal press syndicate. the whole process is documented on the foxtrot web site.influenced by strips like bloom county and calvin & hobbes, amend set out to create a contemporary comic strip.\"i looked at the funny pages, and most of the family strips that were out there seemed to be very safe, very tame, and almost rooted in a bygone era,\" he said. \"there didn't seem to be anything at the time that i connected with as a young adult in america. my sense of family life was that there was a lot more chaos and politics and silliness and fewer trips to the golf course and running into the mailman.\"amend said he's been pleasantly surprised with how many young fans he's drawn.\"when i started the strip i was in my mid-20s, writing it largely for myself, and i assumed my readership would be college-educated people with a somewhat nerdy bent,\" he said. \"but i would have to say the most passionate fans seem to be 12-year-old kids. i ask myself how could they possibly get these jokes? but they seem to, and i like the fact that there seem to be some smart kids out there.\"jason is the star of the strip, an unabashed genius in a time where many cartoon heroes \u2013 bart simpson, beavis and butthead, eric cartman \u2013 are as dumb as garden vegetables. jason prays for homework and hard tests and freaks out if he \"only\" gets an a++ on a test. \"he's a genius but also nicely na\u00efve,\" said amend. \"so he's not quite ready to take over the world. he tends to be his own worst enemy at times.\"he also has his first job, as a spokesman for math software. wolfram research, maker of mathematica, chose jason as the \"spokesman\" for calculus wiz, which is targeted at high school and college students.foxtrot's popularity with the younger crowd was why wolfram went with jason. \"it was probably the most appropriate cartoon figure that had something to do with technology and math and science, and he has a kind of a subversive, do-your-own-thing attitude,\" said john bonadies, director of sales and marketing for the champaigne, illinois, company.a little competitive nudging brought about by dilbert's success motivated amend's efforts to add computer jokes and also to build up the foxtrot web site. universal new media, the internet arm of his syndicate, recently gave the site a huge overhaul, which amend thinks will help bring in new fans.\"there's a huge potential readership out there, particularly in the younger age groups, that for various reasons are not reading newspapers but they are on the internet,\" he said.rather than set up foxtrot.com as an outlet for the strip and to peddle merchandise, amend and universal set it up as a \"mini-portal.\" there are links that each of the foxtrot characters would like. peter and roger point to sports links, paige to fashion links, and jason to science sites. even quincy, jason's pet iguana, has links, like an iguana cam and a godzilla web site. and there are message boards and a chat room.the plan is to expand into other areas, based on the interests of each character. right now, foxtrot.com has an agreement with amazon.com and offers a jason store, which links to books jason would like. eventually that will expand to video games, clothing, and other items.\"we're expanding the role beyond public relations and minimal e-commerce and trying to build on the personality of the strip,\" said amend. \"my sense is many of the people visiting the site are young enough that they relate to the interests of the characters. a web link to a star wars fan site that jason would find interesting would also be of interest to a foxtrot fan.\""}
