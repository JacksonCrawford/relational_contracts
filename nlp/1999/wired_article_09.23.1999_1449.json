- - - -the stakes are high. with office installed on 100 million personal computers, sun is taking on microsoft's most important application, accounting for 40 percent of total revenue.microsoft downplays the threat of the free software.\"star office has been around for years,\" said microsoft office product manager george meng. \"they've been giving it away and we've sold 100 million licenses. i think that speaks for itself.\"but meng said microsoft is busy on a new internet-based, or \"web-hosted\" office version, not in response to star but because customers are looking for it. meng said there are not big technical obstacles to creating the product, although it may involve partnering with other companies.\"we will have a web-hosted office,\" said steve ballmer, president of microsoft has said repeatedly in recent appearances. the new product won't be free like star, microsoft insiders say, but the company admits it is examining different pricing models.for its part, sun believes it can make serious inroads into microsoft's office market. it has already put thousands of copies into users hands via downloads over the internet, and it's preparing star portal, which makes it a fully web-hosted application.while the star office software lacks the features of office, it's getting passing marks from reviewers, who see it as acceptable for all but \"power users.\" indeed, one of the key worries and sources of debate in the marketplace is whether it can fully share documents from microsoft office, a sign that potential users may be viewing it as an alternative.\"there is an opportunity for someone to displace microsoft,\" said rob enderle of giga information systems, an industry consultant. \"i would argue that it (the threat) is as strong as when ibm went into its decline. microsoft is dealing with one of the highest levels of customer dissatisfaction of any company that we follow.\"microsoft users have come to view office upgrades as \"a tax,\" that users need to pay, and \"the (perceived) value has gotten disconnected from the revenue.\"no one would suggest that microsoft is playing a shell game. each of the upgrades has been an awesome technical feat, involving tens of millions of lines of code and putting highly sophisticated automation features on every desktop.indeed, it's the sophistication that could be microsoft's achilles heel.\"for 99 percent of users, star will have everything they need,\" said andrew bochman of aberdeen group. \"the average person is not a power user of all those microsoft features. it's hard to see how microsoft can respond to this threat.\"some are skeptical that sun will be able to ever come close to matching microsoft's consumer marketing ability, as well as its skills in packaging software and training users, and in building a huge brand identity worldwide.still, the internet helps all upstarts, including well-heeled ones like sun, the dominant player in the computer server market, selling most of the machines that house web pages and serve them to millions of users.the internet is growing, as is the use of \"hosted\" applications, software that runs on the web. scores of new companies, called application service providers, are helping build the infrastructure to put many companies on the internet. as they install companies' internet systems, some will install office suites, and some will tout the merits of the free star system.a company called desktop.com this week will release a web-based desktop and software system that's aimed at taking on microsoft's operating system. in effect, it \"would duplicate the look, feel, and functionality of a windows-based system -- without the hassle of owning and maintaining software on a desktop,\" said christine nairne, e+offering analyst, who released a brokerage report forecasting a surge in such applications.\"the idea behind these initiatives remains the same, to make applications more accessible, and more functional, to more users, at a lower cost,\" said e+offering analyst christine nairne.a consumer product company's help desk or a ticket ordering system, for example, with hundreds of users who might normally install office at every workstation might go for a pared-down suite. star might fit the bill, so microsoft knows it needs to be there as well.\"there is demand (for a web-hosted office),\" said weng. \"we know it. we hear it from our customers. we were working on this before sun bought star,\" said weng.the company will talk more about its internet strategy at an all-day conference for the press in redmond thursday. while office is not on the agenda, it's expecting to field questions about it. weng said the company is well-along in its strategic effort to make office a web product.\"microsoft is beginning to react to the emergence of asps -- acknowledging that the traditional model is changing,\" said nairne. \"and they need to be prepared to play in the asp space.\"copyright"}
