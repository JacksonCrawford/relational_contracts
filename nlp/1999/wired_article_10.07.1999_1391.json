consumers and developers at internet world and is threatening to steal the limelight from palm and windows ce devices.handspring\ufffds large booth has been swamped with anxious onlookers, and ringed by more than 20 companies displaying a range of add-on products. developers love working with the company, and fans, intrigued by its flexibility, are leaving the palm fold.\"the palm is pretty good, but it is too expensive for the average person,\" said marsha russell, a consultant who was eager to try out the visor. standing at the edge of the handspring booth, she whipped out her palmpilot and compared it to an orange-colored visor.\"this is thinner, and you can upgrade and get more memory without having to open it,\" she said. \"the software is easily transferable. the expansion slot is the thing, plus, it\ufffds a nice funky color.\"\"visor is going to kick ass,\" said dan royea of deeptec, a small company working with design company revolv to develop cradles and different mounting devices that add features and recharge the visor. \"it will put windows ce out of business.\"royea said microsoft has tried to be competitive with the palm, but since palm just dropped its prices -- to stay competitive with the much lower priced visor -- ce-based products will be hard pressed to keep up. plus he said, \"it takes more power and guts to support ce.\"palm, which decided not to exhibit at internet world, seems to be standing still or even losing ground in many eyes. developers said the palm will remain a sexy status symbol for executives, but that visor could attract a mass audience.the creators of the palmpilot, jeff hawkins and donna dubinsky, started handspring last year and immediately licensed the palm os.the visor is not only less expensive than a palmpilot (the lowest priced model is available for us$149), it\ufffds touted as being faster, too. it can sync to pcs faster using a universal serial bus and can use all of the programs designed for the palm.dayakar puskoor, ceo of the software firm jp systems, said the visor turns a handheld into a real computing device and not just an organizer.\"that\ufffds where the big excitement is. i don\ufffdt think the palm will go away, but this is the first big competition.\"the visor\ufffds unique springboard feature is also being billed as the first truly plug-and-play device for adding features to a mobile device. there\ufffds no software to add, and whatever device is slipped in the back slot immediately appears as activated on the visor\ufffds screen.\"it\ufffds a significantly faster connection,\" said steve sabram of datastick. \"with this, it\ufffds like dropping a pc card right into the bus. it\ufffds a heck of a lot faster.\"one of the most popular visor add-ons being shown at internet world uses the emerging bluetooth radio frequency standard for wireless transactions. with blue connect, produced by widcom, people can send wireless email messages or access internet and corporate email accounts between a visor and a bluetooth-enabled cell phone or pc.marcosoft, a company with italian founders, has created a module that adds global positioning system and mapping software to the visor. the company said the visor version slips in faster and has more features than the palm.other products available or under development: a heart-rate monitor, a rioport player for mp3 files, pagers, voice recorders, and modules that will carry the equivalent of 10 to 15 books.a module that will turn the visor into a cell phone, as well as a wireless modem module, is expected to be available next year, possibly as early as the first quarter.developers are embracing handspring because of the simplicity in engineering accessories for the springboard slot, and because the company goes out of its way for partners.tino frigino, marcosoft vice president of sales and marketing, said the springboard slot \"gave additional ammunition to clever people and everybody developed special devices.... it\ufffds as simple as that. a lot of the people and the applications are the same, but it opens an entire new capability. that\ufffds the beauty of this idea.\"hundreds of people have downloaded the handsprings free developers kit, said director of product marketing rob haitani.many companies currently developing for the visor platform originally started developing products for palm and view handspring\ufffds management style as visionary.enthusiasm from developers such as deeptec's royea, who was impressed by handspring's cooperation, could lead to more third party products, and eventually more market share.\"jeff hawkins spent 45 minutes talking to us this morning, royea said. it was cool.\"\"the amount of bureaucracy we had to go through with palm was incredible,\" said datastick's sabram.\"i\ufffdve been involved in lots of third-party development before, but this is the most open and facilitating group i\ufffdve ever worked with to get products out the door. we had direct ceo access. it\ufffds an incredible opportunity.\""}
