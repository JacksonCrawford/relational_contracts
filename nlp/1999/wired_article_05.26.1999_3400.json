"montreal -- a rarely invoked canadian law may send an ontario man to jail for shooting his mouth off in cyberspace. gregory barrett was arraigned in guelph, ontario, late last week on criminal libel charges stemming from an online campaign he has waged against a toronto-area dog breeder since 1994. barrett finally removed the materials from his central america-based web site on wednesday.\"it's mental torture,\" said darla lofranco, a breeder of rare hungarian kuvasz herding dogs and the target of barrett's wrath.\"i'm probably the top breeding kuvasz kennel in the world, but if barrett had kept this up much longer, i would have been finished.\"on his web site, barrett accused lofranco of \"depraved\" practices, business irregularities, and lax animal care. among other things, barrett claimed that a dog he had purchased from lofranco in 1993 suffered from crippling hip dysplasia and had to be put down.barrett did not return phone calls.lofranco flatly denies barrett's allegations, but after five years of defending her reputation to prospective clients and competitors, she said she finally lost her patience. she printed out the offending web page and in march took them to the provincial courthouse in guelph, requesting that criminal charges be filed.under canadian criminal law, in addition to civil actions, a libel defendant may face criminal prosecution, which carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.lofranco said she rejected the idea of pursuing a civil action because she didn't believe she would collect damages. barrett sued her over the hip-dysplasia incident and lost three times, but she was unable to collect legal fees from those suits.besides, she said, the dispute has lasted long enough.\"the impact has been unbelievable,\" she said. \"my competitors have jumped on it, and barrett's allegations are often the first thing that buyers knows about me.\"a law professor at the university of ottawa said that the statute in question is rarely used, but was only recently upheld by the supreme court of canada.\"the court said the law was necessary for just this kind of case, where the complainant can't seek redress through civil law,\" said michael geist, who specializes in internet law.while there have been numerous civil libel actions over internet content in canada and elsewhere, geist said that there have been very few criminal libel cases.\"the internet provides the opportunity to respond directly to the person you believe is defaming you, so it usually doesn't escalate to this point,\" geist said.lofranco concedes that she never took advantage of that opportunity. aside from lawyers' letters and one email from barrett in which he said he would delete the offending material from his site if she agreed to withdraw the complaint, the breeder has had no direct contact with her alleged defamer.\"i was frightened and embarrassed by all the things he was saying,\" she says. \"i didn't particularly want to talk to him.\"fearing litigation, barrett's original web host, magma communications of nepean, ontario, yanked his site in february -- but he soon relocated it to a server in el salvador.though barrett finally removed the offending material from the web on wednesday morning, geist says that the case shows that existing canadian laws can work in virtual space.\"this case merely illustrates that we have to apply existing laws even if an act occurs online. the crown has a responsibility to bring charges where they are warranted, and they appear to be warranted.\"geist added that canadian courts have dealt with crimes that are viewed as being committed outside of canada, but have asserted jurisdiction where a portion of the act occurred in canada or was closely tied to canada.even information freedom advocates like jim carroll, author of the canadian internet handbook, agree.\"the thing here is that we have enough laws,\" carroll said. \"the fact is that the net doesn't need or deserve special treatment. if it's libel, then it's libel no matter where it's published. people have to get the idea out of their heads that the net is a free-flowing anarchist paradise.\"related wired
