your own folder!elsewhere, it can't resist another dig: \"a note in albert's locker to reporters: if you want an interview, check my web site.\"the only surprise about belle and his web site, which espn quoted from the week before last, is that more athletes haven't done this sooner. any veteran sports reporter can tell you that, no matter what the question, athletes give whatever answer they want. belle's through-the-web proclamations take that approach and run with it.ross schaufelberger, president of los angeles-based athlete direct, hopes no one gets the wrong idea about belle's site.\"by no means do we want to come across as encouraging albert not to talk to the media,\" schaufelberger said. \"that's his own decision.\"athlete direct has sites for more than 120 athletes, including sensation-of-the-moment mia hamm, star of the us women's world cup team.\"we're not saying it's the wave of the future that athletes won't talk to the media,\" schaufelberger said. \"but what we are saying is that athletes are going to be able to develop more effective web sites. it's not widespread yet, but i think growth in the next year or so will be pretty dramatic. we're encouraging the athletes to do more and more with their web sites. we think they can set this up as a significant revenue stream for them.\"belle remains the highest-profile example of that. besides his once-a-week journal entries, belle also offers -- no joke -- financial advice. even the wall street journal had to take notice of what the site calls \"financial advice from albert ... the money player!\"\"albert and his brother terry provided us with a lot of ideas for the site, like the financial advice and the crossword puzzles,\" schaufelberger said. still, access to belle's thoughts about baseball are the heart of the site. schaufelberger said all athletes he has signed have agreed to provide new content at least once a week, and belle offers his thoughts more often if the urge strikes. athletes receive up to half the revenue a site generates through links to sales of books and memorabilia and so forth.\"ok, it's time to set the record straight,\" reads belle's current posting. \"in my last at-bat on sunday against philadelphia i hit a ball down the third baseline and i started running for first. it went foul, so i stopped running. as i was making my way back to the batter's box, the third-base umpire called it fair and i started running back. that's all there is to it. but now, some people are claiming i don't hustle, and i don't agree with that. when i slide into the fences trying get balls, there's no mention of that in the papers. i try and score on every possible base hit if i can, and no one says a word. i wouldn't have been around for this long if i didn't hustle and play hard....\"dave sheinin, who covers the orioles for the washington post, handled the lack of real belle quotes this way last weekend:\"belle has remained silent during his struggles at the plate, but on his web site he explains, '[s]ooner or later when the guys around me are hitting more, i'm going to start getting pitches and i'll start hitting the ball more, all of which will lead to more wins for the o's.'\"this despite the fact that, as sheinen and espn both noted, b.j. surhoff and harold baines, batting before and after belle, had both been hitting very well indeed.so far, the message board contains more than 200 postings, but only one in the special folder in which sports reporters are encouraged to ask questions.\"we created a special message board for reporters,\" schaufelberger said. \"that came from espn when they suggested he might answer some questions from the media at the site. we have a sense of humor about it. we understand the media is going to look at this in a variety of ways. we look at this as a way for albert to communicate directly with his fans, and to come across in an unfiltered way.\"which raises the question: when are superstar pop stars, best-selling authors, geek computer tycoons, and often-burned, pants-dropping presidents going to get in on the action?"}
