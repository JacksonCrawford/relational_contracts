issuing copyrights; and processing transactions, royalty streams, and the interaction between distributors and retailers. while both companies have deals with intertrust, reciprocal has also allied with microsoft, adobe, xerox, and softbank to manage transactions.larry miller, president of reciprocal music, said the first financial transactions using reciprocal's clearinghouse services will occur in the next month, using microsoft's windows media format. although it will be milestone, the next year for reciprocal and other sdmi companies looms as one big beta period, as systems are put to the test and consumers pick the winners.\"at the end of the day, hopefully it [sdmi] would be very seamless, but i would hazard a guess over the next 12 months, as new technologies and business models evolve, that this period of experimentation will continue to happen until the very successful business models will be uncovered,\" said duncan shaw, chief business development officer at reciprocal. \"i think it's going to be a little confusing for a little while just yet.\"the danger for the record industry and sdmi, of course, is that if the market splinters in too many directions, consumers may get frustrated and look for an easy answer in mp3. already there are at least four different codecs used to format digital music: microsoft's windows media format (wma), mp3, the advanced audio coding (aac), and lucent's perceptual audio coder (epac). to further complicate matters, companies like liquid audio and mjuice have built their own comprehensive systems for secure music distribution.chris smith, the portable audio program manager at creative labs, attends the sdmi meetings and is preparing to launch one of the first sdmi portable players in the nomad ii.\"it's not going to be that good of a user experience if creative and diamond and thomson and matsushita all choose different drms and different codecs to implement,\" said smith, who expects to see about a half dozen portable players in the next few months that are sdmi-compliant. \"and it's not going to be a good experience if universal, warner, sony, emi, and bmg all decide on different drm systems and codecs and file formats. it will be bedlam.\"intertrust and microsoft are the two major companies creating technology to distribute music files securely over the net, and the success of the sdmi initiative is largely in their hands.intertrust's digital rights management system is used to secure and track all types of intellectual property, such as music, video, and text as it's distributed over the net. the company's digibox containers determine if a user, for example, may be able to listen to a music file three times but not four, or pass it on to two friends but not three.microsoft's recently announced windows media device manager will perform a similar function, and allows other software and hardware developers to hook into the system. microsoft demonstrated its drm system this week on a prototype of the next-generation diamond rio player, and announced promotional deals with emi and bmg.even if companies like intertrust and microsoft succeed in creating an easy-to-use distribution system, there is the ever-present danger of crackers, who have already found workarounds for microsoft's media format, and busted through dvd movie encryption, which was five years in the making.as the record industry begins to evaluate the different drm systems and other technologies over the next year, there is a strong possibility that each label will choose different systems to distribute its content.\"you may think that the record companies are a united front, but that's not true, because they are in competition among themselves,\" said chiariglione.\"so the first record company that understands the right way to do business out of this specification is going to have an advantage over its competitors.\""}
