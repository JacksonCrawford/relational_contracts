shop owners, who are getting the short end of the dot-com stick.", "author": "reuters", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "10.26.1999 08:00 AM", "text": "when everyone wants to be a millionaire, it can be hard to find people to work for minimum wage. it is a trend seen throughout much of the us as the country basks in a robust economy that has pushed unemployment below 5 percent. but perhaps nowhere is it more pronounced than in silicon valley where even receptionists can make millions in stock options if they get in on the right ground floor.here, many of the students that have traditionally filled openings in bagel stores and pizza places are too busy trying to start their own internet business to be distracted by a part-time job, or they are just too wealthy to need it.a large home depot store that recently opened in east palo alto had such difficulty filling its sales positions that it almost took the unusual step of advertising the jobs in movie theaters, along with all the previews of coming attractions.\"it's been a challenge,\" says dana johnson, an assistant manager of the store. \"when unemployment is 2.3 percent, it's tough to find employable people. you get a lot of people who have no skills at all, or have criminal backgrounds or just don't want to work.\"home depot has more to offer than many of the other local employers. with salaries in its new store averaging $19 an hour, full-time sales people can earn close to $40,000 a year. \"it's not all that much here on the peninsula, where you can't buy a shack for under half a million dollars,\" johnson is quick to point out.still, other retail stores that pay half that or less are facing an even more severe labor crunch. \"the labor shortage is very very real,\" says cornelia pendleton, who manages an arts supply store in palo alto and also chairs a downtown marketing group for local merchants.\"i have been with this group for six years, and i would say this has definitely been one of the worst times. i hear a lot of merchants ask if i know of anybody who could work for them. they are calling high schools to try to find people.\"help wanted signs decorate most store and restaurant windows in palo alto and local newspapers run page after page of help wanted ads in the classifieds section. to read some of the ads, it appears many of the local service businesses are limping along with skeleton crews. one four-star hotel recently posted an ad listing jobs in all of the following areas: guest service agent, operator, bell/door attendant, reservation agent, maintenance/painter, room service operator, room service server, restaurant server, busser host/hostess, house person, and room attendant.local department stores say they are seeking full time and part time staff for regular and holiday positions in all departments.and some residents say they are beginning to notice the lack of services. one exasperated transplant from orange county in southern california describes excessively long lines and service snafus as the norm every time she goes to run errands. when she went to a car wash recently, she had to go through the trash to retrieve a stack of maps and a book the attendants had mistakenly thrown away. when a friend came to visit and tried checking into a hotel (the same one with all the job vacancies), she was erroneously given the keys to the honeymoon suite, where another couple had already checked in. fortunately they were not in the room at the time.\"you just see the looks on the customers faces. it's like, 'is there anybody here that can help?'\" says pendleton, who works in the back office at the art supply store, but is always having to help out on the floor. \"it's worrisome.\"of course, more troubling than such minor inconveniences is the unemployable segment of the population. some advocates for the area's poor say that even in this economy there are people who lack basic skills needed to get even the most low-level clerical jobs, which often require a familiarity with computers.\"we do have a lot of people who can not find work and have a hard time getting the training they need because it is too expensive,\" says armando arroyo, a volunteer at plugged in, an east palo alto organization devoted to providing free high-tech training.\"i think a lot of the big computer companies in the area could do more,\" says arroyo. \"they donate money and equipment but they don't do enough to help train people.\"still, even arroyo admits that people who come into his office looking for work usually end up finding it. and he says a number of teens who get training go right into a web design business, where they can work from their homes, and don't have to bother with the late-night or weekend hours required of many entry-level retail jobs.the irony of the situation is that the labor shortage has actually created more work to be done. employment agencies and temp services who say their work used to be as simple as interviewing the people who came through their doors, are now having to do a lot of leg work.\"it's crazy,\" says sue kramer, owner of the menlo park, calif., employment agency career resources. \"we have to do all kinds of aggressive recruiting and attend a lot of job fairs.\"another area recruiter says she has taken to poring through the online resume services to fill some jobs. \"three or four years ago the phone was ringing constantly. people still call looking for work, but they are few and far between.\"copyright"}
