beat/london)recorded live with a 35-piece orchestra at nyc's roseland ballroom, pnyc represents a thaw in the mournful chill of portishead's scratchy sci-fi trip hop. from the retro sounds of \"humming\" to the big-band-in-a-graveyard beat of \"all mine,\" when the strings and horns rub up against the tremulous vocals of beth gibbons, it sparks a seductive soulfulness. just call it suite for ouija board.firesign theatregive me immortality or give me death (rhino)back in the late '60s, firesign theatre earned a rep as comedic avant-gardists with a wicked countercultural edge. and while the troupe's acid-flashback pop commentary has worn thin over time, there's something nostalgically ambitious about their new undertaking.the setting is a radio station broadcasting on december 31, 1999, as the countdown to y2k unfolds. \"radio now\" goes through a format change every three minutes, but none of the millennium-bound radio hosts notice. the group hasn't been as funny since the drugs wore off, but its heart is in the right place.&$161;cubanismo!reencarnaci\u00f2n (rykodisc)originally conceived as a one-shot, all-star recording project, &$161;cubanismo! has evolved into the neotraditionalist voice of cuban music. on reencarnaci\u00f2n, they demonstrate their stunning blend of jazz, mambo, son, guaracha, and other traditional forms. led by jes\u00f9s alema\u00f1y's smoking trumpet, they prove just how sexy cuban music can be.kronos quartet25 years (nonesuch)arguably the most important new-music ensemble of our time, kronos quartet celebrates its 25th anniversary with this stunning 10-cd set. kronos revitalized the string-quartet genre, commissioning and premi\u00e8ring some 400 pieces. the quartet's repertoire includes work by acclaimed classical composers as well as jimi hendrix, ornette coleman, and muddy waters, not to mention unclassifiable musicians like john zorn.their execution of reich's \"different trains,\" with its precise metric shifts and relentless rhythms, is breathtaking. the otherworldly sonorities of george crumb's bizarre \"black angels\" are subtle, brilliant, and electrifying. this extraordinary set only scratches the surface of what kronos has wrought.street crednow you're cookinggrand unified remote theorypocket pixhidden agendaliving up to the legendmachine manthe world at your fingertipsthe wrath of goddessmusicjust outta betareadmemaxpowr, minpricehack dreamsrules, schmules - it's thought-provokingservice by andrettefrom gear to eternitycontributors"}
