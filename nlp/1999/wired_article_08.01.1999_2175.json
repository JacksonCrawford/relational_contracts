(i did, however, subject my pug to several indoor flash shots; my girlfriend was compelled to color his eyes black to rid him of that satan's-minion look.) there is a residual bit of wonder in taking a photograph and instantly showing it to someone, suggestive of the putative belief among primitive peoples that cameras capture the soul. the photos become a kind of social currency, traded for laughs and instant remembrance.i-zone pocket camera, joycam, and popshots: $24.99, $24.99, and $19.99. polaroid: (800) 343 5000, street credbasement area networkhacking the vacuum tubefree of attachmentspolaroid's sticky portalburnt rubber, chicago stylebooting up beelzebubout of the celluloid closetreadmemusicsaar-sightedthe transreal thingi, nicklausamerican history f/xjust outta betalittle big screen\"it was just the law of large numbers at work\"contributors"}
