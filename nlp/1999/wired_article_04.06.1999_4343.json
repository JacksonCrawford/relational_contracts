(amsat) based in france and russia, according to documents posted to a swatch boycott page, maintained by rob carlson, a ham radio enthusiast.the satellite, originally called rs-19, was built for experimental and educational purposes. classed as a mini-sputnik, it's about the size of a soccer ball. it will store and transmit up to 10 messages, each about seven seconds long. new messages can be beamed up to the satellite every 24 hours. the satellite is battery driven and will operate for about 30 days.the satellite was transported to russia's mir space station on 2 april, according to a recent american radio relay league newsletter. a mir cosmonaut will reportedly open a hatch and literally throw it out into space sometime this month.but it appears swatch and the russian space flight control center (scsc), which launched the satellite, made a secret deal to use the satellite for swatch's advertising.the leaders of both the french and russian amsat teams deny any knowledge of plans to use the satellite for marketing purposes, according to documents published on the swatch boycott site. in the letters, the amsat leaders distance themselves from the project and apologize to the ham radio community.if broadcast, the swatch messages would be available on a single channel in a range of frequencies supposedly reserved for amateur communications. ham online's mitchell said the amateur bands are prohibited from commercial use by an international amateur radio treaty.the estimated millions of ham radio operators worldwide, 750,000 of which reside in the united states, would be able to hear the broadcast. so would listeners with radio scanners.swatch, which has said it will also post the messages on its web site, was not available for comment.it is unclear, however, if the satellite will be used only for swatch's advertising or whether amateur radio traffic will also be mixed in.carlson, who organized the swatch boycott, said it doesn't matter.\"it's the first step on a slippery slope,\" he said. \"they call it underwriting. but if it's allowed to progress, chances are they will try to get a little more each time. i've seen it before with public radio. it starts off with underwriting and ends up as 60-second advertising spots. then it's not underwriting any more, it's commercial advertising.\"the radio messages will advertise internet time, swatch's new timekeeping standard, according to swatch's web site. the company is calling for readers to submit voice messages. if they contain a swatch marketing buzzword, they will be broadcast around the globe from the satellite.\"i am appalled by your decision to advertise on amateur frequencies,\" said one of the messages submitted on swatch's site. \"by using amateur frequencies, not only will you fail to reach any potential market, but you will enrage thousands of amateur radio operators worldwide. i will encourage and support any possible litigation against your company to prevent this action or to seek damages as a result.\""}
