thursday as ibm was hammered after warning about future earnings, but other technology stocks refused to be drawn into the carnage. the dow jones industrial average ended down 94.67 points, or 0.91 percent, at 10,297.69 after an early loss of more than 200 points reversed wednesday's gain of 187 points.in the broader market, declines swamped advances by 1,875 to 1,147 on active volume of 988

fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2000. ibm, one of the 30 dow components, slumped 21-3/4 to 91. the company posted mixed third-quarter results due to slower spending as big clients made fixes related to computer problems associated with the year 2000.but more importantly, ibm warned of much lower than expected earnings into early next year.\"some of the selling fever from ibm caught on to other stocks,\" said dan ascani, president and director of research at global market strategists inc. \"that allowed for the buyers to come in and say 'this isn't so bad.'\"analysts said comments from edward kelley, governor of the federal reserve, that the us central bank would not target asset prices directly with its interest rate policy calmed fears that the fed is highly concerned about stock valuations.\"those statements that the fed is not going to target asset prices suggests the market doesn't have to worry about fed tightening if the market goes higher,\" ascani said. \"it probably helped the market. the nasdaq just didn't want to give up its gains.\"at a gathering of financial analysts, kelley said he was concerned that the nation's tight labor market might lead to a boom-and-bust cycle in the us economy. but he said the fed's primary responsibility was to tailor its interest rate policy to conditions in the overall economy and that targeting asset prices is \"not the business that we're in.\"also pressuring some stocks was the 30-year treasury bond's rising yield.the benchmark long bond's price slipped 9/32 with the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rising to 6.36 percent from 6.34 on wednesday.\"i think when ibm said it would take a couple of quarters to get over the y2k problem, it bothered a lot of people. i just believe the street is interpreting that there are deeper problems,\" said charles payne, head analyst at wall street strategies.payne said despite a slew of strong earnings from top companies, firms reporting profits a penny or two above consensus estimates \"are being greeted with a yawn.\"thomas galvin, chief investment officer at donaldson, lufkin and jenrette, said: \"the damage outside of ibm is
