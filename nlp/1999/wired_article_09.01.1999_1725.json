- - - -in a quiet room tucked away from the crowds roaming the halls of the internationale funkausstellung, the giant trade expo, bureaucrats, businessmen, policy wonks, and responsive citizens attended \"data protection: bridge between privacy and the global market.\"the berlin data protection commission, a state agency, held the symposium to dissect the merits and pitfalls of a networked planet.the dispute over data protection in europe is not necessarily about the principle itself, but how to ensure it. businesses, ever conscious of the risks of restraining innovation, want a hands-off approach. europe's governing bodies, on the other hand, believe the only guarantee for privacy in the electronic sector is legislation.the discussion came on the heels of a study released last week placing germany behind other western european countries in ecommerce enterprises. only 17 percent of german businesses engage in electronic commerce, while 22 percent of dutch, 25 percent of french, and 40 percent of british companies are active online.\"germany is the taillight [of ecommerce] in international comparisons,\" said bernd lantermann, director of the it consulting group cmg, which conducted the survey.at the symposium, the arguments for and against government intervention fell into predictable camps.the public administrators spoke at length about the need to strengthen regulations, pointing to abuses of overseas -- especially us -- corporations. and business leaders derided rules that new technologies and business plans make obsolete before the ink dries.alexander dix, commissioner for data protection in the state of brandenburg, began on a defensive note.\"deregulation is en vogue. regulations are seen as more bureaucracy, more red tape, and a deterrent to the free flow of the data highways.\"\"it is like this with online banking. the internet service falls under the telecom rules, but banking belongs to more general directives\" and is therefore not exposed to the same scrutiny.what's more, internet companies in the united states are frustrating the mandate of the eu directive on data protection, implemented last october to give europeans more control over their data. it requires a consumer's consent before his data can be processed and prohibits using it for any other reason than originally stated.but direct marketers in the united states who use email re-purpose this data without fear of penalty. \"spamming is unregulated in the united states. there is no monitoring,\" dix said, citing cases where excessive spamming has jammed servers and denied service to users in germany.moving on to ecommerce, dix said, \"i do not want to talk euphoria and profits expected and growth in the stock market. i want to talk about how electronic commerce is harming privacy.\"it is not possible to move without traces, like in the real world marketplace. there are no means for anonymous or pseudonymous purchases online. without this, there will never be sufficient trust among consumers \ufffd and economic deprivation would follow.\"anne carblanc of the organization for economic cooperation and development staked out a gentler position.\"the oecd's 29 member nations \ufffd have different cultures, and that means some prefer self-regulation. others consider data protection a priority,\" she said. \"the oecd builds the bridges.\"to foster the flow of technology between its members, which include europe, north america, and japan, carblanc said a resolution for global standards and the development of privacy-enhancing technologies are necessary.people are worried about privacy, bernd schiphorst president and ceo of bertelsmann new media, acknowledged. he quoted figures that show a \"less than ideal situation\" in germany: while 33 percent of french and 67 percent of british consumers use their credit cards online, only 23 percent of germans do, he said.aol europe, bertelsmann's joint venture with america online, claims 900,000 members in germany. keeping those customers happy means maintaining privacy standards. \"users must only submit the basic information for accounting purposes, such as address and telephone number, and it is secured,\" schiphorst said.\"data protection is not lip service. we're trying to solve the issues before someone tells us we have to.\""}
