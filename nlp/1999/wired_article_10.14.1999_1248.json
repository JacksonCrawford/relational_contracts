"in a study that refutes a century of popular belief about the brain, scientists have found that humans are not necessarily stuck with the number of brain cells they were born with after all. researchers from  princeton university discovered that new neurons are continually added to the cerebral cortex of adult monkeys, which, if true for humans, could one day lead to new therapies for memory loss, brain damage, and diseases like alzheimer's.\"the monkey is fundamentally like the human,\" said psychology professor charles gross, who conducted the study with associate psychology professor elizabeth gould. \"there is no way that this can't go on in humans. it's inconceivable that it doesn't.\"gould and gross found that neurogenesis \u2013- the formation of new neurons or nerve cells \u2013- takes place in several regions of a monkey's cerebral cortex, the part of the brain that is believed crucial for thinking, decision-making, as well as understanding and learning about the world.for the better part of the last century, neuroscientists have believed that the brain, unlike other organs, did not grow new cells or repair itself.\"it's always been that you're born with all that you'll ever have,\" said william greenough, director of the neuroscience program at the beckman institute at the university of illinois. \"we've always argued that the adult brain was not capable of normal cell proliferation.\"but prior studies proved that neurogenesis does in fact occur in the brains of monkeys, but only in the older, more primitive parts of the brain, like the olfactory system, or the hippocampus, which is thought to control aspects of memory formation.despite that new evidence, however, many scientists believed that any formation of new neurons in the adult brain had to be an aberration and that the structure of the brain was stable and unchanging.but the gould/gross findings, which will appear in the 15 october issue of the journal science show that there are natural mechanisms in the brain that form new brain cells, which could ultimately prove useful in creating therapies for brain diseases, like parkinson's or alzheimer's, or replacing cells lost due to stroke or injury.the team found that new brain cells were formed in the lining of the cerebral ventricles, located deep in the middle of the brain, and later scattered to far-reaching regions of the cerebral cortex.\"we've shown that there are new cells that move long distances to particular places in the brain,\" gross said. \"if we could understand the conditions that control the formation of new cells and why they migrate to new places, maybe we could use this natural process to treat diseases that involve the loss of cells.\"the findings could also dispel widely accepted notions about the process of brain development, scientists said. the current notion is that prime brain development occurs from infancy to three years of age. but gould argues that experiences later in life up through adulthood can have a significant effect on the brain's structure and functions.\"people thought: if the cerebral cortex is important in memory, how could it change?\" he said in a statement. \"in fact the opposite view is at least as plausible: if memories are formed from experiences, these experience must produce changes in the brain.\"in order to test for new brain cell growth, gould and gross injected a chemical called brdu into the brains of rhesus monkeys, which are known for their similarity to humans in brain structure. the chemical, which incorporates itself into the dna of newly formed cells, showed up in all cases in the neurons in the monkeys' cerebral cortex.subsequent tests proved that the new cells had extended axons, the long extensions of neurons that send messages to other cells, which suggests that the new cells were functioning well and participating in the brain's circuitry.\"we think it opens up a whole new set of experiments as to what these new cells are doing, and what can they tell us about learning and memory,\" gross said.while the results of the study could lead to theoretical changes in neuroscience, scientists caution that the formation of new neurons has not been proven in humans yet, and future applications for cell replenishment and repair are still a long way off.\"if it's true in humans, this opens the door,\" said greenough, \"but what's in the room behind that we have yet to figure that out.\"check yourself into med-techcheck yourself into med-tech"}
