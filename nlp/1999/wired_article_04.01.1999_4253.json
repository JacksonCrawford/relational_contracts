(y2k is similarly timed, as new year's eve 1999 falls on a friday.)like ontario hydro, mercury underestimated the time needed to restore electricity. its first pronouncement was that power would be back within a week; instead, full restoration of power took five weeks, and short intermittent outages continued until may. the utility also joined city officials in issuing an \"urgent notice\" advising residents without power to evacuate and instructing people outside the cbd to stay away. to many downtown businesspeople, this was both a crippling blow and an act of extreme disloyalty by the mayor, les mills. he responded, with justification, that he had to consider public safety over the merchants' welfare, but few merchants were persuaded. their anger was a factor in mills's defeat in last october's election.in the first few days of the outage, power inside the cbd switched on and off unpredictably. people got trapped in elevators. fire alarms went off randomly. security doors locked shut when they were supposed to be open, and stayed open when they should have closed. in a diary entry for monday, february 23, three days after the outage began, a local journalist named andrew heal wrote: \"girlfriend goes for run at crack of dawn. power goes off and she is locked out, so she stands in the middle of the street and bellows my name. three sleepy, unshaven faces appear at three separate windows. great way to meet the neighbors.\"foul, noisy generators soon cluttered the cbd's sidewalks. when a generator in a coffee shop exploded, a wall of smoke surged through the ground floor of the shopping arcade, preceded by fleeing customers. corry stoop, owner of a boutique, ran to close her door just before the smoke cloud arrived. a second later, she recalls, \"i couldn't see across the hall.\"auckland became the butt of jokes (\"question: what did auckland have before candles? answer: electricity\"), and the townspeople's fragile self-esteem was a major casualty. suddenly auckland was being compared to - horror of horrors! - a third world city, and newspapers around the world trumpeted the cbd's plight. worse, some exaggerated. a four-column headline in the jakarta post read, auckland evacuated due to power crisis. a new york times headline said, power failure threatens new zealand economy. in fact, most of auckland functioned normally throughout the outage, and the impact on the national economy was negligible. the reports had an effect on tourism, however: 30 to 40 percent of hotel reservations were canceled, even though the 25 hotels in the cbd continued to run on generators.once the outage began, mercury gathered generators from australia and elsewhere in new zealand to provide temporary power. it even got permission from the rock group u2 to borrow the world's largest cargo plane, a russian antonov-124, to transport giant generators from australia. (u2 was performing in sydney, and didn't need the plane to ship their concert gear for another couple of days.) the biggest generators were deployed to reinforce mercury's substations; the utility's major customers were given smaller generators.most established businesses managed to cope without mercury's help. the bank of new zealand closed its nine cbd branches and transferred its employees to other branches. buddle findlay, a leading law firm, installed isdn lines in four partners' homes and a rented motel, and moved its computer network to the new locales. still, productivity suffered as lawyers discovered just how much they relied on paper documents, whose retrieval now required a trip to the cbd and a hike up 20 floors of a darkened high-rise.it was the cbd's small businesses that suffered most. of the 1,000 retailers located there, only about 200 remained open throughout the outage, as the number of patrons dwindled in the district's caf\u00e9s, clothing stores, pubs, and gift shops. many were marginal businesses to begin with, but the blackout ensured their demise. alex swney, general manager of a cbd lobbying group called heart of the city, estimates that business failures doubled during the first half of the year, but concedes that most eventually would have collapsed even without the outage.some established businesses were among the casualties. colin forster had run a greeting-card shop in the cbd for four years, and hoped to retire with his wife on its earnings. but by the time his landlord reopened the building with generators 10 days after the outage began, his customers had found alternatives. instead of 200 customers a day, he was lucky to get 10. with cash-flow problems mounting, he closed the shop and dismissed his three employees. forster got a job as a taxi driver, and says his wife \"came very close to having a nervous breakdown.\"true enough, some people flourished during the outage; disasters, after all, sometimes speed up the normal process of dog-eat-dog. peter cammell, a self-described risk taker who calls himself \"cammell the chemist,\" owned one pharmacy in the cbd when the outage started. by the time its ripples played out, he owned two and ran two more. emboldened by his insurer's promise that his outage losses would be covered, he bought newspaper ads and sent out a mailing to 3,000 customers announcing special offers in his own store, while other cbd pharmacies hurtled toward bankruptcy. then he began buying them up. \"in a small business you don't get a lot of opportunities,\" he says. \"unless you react very quickly, you get rubbed out.\"many aucklanders insist that mercury behaved knavishly. about 1,400 auckland businesses that suffered outage-related losses banded together to file a class-action lawsuit against the utility, but they have been stymied by new zealand's legal system, which does not readily acknowledge joint suits. mercury offered customers compensation, though the sums usually amounted to a fraction of losses. some claimants speculate that compensation was designed to be just enough to dissuade them from joining the suit. mercury declined entirely to offer compensation to tenant merchants lacking direct electricity accounts. though these merchants' losses were just as real as their landlords' - and usually more substantial, since many landlords had collected rent throughout the outage - mercury accepted no responsibility for them. in the event of a y2k outage, the moral is inescapable: don't count on utilities to cover losses.in an apparent effort to diffuse support for the lawsuit, mercury also misled outage victims. tim chamberlain, owner of a three-employee graphic design firm called streamline creative, had to relocate his studio five times during the outage to keep the business afloat. at a cbd information booth mercury set up during the crisis, chamberlain asked whether the utility would cover his claim even though his landlord held his building's electricity account. three mercury officials assured him he qualified, he says, yet when he filed his claim in may, mercury refused to cover it. enraged, he phoned a claims representative and told her about the conversation at the information booth. she said the mercury officials had \"wrongly advised\" him.while the auckland city council joined mercury in establishing a relief fund that reimbursed each small business up to nz$2,000 ($1,100), a fraction of most businesses' losses, the national government showed little interest, maintaining that the dispute was strictly between mercury and the merchants. prime minister jenny shipley spent a few hours touring the cbd, then spent the afternoon on a yacht.a year later, most aucklanders' memories of the outage are starting to fade - only a small percentage of them, after all, felt its impact - but a distinct feeling about it persists. i found that out at the end of an amiable conversation with a taxi driver, who suddenly realized he was dropping me at the bunker-like edifice of mercury's headquarters. \"we're not ready to forgive them yet,\" he said solemnly.in the end, at least, a certain kind of justice was served, for the outage cost mercury at least nz$128 million. moreover, the utility itself fell victim to a government divestiture decree last april, and is being reduced to less than half its former size. the company has pledged that it will not allow another outage to occur, and has increased the reliability and capacity of its infrastructure by installing new overhead and underground cables to the cbd.even so, mercury wasn't the biggest casualty of the outage. it was, as usual, confidence, a belief in the invulnerability of the power supply and the security of modern life. this is supposed to be a big year for new zealand, one that finally ushers it to its rightful place in the world. as many as 20 world leaders, including president clinton, are expected to attend an asia-pacific economic cooperation conference in auckland in september. in october, the city welcomes 15 challengers for the america's cup, yachting's most famous competition.last comes the millennium itself, a far bigger deal in new zealand than in most other nations. new zealand, after all, is just west of the international date line, which means it will be the largest of the first few countries in the world to greet 2000, and many celebrations are planned. if outages ensue, it will be new zealand's fate to warn the rest of the world that it has a few hours to get ready."}
