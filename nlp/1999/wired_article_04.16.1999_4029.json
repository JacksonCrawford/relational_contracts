[instead] it's being zoned through technology -- by people adding bells and whistles.\"nichols said a company can't be aware of all such issues ahead of time.\"everybody should realize this is an ongoing kind of battle. it's the same thing that companies have to battle when you talk about security issues. are we going to catch every kind of bug before it goes out?\"nichols also pointed out that no personal information is passed to that site that hasn't already been provided in the past.\"sites today can see your ip address and associate it with a page that you hit. is there a really critical privacy issue there? i don't think it's something to be concerned about. but it's something users might want to be aware of.\"wired news did not find similar behavior in the netscape navigator browser, and the company said unique requests are not transmitted to sites when bookmarking a web page."}
