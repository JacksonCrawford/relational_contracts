mounted on concrete poles, they literally spin in the wind. by leander kahney.", "author": "leander kahney", "category": "science", "type": "article", "timestamp": "11.02.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "in a few months bruce campbell will be joining a first class club of homeowners -- people who live in converted airliners. campbell, a 49-year-old bachelor who sells scientific test equipment, is preparing to move into an boeing 727 tucked away in the woods near hillsboro, oregon.campbell is busy installing the plumbing, fixing the electricity, and reattaching the wings, which had to be removed for transport.\"i won't be moving in for a least a few months yet\" said campbell, who is weary of removing the inexplicable clumps of paper clips that have wedged themselves in the molding and carpeting throughout the plane. \"they're everywhere,\" said campbell.\"it would have been such a shame to cut it up and melt it down. it would have been a waste\" said campbell, who claims his neighbors love the jumbo dwelling.when he checks in full time, campbell will become only the second person in the country to live in an old converted airliner. joanne usserly lives aboard an old 727 down in benoit, mississippi, according to campbell.but others soon may be coming on board to their way of thinking about plane living.max power aerospace of smyrna, tennessee, has three boeing 727s ready to be converted into two- or three-bedroom homes. the houses will sell for $290,000 and will include two bathrooms, a small kitchen and a large living area in the middle.after stripping out all of the seats and overhead compartments, the 12-foot wide, 100-foot long planes yield 1,200 square feet of living space, the company said.while most customers will prefer to leave the cockpits intact, the former flight control areas can be turned into a master bedroom or accommodate a hot tub, said tom bennington, max power's president. he added that the wings could be turned into a pair of 50-foot decks for soaking up the sun.the planes will be mounted on concrete pedestals with a swiveling bearing originally designed for tank turrets, said bennington. using techniques developed for cranes on construction sites, all the sewer lines, plumbing, electricity, and other cables will be passed through the bearing and will continue to work even if the plane is moving.the company claims the planes are capable of standing up to the most powerful storms, and is zeroing in on residents of the hurricane-plagued florida keys as potential buyers.\"when the wind comes up, they rotate around to point into the wind,\" said bennington. \"that is what they were originally designed to do.\"the airliner homes will be guaranteed to withstand winds of up to 280 mph, bennington said.the planes can be mounted out at sea, too, at depths of up to 140 feet, said bennington. the first prospective customer, a radio station in nashville, is toying with the idea of mounting the plane above the roof of its two-story headquarters and using it as a broadcasting studio.in a lot of cases, the pedestal will be high enough to keep the plane out of the path of the flying debris whipped up by a hurricane, bennington said.bennington said he's patented the concept of using old planes as hurricane-proof shelters. he came up with the idea because he thought it was a shame to cut up the fuselages after they'd been stripped.\"they're really fabulous structures,\" he said. \"they don't wear out. they don't rot. they don't rust. it's truly the best quality home you can expect to get.\"ernst keisling, a civil engineering professor at the wind science and engineering center at texas tech university, who specializes in structures, said airplanes are ideal structures to ride out strong winds.\"if properly anchored, the plane should weather a storm pretty well,\" he said. \"the only problem is the danger of flying debris.\"however, keisling said home owners can probably find more economical ways to protect themselves from powerful cyclones than a $300,000 aircraft. pre-fab shelters typically cost between $2,000 and $4,000, he said.keisling also questioned whether people would want to live in an old airliner. \"i think i'd prefer something much more conventional.\"\"it's an interesting idea,\" said frank lepore, a spokesman for the national hurricane center.every year, hurricanes cause $4.5 billion in damage, disrupting the lives of the 47 million people who live along a strip of coastland and 50 miles inland from brownsville, texas, to portland, maine. it's a pretty big market, lepore said.the strongest recorded gust of wind at ground level is 231 mph, according to the national hurricane center.\"i would say they'll have no trouble getting [customers] attention,\" he said.as for campbell, he lived in a mobile home for 30 years to save up for his dream home, which previously flew for olympia, greece's national carrier, for 30 years.but he expects his aerodynamic homestead to last forever. \"it's extraordinarily strong,\" he said.\"it's just so well built. anything aerospace is done at a higher level [of quality] than any other human activity.\""}
