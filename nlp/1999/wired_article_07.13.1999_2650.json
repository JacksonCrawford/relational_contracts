quality in programming. but a study released yesterday by  forrester research suggests that digital tv already has one foot in the grave.\"unless current market conditions change dramatically, digital television is going to fail,\" said ekaterina walsh, an analyst at forrester research and author of the study.read more about digital tv- - - - - -among 10,000 consumers surveyed, forrester found that almost a third of americans haven't even heard of digital television, despite the fact that the technology has been on the market for almost a year now.\"it's looking like the entire consumer electronics industry is living on the 'build it and they'll come' theory. and that's not going to work,\" walsh said. \"if consumers don't know what it is, they won't buy it.\"digital television, or dtv, was unveiled in the american market last year. relying on digital streams of data rather than analog waveforms to build the images and sounds that tv sets produce, dtv allows for a wide range of applications, including interactive programming and near-movie theater quality images.using a dtv technology known as multichannel broadcasting, stations can transmit up to four channels in the same bandwidth that one analog channel requires.to date, only 25,000 digital-ready tvs and set-top receivers have been sold, according to the consumer electronics manufacturers association.\"the problem is that digital tv isn't really fulfilling an obvious need that consumers have. it's a 'push' rather than 'pull' product,\" said walsh. forrester predicts that consumers won't bite until high-definition digital television systems can be had for about us$2,000, or about 60 percent less than the cheapest models currently available.compounding the gloomy outlook, sinclair broadcast group -- the nation's largest broadcaster, with 59 stations nationwide -- recently began a campaign to scrap the agreed upon standard for digital television broadcasting, saying it is technically flawed.last march, sinclair conducted studies in philadelphia where residents of urban areas with expensive digital sets -- particularly inside large buildings \ufffd- had difficulty receiving digital content due to a problem known as \"multipath distortion.\"similar to an echo, multipath distortion occurs when broadcast signals bounce off of large objects such as buildings or mountains. if the bounced signal and the direct signal aren't in synch, the data will be scrambled.traditional analog television suffers from the same problems, resulting in \"ghosting\", or slightly off-set images. dtv receivers, however, cannot interpret the scrambled signal at all and will display an error message instead.digital cable subscribers don't suffer the same problems since standards have not been set and widespread use has been delayed because of ongoing disagreements over the fcc's must-carry rules.sinclair believes that the multipath distortion problems are caused by shortcomings of the 8-channel vestigial sideband (8vsb) transmission standard, which has been mandated for use by all broadcasters in the united states by the federal communications commission.the fcc has set a target date of 2006 for all tv stations to be broadcasting digitally. at that point, traditional analog televisions will become obsolete unless equipped with a digital set-top receiver/translator.instead, sinclair advocates moving to europe's cofdm standard that is optimized to deal with multipath distortion.the advanced television systems committee (atsc), an industry consortium which developed the 8vsb standard, argues that the european standard requires a signal that's more than twice as strong as that required by 8vsb in order to achieve equal coverage -- and that the added power of the signal would interfere with analog television signals.sinclair's tests \"basically showed the [european] system to work better in certain situations, which is old news really,\" said craig tanner, executive director of the atsc, who witnessed sinclair's side-by-side tests of the two transmission technologies monday.\"switching to the cofdm standard would tilt optimization heavily in favor of inner-city areas at the expense of the huge areas at the fringes of broadcasters' coverage areas, which is not a tilt we favor,\" said tanner. \"cities tend to be heavily cable-subscribed, so there was an assumption that the best thing to do was provide coverage area for outlying areas.\"sixty-nine broadcast stations have already upgraded to 8vsb broadcast facilities at an average cost of between $8-12 million per station. sinclair says switching to the european standard would only cost another $50,000 per station, a figure disputed by others within the industry.switching to cofdm would be even more expensive for electronics manufacturers who would have to recall all dtv receivers sold to date.\"any engineering system is a tradeoff,\" noted tanner. \"all physical problems are bounded, and you can tilt the design in favor of one or two parameters but you're guaranteed to give up others.\"others in the industry are less forgiving of sinclair's eleventh-hour bid to reopen standards discussions.\"it's like china calling the us [women's] soccer team and saying, 'how about best two out of three?'\" said jeff joseph, a vice president at the consumer electronics manufacturers association. \"the fact is, sinclair and the other proponents of different standards have had their day in court, and 8vsb won.\"\"sinclair wants to stall the works a bit as they face the costs of implementing digital technology in their stations,\" asserted greg tarr, senior editor of this week in consumer electronics.many in the digital tv industry believe that the majority of reception problems associated with digital broadcasts relate primarily to the receiver equipment rather than the format itself.\"by everyone's assessment, the first-generation receivers will be the worst ones made,\" said dennis wharton, a senior vice president for the national association of broadcasters. \"with a proper receiver in place, the american system will deliver a perfectly fine picture.\"nevertheless, with such poor consumer understanding of the technology, concerns over signal reliability can only compound the troubles for dtv.walsh said that any consumer uncertainty will spell trouble for a market desperately trying to get on the consumer's radar.\"if consumers worry that their new tv is going to be obsolete in three years, they're going to wait to buy it.\""}
