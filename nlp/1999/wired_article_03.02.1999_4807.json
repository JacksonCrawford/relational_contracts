authority will work to hammer out its identity and formal structure. analysis by chris oakes.", "author": "chris oakes", "category": "security", "type": "article", "timestamp": "03.02.1999 09:45 AM", "text": "the creation of heaven and earth came off with relative ease compared to what's being attempted in singapore this week. that's where the members of the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers (icann) will hammer out structural issues that will guide the internet into the future.icann is expected to serve as the internet's oversight body. but first it must create a membership structure, generate internal support, and assume the duties carried out by the former internet assigned numbers authority.the tasks, assigned to icann in its bylaws, are the product of a joint agreement signed with the us department of commerce in november. the group is very much a work in progress -- like a table building its own legs.icann's decisions and policies will have a profound impact on the domain name infrastructure and those who administer it. so the group is taking its first baby steps amid vociferous criticism.high among the complaints: an unelected board of directors will be making organizational decisions with long-term impact before a formal icann membership body can chime in. worse, critics charge, many of the decisions made this week will be made behind closed doors and out of the public eye.icann has responded that many people have misunderstood the group's purpose. the group's administrators say that they are not being granted the breathing room they need, and that naysayers are holding them to standards and criteria that are neither realistic nor relevant.starting on tuesday of this week and continuing until thursday, the icann board will hear recommendations from an advisory committee on the subject of its own membership and consider other structural issues. two of the most controversial issues going in to the conference are sure to see a lively debate in this week's meetings.membershipicann's membership advisory committee is studying membership models and will make recommendations to icann's board. at icann's request, the berkman center at harvard law school has been studying possible membership structures. the center has produced three models that range from total inclusion to a limited structure.the most open -- and perhaps least likely -- model would invite just about anyone on the net to join icann. but this model, dubbed \"open,\" would channel precious little revenue to fuel icann operations, the researchers said. also, they said it will likely generate too little interaction between members.two other membership models, -- \"individual\" and \"organizations\" -- look more likely to take hold.the latter scheme, the berkman center said, will reduce membership administration expenses. it encourages individuals to form associations that can then join icann and vote in accordance with the majority wishes of their members. this model would allow for healthy funding of icann's activities.individual membership would still be possible under such a plan, but the high price of dues would preclude many from signing up.the middle-of-the-road model would allow member individuals to vote, but not in all decisions. rather, members would vote on \"at-large\" policy decisions. organizations would have no vote. the berkman center said this model's revenue-generating potential would cover icann's expenses.the organization-favoring model is also touted for giving no single membership class absolute power.the membership issue has been controversial from the get-go. much of this stems from concern that the final course will be decided by a hand-picked, unelected board -- and not by the internet community at large.domain supportersicann board discussions will also consider the issue of \"domain name supporting organizations\" (dnso) -- a special icann body that will determine policy on top-level domain administration and registrars.top-level domains (tlds) are those that end in suffixes such as .com and .org and would include new alternative extensions being discussed such as .biz. network solutions is in charge of setting aside reservations within the .com, .net, and .org top-level domains. other companies want to do the same for other tlds.the policy advisory body of the dnso will consist of a general assembly, a \"names council,\" and a set of constituencies. members will include representatives from domain name registries.the names council will recommend new tlds, including operation, assignment, and management of the domain name system.the starting point for discussions within the dnso will be that current registries operate under current request for comments documents. but since the purpose of the dnso will be to provide a process for new top-level domain registrars, would-be registrars are watching closely."}
