election day is to wake up, eat breakfast, stroll over to his pc, and vote. westen, president of the election information web site  dnet, thinks voters should be able to receive all of the information they need about candidates and the issues from key political information portals, then cast their ballots from home.\"if you can buy a yacht on the net, you can vote on the net,\" said westen, who is also president of the center for governmental studies, a nonprofit organization devoted to increasing voter participation.\"at some point in the future we will review the candidates' positions, get answers on the issues, look at endorsers, check the news, mark a sample ballot as we go, change our minds a few times, check what we've done, and print it out and take it to the polls ... or upload it,\" westen said.he is not alone in his quest to streamline the political process and deliver it to the nation's personal computers and laptops.with municipal elections being held nationwide on tuesday -- and a presidential election a mere 12 months away -- politicians, technology advocates, and grassroots organizers have been banking on the internet to revitalize the nation's interest in voting.in iowa, chet culver, the nation's youngest secretary of state, has spearheaded a pilot program that will allow iowans to vote on the internet for the first time, as part of a mock net election.the goal: to get younger voters psyched about, uh, voting again.\"we have historical lows with voter participation and turnout -- especially among young people,\" he said. \"they feel intimidated by the process or uncomfortable with the procedure and this will hopefully make it easier for young people to vote.\"in the 1996 presidential election, only 15 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds voted, compared to 50 percent in 1972, culver said.\"never has there been a more important time to explore the technology and try to turn this problem around,\" culver said. \"this might be the answer to get more young people connected to the process.\"the pilot program, run by washington-based votehere.net, will be tested tuesday in eight precincts throughout iowa. after voting the traditional way, volunteer voters will log in on a nearby computer where they'll point and click in an online ballot before answering a few questions about the mock vote. the iowa test is one of a dozen or so similar mock net elections conducted around the country by votehere.net since april. the results have been pretty encouraging, company officials say.in a recent mock net election involving nearly 7,000 virginia high school students, nearly 61 percent of \"registered voters\" turned out -- a number that would make today's political strategists drool.but security issues may prevent internet voting from catching on quickly, officials said.\"the technology is baked and ready, but people have these fears about security,\" said votehere.net spokesman nathaniel clevenger. \"the difference is the speed. you can have instant results -\u2013 tallied within minutes -- and it scares people who are used to the old political ways. we need to make this simple for folks to understand how the future of net voting is so bright.\"security should not be an issue, culver said. \"we can transfer money over the phone and withdraw money from atms. we have safe and secure technology in place in many aspects of our society, and it's time to explore this technology for the voting process.\"dnet's westen views fears about net voting as an old problem in a new format. \"security and identity problems exist, but they do with absentee ballots, too. these are not new problems.\"on the other hand, the sorry state of voter participation is a relatively new problem, according to westen, who believes net voting is the only way to engage busy and uninspired citizens.\"the cost of voting is high, and the net lowers the transaction costs substantially,\" he said. \"to take voting seriously, you've got to think about which way to go. to get information means outreach and time, and nobody has the time for that. if you let people get that information quickly off the net, a lot of people will start voting.\"the campaign staff of san francisco write-in mayoral candidate tom ammiano has harnessed the email lists of supporters to reach potential voters in his eleventh-hour campaign.\"we've been using email like crazy,\" said belinda griswold, ammiano's volunteer media coordinator. \"our first big round of volunteers came from email lists we've been getting from all our friends and neighbors.... this is not a big-money campaign. there is no paid staff, and what we have is technology that is very useful to us.\"one woman donated her personal email list comprising more than 5,000 lesbians (ammiano is gay), instructing people on how to help with the write-in candidacy. \"we've done a lot of stuff that way,\" griswold said.individual web campaigns may prove to be less effective when myriad sites of political parties and special interests start to clutter the net, westen said.\"the future is one-stop shopping -- the electronic shopping mall -- where you look at one candidate, get some information, and move on,\" he said.\"you can have anything you want in a few clicks -- that is nirvana for voters, and candidates have to realize it's nirvana for them too. we need sites that will pull voters and candidates into one place.\"fec rules, campaigns droolfec rules, campaigns drool"}
