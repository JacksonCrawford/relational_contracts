get a slice of the online billion-dollar pie? discussion ensues at the new york music internet & expo. jennifer sullivan reports from new york.", "author": "jennifer sullivan", "category": "business",

venture capitalists, and thousands of unsigned artists.but they were all there over the weekend for the new york music internet & expo, a gathering where unknowns looking to go online could meet potential business partners face to face. and it was mp3 that drew the crowds.the expo was sponsored by mp3.com and mp3 software maker musicmatch, but also drew other mp3 poster children and businesses looking for a fat slice of the music industry's pie.\"the record labels are middlemen,\" said ashwood kavanna, an attorney who has also managed jimi hendrix and miles davis. \"in the age of the net, middlemen are roadkill. let's kick out the jams ...\"none of the major labels were in attendance, so between the chaos of gothic groaning, caribbean rhythms, and guitar licks from the various bands, plenty of record industry bashing took place. during the panel discussions, most of the entertainment lawyers, artists, and business execs agreed that artists are getting screwed in offline record deals. but that could all change with the revolution now taking place on the net, where labels don't have pricing and distribution control.but with all this mp3 attention, no one is sure how unknown artists will make money online. \"there are a million different business models being floated now,\" said ken hertz, an oft-quoted attorney who represents performers like will smith and alanis morissette.mp3 is the headline-snatching audio compression format that lets users send files over the net. the format has tons of users, but it also allows for easy copying, and lots of mp3 files are illegal.the big labels have yet to embrace a format for selling music in a downloadable fashion online, and are trying to develop a specification through the secure digital music initiative by year's end.meanwhile, businesses have sprung up around mp3 to offer music online today.\"we don't want to be a yahoo\" of mp3, said angelo sotira, 18-year-old president of dimension music, an mp3 site for unsigned bands that competes with mp3.com. \"people want the good stuff.\" sotira -- who said to look for him in an upcoming forbes column -- is selective about the bands appearing on his site, which attracts anywhere from 20,000 to 30,000 unique visitors a day.but the \"yahoo of mp3\" is exactly what mp3.com has been called by its investors at sequoia capital.\"there's a lot of crappy music on the net [and] on our site,\" said michael robertson, founder of mp3.com. \"but somebody has to make the choice. should it be a record label or a consumer?\" robertson said he's signing up 100 bands a day to his dam online record label, which promotes physical cds with free mp3 files and splits sales 50-50 with the artist.but dennis mudd, chief executive of musicmatch, believes that a combination of subscriptions, where a consumer pays a flat fee for unlimited music, and advertising revenues from sites will have to pay artists for their downloaded music. musicmatch will launch their subscription service with songs.com on monday.online record label goodnoise signs artists like frank black and they might be giants to sell their downloadable tracks for 99 cents each or $8.99 an album in mp3.\"i'm totally against that model,\" said dimension music's sotira. \"in the future, it will be about paying a subscription fee,\" he said.mp3.com on monday will begin offering their artists the option to either charge for their mp3s or to give them away.david charles is trying out future models today. he started audiodiner and noisebox after doing a stint as a currency options trader in chicago. audiodiner pays artists five cents per mp3 or liquid audio download, but offers consumers free music, and gets between 50,000 and 100,000 people visiting each month. noisebox pays artists 15-20 percent of ad revenues. charles said he's breaking even because of advertising revenues and other supplemental sales.whatever model an artist may choose to go with, hitting the big time online is also harder if there's more competition. good marketing like collecting email addresses and finding ways to start a buzz is key.\"no one's going to magically come buy your music\" on the net, said marc deschenaux of online retailer cdworld. but artists shouldn't sign away their rights to an online entity either. \"make sure you don't get screwed by someone new.\"the expo hosted its share of small start-ups pitching their web sites, software, hardware, distribution connections, or counseling to young artists.but not everyone there was sold on exclusively using mp3.\"security -- it can survive, it is important,\" said jeff wood of audiohighway.com. \"if you get a record deal, maybe it comes in at that point.\" mp3 advocates like robertson say security limits consumers' freedom to do what they want with the music.mp3s take a while to download. and for real audiophiles, \"the sound quality is not where it needs to be yet,\" said joe alexander, an engineer and producer for the likes of george clinton and acdc.but many speakers were insistent that an unknown artist will break using mp3 very soon. hertz thinks in the future, such artists will have the clout to sign up with a label yet retain their downloadable music rights.\"some artist will be so heavily sought after because of their unsigned success ... the record labels [won't be able to] pass up the opportunity,\" said hertz. \"can the labels trust each other in resisting the temptation? these guys have done a bad job of predicting the future.\"mp3.com has a marketing agreement with wired digital's hotbot."}
