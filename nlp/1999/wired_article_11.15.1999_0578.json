[napster could say], 'we're the wrong target ... we're not responsible,'\" lutzker said.he called this suit \"a stretch.\"lutzker said the riaa could strengthen its case if they also prosecuted individual users of napster who use the software to trade illegal files.twenty years ago, the movie industry sued sony over its betamax videorecorder and also sued a few individuals, lutzker said. the case went all the way to the supreme court before sony finally won.the riaa has recently been actively enforcing its copyright rights. the organization recently approached the university of south carolina after a student was serving up illegal mp3 files from his computer. earlier this month, 71 students at carnegie mellon were disciplined for illegal mp3 use, after the riaa sent the school letters threatening a lawsuit.some digital music fans were upset at the current lawsuit.\"this appears to be a case where [the] riaa's suit could ... be thrown out of court for being frivolous,\" wrote charles groschen, a software engineer and amateur musician, in an email.\"this is a really awful move on [the riaa's] part,\" said audio consultant david weekly. \"if what they're trying to do is prevent programs like napster from coming out, they gave every teenage hacker the incentive to write their own ... if executives have in the back closet similar distribution programs like napster, what are the best hackers in the world working on?\""}
