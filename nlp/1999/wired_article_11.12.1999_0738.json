people in minutes, it sucks in contributions like a championship hoover, and it's a hell of a lot cheaper than direct mail. but email as a political tool is volatile and fickle, too -- as a couple of underdog presidential candidates are learning.democrat bill bradley and republican steve forbes, who have used email most effectively, are engaged in particularly urgent and defensive email scuffles, although not with each other and not necessarily to their benefit.bradley, the former new jersey senator, engaged in a behind-the-scenes net-based tussle with the gore camp wednesday after the vice president's campaign staffers sent out a media-directed email announcing the release of a new tv ad on children's health coverage.on thursday, bradley's team responded to the gore email by sending an email to its media list that pointed to gore's alleged use of copycat tactics in the new ad campaign.although the war of words was also transmitted via fax, this illustrates how much more quickly the information reaches its intended destination than by assembling a hasty press conference or paying for a rapid-fire tv spot.\"[email] has become a very effective tool,\" said bill bradley spokesman eric hauser. \"it\u2019s a way to disseminate a lot of information very quickly and efficiently. if the servers are working the people are going to get it.\"forbes, meanwhile, notorious for his below-the-belt campaign tactics, has engaged in a little email combat of his own. only this time, it's with himself.the billionaire publisher, whose tricked-out web site is among the most elaborate of the candidates, sent out a mistaken email to nearly 40,000 supporters, thanking them for \"maxing out\" to his campaign by \"contributing the $1,000 legal maximum.\"the email was meant to reach the supporters who had shelled out the dough, but the missive accidentally went to everybody who hadn't.webmaster rick segal, who runs internet strategy for the forbes campaign, sent out an apologetic note a day later, taking the blame for the electronic gaffe.\"the email you received last night or this morning said you had 'maxed out' to the forbes presidential campaign,\" the message read. \"well, we wish that was true -- but in many cases it wasn't. don't get me wrong: we're very grateful for any support you give the campaign. this was simply a computer mistake.\"i hope you can forgive, or at least overlook, this glitch, and consider the essence of the message, which is: we need your help.\"later, segal said the mistake was a matter of attempting to cover too much ground at once.\"we were doing three mailings at once and the wrong message got queued up with the wrong distribution instruction,\" he said. \"how many times have you hit the [send] button and wished you hadn't?\"segal found out about the glitch after a few of forbes' key staffers revealed in a morning conference call that \"they'd all gotten erroneous messages\" -- a telltale sign that forbes' own team members hadn't contributed the legal maximum to their boss, either.segal said the mistake was one of the hazards of waging a web-based campaign. \"what email has done to strengthen the campaign so far outweighs the occasional glitch,\" he said, citing the us$40,000 the campaign has raised over the net thus far.\"perhaps we were subconsciously engaged in such wishful thinking.\"then there's the bradley campaign, which is very consciously waging an aggressive email strategy with the media.\"when we saw [gore's] ad script we noted how similar the thrust of the language was to what bradley has been saying for months and months,\" bradley's hauser said.the email takes transcribed excepts from the gore commercials and compares them to similar statements made by bradley in previous speeches.according to the email, gore's transcript reads: \"i think it's just unconscionable at a time when we have the strongest economy in history -- we're the wealthiest nation on earth -- to have millions and millions of children who have no health care coverage at all. we ought to change that.\"then bradley compared his own words from a speech given on 28 october: \"i think that we are at a time in our nation's history when 45 million people don't have any health insurance \u2013 1 million more this year than last year \u2013 this time of unprecedented prosperity. and if we can't do something about this now, when can we do something about it?\"\"does this sound familiar?\" the email points out after citing both gore's and bradley's stance on health care for children.the message goes on to criticize gore's health care plan, citing statistics on health care and poverty during the vice president's term in office.\"gore's health care plan will not guarantee health care for all children,\" the email says. \"the gore plan leaves the health care for america's children at the mercy of an uneven patchwork of eligibility, coverage and benefits based on where they live.\"gore officials scoffed at the idea of campaign plagiarism. \"bradley has offered a health care plan that just doesn't work,\" said chris lehane, gore's press secretary. \"and now in a desperate attempt to revive himself, he's launching a negative e-politics attack.... he was responding to our email.\"editor's note: this story has been changed since its original publication to clarify that the bradley and gore emails were sent to the media only. wired news regrets any confusion."}
