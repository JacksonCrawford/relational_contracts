(girl brothers/world domination)now that partying like it's 1999 is no longer abstract, former prince and the revolution anchorwomen wendy and lisa are back with a mature, natural image and a self-released full-length to complement it. the girls' effort alternates between earthy, guitar-led pieces and songs with hints of soulful electro that characterize the early '80s minneapolis funk scene that birthed them.xtcapple venus volume 1 (idea/tvt records)the first few listens to volume i will not prepare you for the deep affection this record inspires. andy partridge's softhearted \"river of orchids\" and \"i can't own her\" counter his bitter ballad to his ex-wife, \"your dictionary.\" colin moulding brilliantly embraces silly; his ode to the gardening fool of \"fruit nut\" unfolds: \"some people say / that i am out of my tree / just a strawberry fool. / someday they'll see / 'til then i'll blow you a raspberry / 'coz apples and pears are me / so i'm tending my fruit / ah you've got to have a hobby / a man must have a shed to keep him sane.\" either that, or a dose of xtc every few years.thomas quasthoffschubert: winterreise (rca)when i heard bass-baritone thomas quasthoff on the radio, i was so captivated that i waited in my parked car until the announcer identified the vocalist. i had to have this recording! i couldn't resist the artist's velvety voice and brilliant musicianship. his interpretation of schubert's tragic take on unrequited love is pure genius.wilcosummer teeth (reprise)if you're expecting the neocountry wilco whose collaboration with billy bragg featured woody guthrie's long-hidden lyrics, hold your horses. while 1996's being there introduced power pop to the band's no depression mix, summer teeth reverses the order, throwing country-rock flourishes into catchy brit-pop collages.summer teeth is full of verse about complicated, inconstant love - in all its tormented forms - wed to deceptively pretty tunes. on \"she's a jar\" frontman jeff tweedy shares that \"she begs me not to hit her.\" elsewhere, he sings, \"i dreamed about killing you again last night / and it felt alright to me.\" geez. considering the dark side it conjures, no wonder he's \"worried i'm always in love.\"street credjoystick to the cosmosmacsimum overdrivecritical massvid kid with big-screen aspirationsthe web's executive assistantfeed your headsatellites can waitkidcammusicjust outta betareadmethe name gamehands-free home accessout of africamutant killing spreelarger than lifecontributors"}
