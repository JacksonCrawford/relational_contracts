organic chemistry. will online courses provide a more democratic classroom or keep students in the back of the class? by kendra mayfield.", "author": "kendra mayfield", "category": "culture", "type":

microbiology, all courses that her local high school doesn't offer. her coursework at virtual high school will allow her to graduate a year earlier than most of her classmates at john f. kennedy high school in fremont, california.a growing number of distance learning ventures across the united states are offering high school credit for online courses, expanding students' access and opportunities beyond traditional classrooms.\"a virtual any time, any place learning experience provides a great opportunity for students to learn at their own pace and direction,\" said john blair, president and ceo of class.com, a commercial spin-off of the university of nebraska that provides virtual courses to high schools.kentucky governor paul patton recently announced a deal with class.com to sell online courses to every high school in the state. beginning in january, the kentucky virtual high school will help boost small, rural schools that cannot attract upper-level math, science, and foreign-language teachers.with virtual enrollment, schools that lack funds and resources can extend course offerings and provide alternative methods of learning to students with special needs.the virtual high school, a collaborative of national high schools that is financed by a five-year, us$7.8 million department of education technology challenge grant, offers participating schools netcourses in exchange for teaching time. students can explore nontraditional courses from music appreciation to aeronautics, classes that could not otherwise be offered because of low enrollment.\"you won't find a class like 'scientific and religious perspectives on intelligence' being taught in a regular high school, but here we're given the opportunity,\" cho said.the virtual environment encourages different learning styles. without in-class teachers, students become self-directed, independent learners. this can give some students better opportunities to learn.students who might not otherwise participate in traditional classrooms can engage in email threads and discussions that transcend communication differences.enrolling in a virtual high school class has allowed kimberly leigh clapp, who attends an all-deaf school in maryland, to participate in class discussions without an interpreter.\"i've never gotten the chance to learn alongside hearing peers until virtual high school came along,\" she said via email. asynchronous, rolling discussions provide a more democratic classroom, said virtual high school director bruce droste. without front-row students dominating conversation, students who are afraid to take risks in front of peers can easily contribute.in the virtual environment, \"students can't sit in the back row and be quiet,\" he said.flexible, around-the-clock course schedules allow low-income students with full-time jobs to take classes they might not otherwise attend. virtual courses could also eliminate so-called age-grading by allowing students who want to finish their high school diploma to participate.one of the greatest challenges that distance-learners encounter is trying to establish teacher relationships without face-to-face contact. student-teacher interaction across different time zones can be difficult.time management is another challenge. students must keep track of their schedules and course requirements, balancing weekly virtual courseloads with daily in-class assignments. so a certain amount of self-discipline is necessary.with a growing number of online courses requiring time-intensive teaching, distance learning has raised quality concerns among educators.the national education association has established criteria to ensure that distance education teachers are qualified, that student/faculty ratios are set, and that courses are fully accredited.\"the bottom line is to make certain that students are learning and achieving,\" said barbara stein, nea senior policy analyst.the major problems in implementing online courses have been technological, droste said. schools providing computer access must deal with system crashes and program glitches.despite these challenges, online educators say that some students who do not succeed in the classroom can excel in the virtual environment. droste said some students claim to know their virtual high school teachers better than their in-class teachers.\"students i've known in my virtual classes have seemed more thoughtful, more interested than students in my regular classes,\" said cho. \"they want to be there.\"many virtual high schools are extending their reach to adult learners, home schooling students, and international students. virtual courses allow students to communicate with a diverse community of peers, providing real-world lessons for students to continue in college and beyond."}
