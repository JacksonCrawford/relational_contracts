pool their efforts. and that could bring a complete genome map as early as next year. by kristen philipkoski.", "author": "kristen philipkoski", "category": "science", "type": "article", "timestamp": "11.16.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "the leading private contender to identifying the entire human genetic makeup was on the verge of collaborating with a similarly motivated rival public consortium before talks broke down a year ago. but a spokesman for celera, a company that has filed for 6,500 patents on gene discoveries, said monday that talks could be rekindled in the future.if the human genome project joins forces with celera, the genetic map could be completed as early as next year, celera spokesman paul gilman said.\"there have been serious attempts at collaborating in the past. the department of energy and celera had an agreement drafted and were prepared to sign full-fledged scientific collaboration back in december [of last year],\" celera spokesman paul gilman said. \"that was stopped -- there was significant pressure from the department of energy to shelve effort.\"once the genome is complete -- when all three billion units of dna are located and mapped -- researchers can conceivably use the information to develop genetic diagnosis and therapy.celera is about a third of the way toward completing the map -- well ahead in the race to map the genome based on what it claims is superior technology and strategy. but the human genome project (hgp) has questioned the ultimate accuracy of celera's map. celera has insisted its final product will be even more precise than the consortium's.celera also has a major advantage in the race because the hgp regularly divulges its discoveries -- which celera is able to use in its research. but celera sells its findings on a subscription basis to genome researchers, a practice for which it has been strongly criticized.regardless, the fact the two sides have discussed a collaboration at all indicates they both believe a genome map could be completed more quickly by working together.\"if there were a collaboration, our deadline for a completed genome by the end of 2001, and the public project's [prediction for a final draft] in 2003, would probably both become 2000,\" gilman said.gilman said talks between celera and the consortium began as early as december 1998, but the consortium -- which strongly believes that gene discoveries should remain in the public domain -- balked at the terms of the contract, effectively ending the dialog.\"we continue to remain open to [a collaboration] and think it could be productive, but at this moment there are no formal discussions,\" gilman said.one possible reason for the breakdown in negotiations is celera's long-standing insistence that it acquire patents on its gene discoveries.celera has been criticized extensively for wanting to patent genes -- which many researchers believe should remain in the public domain -- but the company stands by its business plan.\"we understand that when you patent something, you're required to disclose it, and patenting is a way to disclose without fear of losing the value of the discovery,\" gilman said.\"the idea that because we want to patent because we're unwilling to make things public is kind of the reverse of the way the logic should follow,\" he added.the national human genome research institute (nhgri) did not return repeated phone calls.in october, lee hood, a genomics researcher at the university of washington in seattle, wrote in nature that the public consortium's random approach to mapping the human genome could become prohibitively expensive toward the end of the project.hood suggested two weeks ago that the consortium switch to a more ordered approach.since a working draft of 90 percent of the genome is expected from the public consortium next spring, there's no time to change the strategy now, hood said. but \"for future study that should happen,\" he said.celera's uses a \"shotgun\" approach, which sequences bits of genes that will be pieced together in the end to create the map.\"the simplest way to put it is it forgoes what is a fairly [time-consuming] mapping stage at the front end of the project, which the nhgri does, and instead uses a heavily computational process at the backend,\" gilman said. \"sequencers are important, but so are computers.\"roy whitfield, ceo of incyte, a genomics company in palo alto, california, defended the nhgri's method.\"the human genome project announced about four months ago that they'll have a first draft by the middle of next year, and we've seen all the data pouring out of the human genome project at about 10 times the rate it was before,\" whitfield said. \"they're right on track and doing a great job.\"collaborating with celera is \"not consistent with my understanding of the human genome project,\" whitfield said."}
