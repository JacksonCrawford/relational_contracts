lots of attention. and it's got a secret weapon in boris becker. steve kettmann reports from berlin.", "author": "steve kettmann", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "12.10.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "berlin -- just a few months into its low-cost internet access experiment, aol germany's bid to make a major splash appears to have been a bellyflop. that immediate perception may be deceiving, however.in late august, when aol germany announced its price-cutting scheme to great fanfare at a berlin trade show, the company clearly intended to make immediate and dramatic inroads on the german market-leader t-online.\"we are willing to be aggressive,\" andreas schmidt, aol europe's ceo, said at the time. \"i think we can take over the leadership in germany.\"two months after aol's monthly flat rate of dm9.90 went into effect, on 1 october, the number of people using its service has only gone from 900,000 to one million, based on the numbers aol is willing to release.\"it's hard for us,\" said one aol germany employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \"the t-online commercials are just too good,\"t-online claimed a reach in germany of 67.9 percent, compared to 29.1 percent for aol, in numbers compiled for the month of october by the research outfit mmxi europe, an off-shoot of media metrix.but executives at aol germany remain confident their business plan will work out beautifully. and they may understand the evolution of the internet better than their critics: making money is not just about getting people to use your service -- it's about getting them to give you money.\"[the price of a phone call] basically isn't an issue any more,\" said uwe heddendorp, managing director of aol germany. \"for the first time [in germany] we have an aol bill that includes both the flat rate and the local phone calls. the flat rate is very low and the local phone call is up to 51 percent lower than the normal local phone rate.\"so even if subscribers are not paying anything to access t-online, they are paying more to make the phone call. it's a huge factor in europe, where minute-to-minute tolls on local calls are standard. for instance, even a reporter making frequent -- and often lengthy -- calls from germany to north america pays less in a month for long-distance charges than for accessing the internet.\"we charge 3.9 pfennigs a minute around the clock, compared to local rates of up to 9 pfennigs a minute during the day,\" said heddendorp. \"we provide our users with reduced local phone rates by buying time at a bulk rate, and we've seen dramatic increase in the amount of time people spend online.\"eventually, then, aol germany hopes to keep people online significantly longer, and as a result make money by selling them products -- or showing them advertisements. \"that's really the key to e-commerce,\" said aol spokesman alexander adler. \"what we definitely get is e-commerce and ad sales revenue.\"the trick is to convince germans that aol isn't expensive and isn't complicated. toward that end, they have tennis legend boris becker in a commercial that has generated at least as much attention as aol executives could have hoped.in the aol spots, becker talks about how his wife has been an aol subscriber for years, but that he worries it's too difficult. then he tries and sees the light.\"you have every late-night show picking up the theme,\" said philip schindler, aol germany's head of marketing. \"you have comics making fun of it in a positive way. and the interesting thing is the advertisement doesn't come out of an agency. the scene actually happened when we saw boris for the first time. we just repeated the scene. he came into the room and said, 'well my wife has been on aol for several years, and she says i should do this too, but i'm not a tech person.'\"\"the response to the commercials is the most overwhelming thing i've seen,\" insisted schindler. \"there is not a single person in germany that does not know the ad.\"\"in german you don't say, 'i go on to the internet,' you say, 'i go into the internet.' boris says something like, 'i'm already in, this is easy.' even the german chancellor, gerhard schroeder, used this recently, 'ich bin drinnen.'\"the ad hits its mark because becker is familiar to germans and far too wealthy to have to fake enthusiasm for aol. if he's willing to get behind it, then many germans are going to think it's worth investigating.schindler insisted the number of people using aol in germany has \"skyrocketed,\" but he would not release numbers and neither would heddendorp, the managing director.whether aol's business plan is to bluff through a difficult early patch in the experiment or wait to cross some magical threshold, the company's future still faces widespread skepticism in europe internet circles.is partner bertelsmann ag, the german media giant, just biding its time, and learning about a future rival? can aol establish a european identity even though it's deeply identified with america?\"what is aol going to do to compete with the local players?\" wondered one tech executive in europe who spoke on background. \"the europeans are not stupid and they learn fast. i wonder if bertelsmann didn't get more out of their partnership with aol by learning about the internet and might be ready to go on without aol.\"too early to tell. but if confidence is contagious, heddendorp and aol germany could be in good shape.\"we're no. 3 in germany in terms of reach but in terms of usage we outperform all our competitors,\" he said. \"there are portals that have a lot of traffic, but people spend less time there. we're working on our content. we have relaunched some channels -- for example, our finance channel, offering almost real time stock quotes. we are relaunching our sports site. we will be introducing new channels next year on broader themes like kids, family, cars. we're relaunching our home page in december basically as a new portal.\"we are going to advertise that more now that it's a really cool portal. the commercials with boris becker have been tremendous. our brand recognition has risen substantially. it has a phenomenal feedback in the media.\""}
