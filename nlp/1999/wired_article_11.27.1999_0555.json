different approach. while others have argued that microsoft should be split along product lines \u2013 or, at the very least, between operating systems and applications \u2013 ellison wants the company literally cloned twice, to create three equal copies.also:ms focus bound to changeclosing the windows on msjudge jackson: linux won't lastjudge: 'gates was main culprit'who thinks what about thatus v. microsoft: timelinejudge jackson's findings of factongoing us v. microsoft coveragehe argued that splitting along product lines would create three new monopolies \u2013 kind of like cutting up a science-fiction monster in half and watching it grow back into more monsters. so instead, at last week's oracle openworld 99 annual user conference in los angeles, ellison proposed three microsofts, each offering the entire product line, from windows 2000 to age of empires.one clone is for bill, one for steve ballmer, and one for paul allen, who hasn't been actively involved with microsoft for 15 years. they'd have to compete with one another for the market.so larry, let's say there is a santa claus. it's 2003, three years after larry got his wish: three baby bills.2003 -\u2013 crumbling empiresthe splintering of microsoft proved irrelevant over time, because the pc was no longer the dominant method of accessing the internet. it wasn't the palmpilot family and it wasn't the network computer, although they came close. the pc market was blind-sided by sony, nintendo, and sega, which produced consoles with such power they totally blew away pcs. it started with the sega dreamcast in 1999 and got even more pronounced with playstation ii and nintendo n128, formerly the dolphin, in 2000.by 2003, all three companies have issued new consoles using high-speed chips from fujitsu, hitachi, and mips that wiped the floor with intel's itanium family and even out-performed compaq's alpha. all three consoles came with 100 megabit ethernet ports for connecting to dsl and cable modem ports, which cover 90 percent of the united states by this point. game consoles came with keyboards and mice, and parents buying these us$200 consoles for their kids realized these units were perfect for internet access.with these powerful consoles, the internet started to look like the computers in star trek, something pcs couldn't approach. adults ended up fighting with their kids for time on the nintendo. the pc slowly lost its importance. it's still used for serious applications, though. even corel resisted the urge to port wordperfect to nintendo, and intuit balked at porting quicken to playstation iii. but the console market has taken a lot of the fire out of the pc in the internet market.in the end, all three microsoft companies actually shrunk as the pc became less relevant to the mass market and became more dedicated it-oriented companies, with less and less consumer software. this did little to remedy the real problems caused by microsoft, since it departments were far more frustrated with microsoft than the average consumer ever was.when microsoft was split, gates and ballmer had a good laugh between themselves. the two former partners in business and crime for the last 20 years came to an agreement. they'd pretend to compete with each other, but in reality, it would be more of a good cop/bad cop agreement.neither one produced radically different products, so the either/or choice wasn't much of a choice. not even two years after the split, original equipment manufacturers were already complaining to the doj \u2013 but with george w. bush in the white house, the complaints fell on deaf ears.then a funny thing happened. it started slowly, in minor incidents, but gates and ballmer began to snipe at each other. gates stole some prized employees from ballmer, ballmer retaliated by getting wind of a planned acquisition by gates and swooped in, picking up the company in a better deal.then came sweetheart deals to oems, in an attempt to keep oems quiet and one-up each other. watching gates and ballmer compete soon became a popular spectator sport in the industry.eventually, gates and ballmer's microsofts were indeed competing with each other, and it finally blew up at comdex. the two introduced two totally contradictory operating system strategies while dismissing the other's plan, and the roar of laughter was deafening.paul allen added to the stress. there's nothing like confronting one's own mortality to put things in perspective, and he proved far easier to work with and nowhere near as aggressive or abrasive as gates and ballmer. slowly, word got out that he was the real alternative, and in time, he became the partner of choice for most pc companies.in the end, allen indirectly forced gates and ballmer to be more competitive. you want an operating system without a browser? ok, just don't make a lot of noise about it. you want the multiple document interface back in word? no problem.but pcs weren't in allen's cards, broadband was. he viewed his microsoft clone as a component to a bigger picture and an important element of charter communications: his cable investments. allen, who purchased zdtv soon after the original microsoft was ruled a monopoly, began a broadband push that gates and ballmer couldn't match.in the end, the three companies were all diminished somewhat because the demand for windows and office remained largely the same, but the supply had tripled. this left the three microsofts financially weaker. allen ended up the most successful financially because he was viewed in the most positive light by partners and the market.and one of the original three lived happily ever after."}
