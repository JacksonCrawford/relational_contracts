fast. __ moore's law should have a corollary. call it the rule of obsolescence: as computers gain speed, history cycles faster.the best place in the world to absorb this is the computer museum history center, a huge private collection of 20th-century technology - analog computers, supercomputers, minicomputers, workstations, pcs and pc prototypes, miles of wiring, punchcard readers, paper tape rolls, yellowed manuals, keyboards, mouses, and monitors. the museum resides in a couple of cavernous old warehouses on the grounds of the nasa ames research center at moffett field, 35 miles south of san francisco. covering 25,000 square feet of floor space are roughly 3,000 hardware artifacts, among them some of the pivotal inventions of the computer age: the university of pennsylvania's eniac, the xerox alto, and the apple i.this is geek valhalla, where big computers go after they die, joined soon enough by little machines whose day is done. it's a place where the aura of vacuum tubes and mainframes can be experienced firsthand, and where context - cultural, scientific, political - is as important as content. it's where commercial catastrophes, what the curators call \"noble failures,\" are revered and celebrated alongside revolutionary successes, and where marshall mcluhan's famous line - \"we shape tools and they in turn shape us\" - is rendered in 3-d.established in 1996 with backing from gordon bell (former vp of research and development at digital equipment corporation) and len shustek (cofounder of network general), the computer museum history center (www.computerhistory.org) is now looking to upgrade. it's in the midst of a $40 million fund-raising effort, with the money earmarked to build a modern space that can house everything under one roof. until then, you have to get a little dusty to see it. the museum is open to the public one day a week, by appointment only, no charge. your curator is dag spicer, who holes up in a double-wide trailer a half-mile down the road from the warehouses.a postmodern historian with advanced degrees in the history and philosophy of science, spicer believes his storehouses of dead technology will always have something to tell us. \"we don't want these huge slabs of iron to be mute objects,\" he says, flipping through an old issue of datamation, an early computer magazine that ran surreal advertisements of mainframes straddled by pinup girls. \"we want to explain how they fit into the time scale for the history of computing - which is only 50 years. aspects of how we got from there to here are extremely important.\"__ during the 11 years eniac was online, it did more arithmetic than the entire human race had done up to 1945. __\"for all the academic disembodied knowledge that computers represent,\" adds spicer, \"they're intensely human.\"__ enigma __chiffriermaschinen aktien-gesellschaft (cipher machines stock corporation)1923$150 encryptiongerman soldiers issued an enigma were to make no mistake about their orders if captured: shoot it or throw it overboard.based on electronic typewriters invented in the 1920s, the infamous enigma encryption machines of world war ii were controlled by wheels set with the code du jour. each letter typed would illuminate the appropriate character to send in the coded message.in 1940, building on work by polish code breakers, alan turing and his colleagues at the famed uk cryptography center bletchley park devised the bombe, a mechanical computer that deciphered enigma-encoded messages. even as the nazis beefed up the enigma architecture by adding more wheels, the codes could be cracked at the naval security station in washington, dc - giving the allies the upper hand in the battle of the atlantic. the fact that the allies had cracked the enigma code was not officially confirmed until the 1970s.__ eniac __university of pennsylvania1946$486,800military firing-table calculation, atomic-weapons designin 1943, the us military commissioned university of pennsylvania professor john mauchly to develop a digital \"electronic numerical integrator and computer\" (eniac) to calculate firing tables, which gunners used to aim artillery. the 3,000 trajectories a gun battery required had previously been generated by women known as \"computers\" working on mechanical desktop calculators. but the work was slow. based on a half-dozen variables like shell weight, propellant charge, and air resistance, one trajectory took up to 40 hours for a human computer to calculate.this first general-purpose electronic digital computer wasn't completed until february 1946, months after the war ended. but eniac would have worked wonders - its 18,000 vacuum tubes calculated a trajectory in the time it takes a shell to reach its target. again, women programmed the machine by plugging in different combinations of patch cables for each application.with the war over, eniac went on to make h-bomb calculations, assist in wind-tunnel design, and attempt to predict the weather. turning eniac off was frowned upon, as the thermal stress of cycling the machine burned out several vacuum tubes every time the switch was flipped.eniac was operational for 11 years, and during that time it performed more arithmetic than the entire human race had done up to 1945. in celebration of eniac's 50th birthday, computer scientists at penn easily simulated eniac's entire circuitry on a thumbnail-sized microchip.__ pdp-1 __digital equipment corporation1959$120,000general scientific and research applicationsmarketed in 1959 as an interactive computer, with its cathode-ray tube, light pen, modified ibm typewriter, \"real time\" processing power, and multiuser capabilities, digital equipment corporation's pdp-1 encouraged play. with 24-hour access to the pdp-1, a group of mit staff and former students, including wayne witanen, j. martin graetz, peter samson, dan edwards, and stephen \"slug\" russell, dedicated themselves to creating an ideal demo program for the computer, which was donated by dec founder ken olsen.inspired by e. e. \"doc\" smith's skylark and lensman science fiction novels, the group conceived what was arguably the first videogame. spacewar! consisted of two spaceships firing on each other as they zoomed through constellations of dots on the crt. panel switches on the pdp-1 served as the operation controls until hackers, now proliferating around the project, fashioned wood-and-bakelite \"gamepads.\"after being ported as freeware to university computers around the globe, spacewar! was finally marketed to the masses in 1971 by nutting associates as a stand-alone arcade game called computer space. nolan bushnell licensed the game, a financial flop, before founding atari.in 1987, the 25th anniversary of spacewar!, a pdp-1 was reactivated by a group of the original programmers eager to play with their old toy and challenge a new generation of screenagers to a match.\"spacewar! itself has bred a race of noisy, garishly colored monsters that lurk in dark caverns and infest pizza parlors, eating quarters and offering degenerate pleasures,\" graetz wrote in creative computing magazine in 1981. \"i think i know a few former hackers who aren't the slightest bit surprised.\"__ \"the fastest way to succeed is to double your failure rate.\" - thomas j. watson sr., founder of ibm ____ ten fifty __hybrid computers like the ten fifty, manufactured by computer products in the early 1960s, combined the high-speed capability of analog computers with new digital technology. the plug board was used to \"program\" the computer by patching various logic components together.the hybrids were often employed in factories, oil refineries, power companies, and chemical laboratories, where sensors provided analog data that could be input as voltages and later manipulated in the digital side of the machine.according to john gingrich, a sales manager from 1960 to 1970 at hybrid-computer manufacturer electronic associates, their multimillion-dollar digital-analog machines were also employed in training and simulation exercises for the newest attack helicopters, lockheed's l1011, and boeing's sst and 747.__ johniac __rand corporation1953$300,000geometry calculations, payroll applicationsa mathematical workhorse built at santa monica, california-based rand, the johnniac - named for mathematician john von neumann, who did many of the early calculations for its design - was the only computer at the time to use selectron memory. each of the 80 glistening selectron vacuum tubes held 256 bits of data and cost rca $500 to manufacture. (hence, selectron memory was quickly replaced by core memory, a matrix of tiny iron-oxide rings representing 1s or 0s, depending on the direction of magnetization.)with its sleek metal cabinetry and glass doors, johnniac resembles a massive refrigerator, which it was. air-conditioning equipment installed on the building floor below the johnniac piped cool air over the vacuum tubes to keep the machine from overheating.shortly after the johnniac's 1953 christening, von neumann modestly protested the choice of the name to john williams, head mathematician at rand. williams' reply: \"[a rand engineer] has relayed your blushing disavowals regarding the appropriateness of the term 'johnniac.' in this matter your view just represents dispersion. if it helps any, recall that there are lots of johns in the world.\"anticipating deep blue, rand coders developed a chess program for johnniac that attempted to mimic the style of human grand masters. each move took up to one hour to compute.__ philco 2000 model 212 __philco1962$6 millionaircraft and missile tracking, atomic-energy applicationsmanufactured by the company best remembered for its classic home-radio sets, the philco 2000 line was a favorite number cruncher of energy facilities like westinghouse electric's bettis atomic power laboratory and general electric's knolls atomic power lab. but the 212's biggest fans were perhaps the defense departments of the us and israel, which used their big iron to keep a watchful eye on air and space traffic.indeed, norad installed three 212s deep inside cheyenne mountain, the legendary chunk of colo-rado rock that houses the us combat-operations center. (see \"going ballistic!.\") there, the machines hummed until 1980, when norad finally upgraded to more modern honeywell computers. the 16-year-old toilers simply couldn't keep up with new detection technologies that had better communications devices and longer memories.__ 7030 \"stretch\" __ibm1961$7.8 millionatomic-weapons design, weather forecastingthe ibm 7030 project (aka stretch) was initiated in 1955 with the goal of building a supercomputer 100 times faster than any other machine. \"stretching\" engineering and computer architecture, the 7030 was ibm's first major product that replaced vacuum tubes with transistors. also groundbreaking was its ability to pipeline (execute multiple instructions in different parts of the system), look-ahead (decode instructions before they are needed), multiprogram (basically, multitask), and automatically detect and correct errors.the myriad lights showed the status of every bit in the machine, a monitoring system not possible today because processor speeds would keep bulbs glowing continuously. still, operators commonly questioned whether a darkened bulb represented a 0 or a burnout.the first stretch, delivered to what was then called the los alamos scientific laboratory - home to the a-bomb and the h-bomb - was only 25 to 50 times faster than its predecessors, forcing big blue to drop the price of the computer to $7.8 million from its original list of $13.5 million. a commercial failure, stretch was an embarrassment to ceo thomas j. watson jr., who angrily banished project head stephen dunwell to research duties in the far less glamorous area of computer-aided instruction.after many stretch innovations showed up later in successful ibm computers (and those of competitors), watson apologized, in his own stilted way, by honoring dunwell with the title of ibm fellow a decade later. the machine - the very unit that went to los alamos - is serial number 1 of eight produced. all models were sold to government agencies, including the national weather service, which put stretch to work tracking storms, and the national security agency, which used a modified 7030 known as \"harvest\" for code-breaking calculations.__ sage __1958$5 billionaircraft detection and trackingibm's massive sage (semi-automatic ground environment) system for air-defense radar processing helped calm '50s societal hysteria over the possibility of a renegade russian bomber. a replacement for the grease-pencil plotting of radar blips - far too slow to be effective against supersonic planes - sage kept vigil for red nukes screaming over the north pole. yet it was fooled more than once, says computer museum curator dag spicer, by flocks of birds soaring above newfoundland.during its design, some 7,000 programmers had their hands on sage. by 1963, the system had evolved into 23 windowless blast-resistant centers around north america, each with a 250-ton computer powered by 49,000 vacuum tubes. via modem, the machines spoke to one another, to ground and shipboard radar, and to weather stations, and kept tabs on legit air traffic.operators stationed in blue-lit rooms interacted with their screens using light guns. judging by the messages penciled on the backs of removable knobs on the pictured model - \"get me out of here!\" and \"i want a pizza!\"- the work was tedious. energy boosts came from cigarettes, ignited from lighters built into the console, and snuffed out into onboard ashtrays. rare moments of intensity were quickly quelled, recounts spicer, once it was determined that \"attacks\" were simulations generated by training tapes accidentally left playing.by the time the $5 billion sage system was fully deployed, it was obsolete, no match for the speed of new icbms. but the technology led to sabre, the airline reservation system still in use today.__ \"it had a screen that could do a reasonable job of behaving like a piece of paper.\" - butler lampson, codesigner of the alto at xerox parc ____ cdc6600 __control data corporation19647 millionweapons design, weather forecastingthe cdc6600, running at 3 million instructions per second, remained the fastest machine in the world for five years after its birth. more than one hundred units were manufactured at cray's lab in rural chippewa falls, wisconsin, and sold at $7 million apiece. this model, serial number 1, was bought by lawrence livermore national laboratories for atomic-weapons design.to build the cdc6600, 2 miles of wiring were cut into specific lengths and embroidery experts painstakingly wove the wires onto mats (pictured on pages 276-277) comparable to today's integrated-circuit boards. excess wiring between two points was often necessary to slow electricity to a speed manageable by the computer's other components.the 20,000-pound monster was packed with 350,000 transistors. the quickest way for technicians to locate a malfunctioning component, says spicer, was to run their hands across the body of the machine, feeling for hot spots.dual monitors enabled the operator to run programs on one screen while simultaneously checking the machine's health on the other. the innovative display also enabled punch-drunk programmers at lawrence livermore to code a pair of moving eyes for the two monitors - perhaps an inspiration for today's screensavers.__ pdp-8 __digital equipment corporation1965$18,000process control, data aggregationreleased in 1965, digital equipment corporation's classic pdp-8 line is often credited with being the world's first true minicomputer. the $18,000 blue plexiglas cabinet was small enough to sit on a lab bench. advertisements marketing its small size - a mere 34 by 21 by 21 inches - depicted the machine in the backseat of a convertible volkswagen beetle.two money-saving innovations enabled the pdp-8 to be priced within the discretionary budgets of most university department heads and managers in a wide range of industrial factories. easily swappable modular flip chips (pictured on page 278) containing several logic gates (electronic switches) kept costs down, as did automated wire-wrapping - previously the work of embroidery experts. in addition to automating assembly-line coordination, the pdp-8 aggregated data before sending it to a mainframe computer.__ alto __xerox parc1973$12,000__word processing, point-and-click gui programs __the alto starred in one of the desktop era's quintessential creation dramas: the insanely great idea that got away. in 1979, three years after the debut of the apple i, steve jobs' hot start-up was in its final round of private financing before going public, wrote michael hiltzik in his recent book on xerox parc, dealers of lightning. xerox wanted in on the $7 million deal. jobs had a deep distrust of big business, but he was swayed by colleagues who had seen the amazing research going on at xerox parc, where engineers - working under the alto's chief architect, chuck thacker - were thinking different. so they cut a deal: xerox would get 100,000 shares of apple stock, and jobs would be invited to visit parc.jobs was blown away when he saw the alto. its physical similarities to the mac are obvious: the alto had a mouse, a full single-page display, and ethernet links. but the machine's most groundbreaking innovation was alan kay and dan ingall's smalltalk, a point-and-click windows gui that was the forerunner of today's standard operating systems.in one of the most infamous business blunders in silicon valley history, xerox waited until 1981 to market the alto, in the form of the grossly overpriced $16,000 star. meanwhile, jobs had picked up the user-friendly paradigm and taken off running. the apple lisa and the macintosh hit the market in 1983 and 1984, and then it was bill gates' turn to appropriate a few innovations. the mac begat windows, but they both owe a debt to the alto.__ illiac iv __burroughs corporation1974$31 million__satellite support, image processing __designed under an arpa contract at the university of illinois and manufactured by the burroughs corporation, illiac (illinois automatic computer) was first envisioned by designer daniel slotnick, a disciple of john von neumann, as a massively parallel supercomputer with 256 processing units (pus).by the time it was operational, the most massive thing about it was the price - $31 million, three times the initial budget. while the illiac iv was the first supercomputer to use semiconductor memory, it maxed out at only 64 pus for parallel calculations.the ambitious illiac iv (the fourth in a series designed by the university, beginning in 1952) is the supreme example of unplanned obsolescence. while the machine was being built, its technology was continuously surpassed by advances in integrated circuitry. this irked engineers because it was impractical to change the entire architecture every time another breakthrough was announced.after antiwar protesters tried to firebomb the university of illinois computer center in 1970, the 11,000-square-foot illiac iv was moved to nasa ames. housed in a wing built especially for it, the illiac cranked away on problems in fluid dynamics, satellite support, image processing, and climate modeling.the massive platters (pictured on page 295) are hard disks: each 3-foot-by-1-inch piece of magnetic media weighed 30 pounds and stored 10 mbytes of data.__ altair 8800 __micro instrumentation and telemetry systems1975$397__various applications using basic programming __launched with a hype-filled cover story in the january 1975 issue of popular electronics, the altair 8800 was an early microcomputer sold as a kit - common practice in the hobbyist-computer industry. manufactured by micro instrumentation and telemetry systems (mits), the 8800 included an intel 8080 cpu with 256 bytes of ram. bill gates, then a harvard student, was so inspired by the altair 8800 that he wrote a version of the basic programming language for the machine. mits licensed the code from gates and partner paul allen and, shortly thereafter, microsoft was born.__ notetaker __xerox parc1978$500,000__smalltalk-78 applications, including word processing __bigger than a briefcase and smaller than a suitcase, the notetaker was the cro-magnon of laptops, the first pc to be used on an airplane by business travelers. prototyped at xerox parc in 1978, the notetaker was an offshoot of xerox parc engineer alan kay's still-unrealized vision for his dynabook, a powerful computer small enough to be toted around under the user's arm and simple enough for a child to operate.hardware designer doug fairbairn tricked out the notetaker with a tiny screen, a mouse, and a 5.25-inch floppy drive. smalltalk-78, a version of which appeared on the alto, was the notetaker's gui. but like the osborne i and other early-'80s \"luggables\" that boldly ripped off the notetaker's form factor, the portability of the 48-pound computer was in the eye (or arm) of the beholder.__ \"all of us who were connected with computers lusted after them. to have a computer was better than sex.\" - ed roberts, inventor of the altair 8800 ____ apple i __apple computer1976$666__hobbyist computing __the two-guys-in-a-garage pioneer spirit all started here. the apple i, soldered together in cupertino by steve wozniak and steve jobs, was sold for $666 as a basic-compatible kit with the cpu, the video terminal, and memory on a single circuit board. locating a keyboard was up to the builder, who also had to hook up a standard tv as a monitor, while an optional $40 cassette interface converted a tape deck into a removable media storage device.the initial order, for 50 of the 220 units manufactured in the first production run, came from the byte shop computer store in nearby palo alto. the apple i marketing campaign featured an illustration of isaac newton sitting under an apple tree, with the william wordsworth quote: \"newton ... a mind forever voyaging through strange seas of thought ... alone.\" when the apple ii was launched in 1977, the company accepted trade-ins of the original machine. as a result, collectors didn't hang on to old units, leaving only 50 or so apple is intact today."}
