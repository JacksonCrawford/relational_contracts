the breakthrough cg imagery and facial animation systems created for jurassic park and dragonheart; the orchestration software refined to manipulate whole platoons of photorealistic characters at once - like the masses of military droids in the phantom menace's climactic ground battle. that's not even counting the seamless cut-and-paste tricks he can do with live action. ____ after two decades of mounting anticipation, two years of preproduction, and two years of post, with a scant 65 days of traditional on-set photography and some 2,000 digitally altered shots, star wars: episode 1 - the phantom menace is both ground-breaking and history-making. and lucas sounds like he's just getting started. __wired: what was it like being back in the director's chair after 20 years?lucas: it's way beyond anything i imagined possible; it's like the invention of sound or color. i don't know what the next revolution will be, nor do i really care. i am finally free to tell the kinds of stories i want to tell.so, total creative freedom?well, before, you had few options - cut here, cut there. now the huge amount of freedom ultimately demands a lot more discipline. once you've learned the ropes, you don't spend a lot of time playing around. you know what you want and you go for it.how much of this film was created in the computer?ninety-five percent. there are only 200 shots we didn't alter digitally, and we're running them through the computer anyway to have an all-digital master.two years ago you said by now you'd be able to make an all-digital film with no film.well, this was shot on film - or some of it was. we intercut digital photography, and i don't think anybody will be able to tell which is which. by the time we get the next film out it will be shot digitally, it will be edited digitally, and, hopefully, in many theaters it will be released digitally - it will never have to go to film.are you going to shoot film as a backup?no, we're going to go for it.you once said that if you had one wish, it would be for \"infinite bandwidth.\" have you got it?the more you get, the more you want. we've been working with avid ever since we sold them editdroid seven or eight years ago. they said, \"what do you need in terms of storage? we can store 20,000 feet of film now, and we're working to get 100,000.\" and we said, \"we can already store 500,000 feet with our system. we need to be able to store a million.\" now we're storing 1.2 million. we've continued to work with them to get a better interface, and we're trying to get the sound and the picture systems to talk to each other. we have a continuing wish list.the phantom menace is pretty epic both behind the scenes and on the screen.it's big. in the '60s, filmmaking started to get too expensive to have large crowd scenes and sets, so they stopped doing the gone with the winds and lawrence of arabias. people say, \"we don't want to do a big movie because it's too expensive.\" what gets confused is the difference between big and epic, and digital. with digital technology you get a lot more scope for the resources available. my earlier films were described as epics, but they were very small pieces, actually, designed to look more epic than they really were. for my tv series, we were essentially doing feature films for less than $4 million - with large crowd scenes, period street scenes, battles, all the big epic kinds of things.what's the most expensive shot in phantom menace?let me put it this way: on titanic the special effects cost about $50 million and there were about 500 shots; same thing with starship troopers - 500 shots for $50 million. in star wars: episode 1 there are almost 2,000 shots, and the budget is around $60 million. you do the math.so your r&d has paid off.throughput is very, very fast now, and we've developed dozens of programs: a very sophisticated real-time facial animation system, a lot of motion capture software that also allows us to work in real time, software to simulate fabric realistically and of course things like hair and skin that we had even before episode 1. all of the effort has been in trying to speed up the process and make it more efficient.and a good thing, too - you're working right down to the wire.we're doing more than 50 shots a week, very complex shots, harder than anything anybody's ever done in movies, ever. we could make it even better if we were to spend twice as much, but what i'm trying to do is make it look good enough at a reasonable cost. the next picture we'll be able to improve on this one, and the next picture we'll improve further still, just like we did with the original star wars films.in fact, you're still tinkering with the special edition. will we one day see movies change from screening to screening?no. but all this technology is allowing filmmakers who control their films to have the ability to improve them - you do one theatrical release and then you can improve it for video.what happens if your vision and revisions conflict with the other artists in the film?everybody signs on to bring forth the director's vision - that's part of the way movies are made and always have been. the real issue is whether a corporation that buys the film 10 years later has the right to change it. my response continues to be no.is it hard to astound moviegoers who've grown up on a steady diet of films like starship troopers?astounding them is not my job. my job is to tell a story.this newest story seems more mature - a more ambiguous chronicling of anakin's drift to the dark side of the force. have you ever been tempted by the dark side?everyone has the dark side within, so there's a constant struggle to do the right thing. the good side is compassion and caring about other people, the dark side is greed and self-centeredness.how do you feel about the rebel alliance of unofficial web sites?the internet still hasn't figured out how to conduct itself in public. it's fascinating to watch, like a little village where everybody is trying to develop the rules by which they can conduct themselves in order to keep a civil operation going and not self-destruct.the complicated issues are going to be down the road, with copyright and intellectual property. it will be interesting to see how the software, music, and film industries survive that onslaught. fortunately, i think the movie business will be the last to get hit.so what's your internet strategy?we've been involved in the web forever, but we held back purposely for a long time. i've had a lot of experience jumping into technologies too early, and there's no advantage to it. you can get burned out before the market develops, for the privilege of saying \"i was there first.\" realizing this film was going to be such a big event, we started taking advantage of the web site. but it's not just a publicity site for the movies - it's a potential offshoot company, like lucas learning and lucasarts, and it's operated as a business. we have a store and we have plans for other ways of making it work.star wars will certainly keep capturing eyeballs - can you expand beyond that?star wars is our base, and we have another six to ten years of solid - and probably growing - traffic that we can depend on for our business. when there's sufficient bandwidth and speed, we'll start to look at the site as a distribution mechanism for the more software-oriented things we produce - games, films, and music. we're just paddling the water, waiting for the technology to catch up. we don't want to make our big moves too early.big-screen industry wags say phantom menace will outgross titanic, plus resuscitate a moribund toy industry; it's now a foregone conclusion you'll have a $100 million opening weekend.i've never got that involved in the success side of these things. my hope is that the film makes enough money so that i can make a new one. but i don't judge my movies by how well the public accepts them. my own yardstick is, how much have i enjoyed the process and am i proud of the results?life sends you down certain paths. when toy companies come to you and say they want to make toys, and then those toys wind up being incredibly successful, what are you going to do? say, \"no! i'm not going to give them to you\"? when i see opportunities i like to take advantage of them, but that's not what i'm focused on. by paying attention to the business side i've managed to buy my freedom. if i were just a director without the security to make my own movies, i would have wound up directing episodes of er. telling somebody else's stories doesn't interest me.you control your own destiny to a degree most filmmakers can only dream of. it's funny, because even though you've left hollywood geographically ...i was never in hollywood geographically.well, you went to the university of southern california.that's in central los angeles, which is a long way from hollywood. and when i went to usc there was no way a film student could break into the business. so a lot of us basically left. we said if we can't get in we'll start our own film business in san francisco.who are the next renegades - some of your torchbearers?there's obviously a large group of young filmmakers that come through our company and go off to make their own films as directors, producers, and writers. then there are the countless people who come up to me and say i'm the reason they got into the film business in the first place. anytime you're doing the kinds of things i'm doing - making popular films and at the same time running a large company - you have a lot of apprentices and a lot of other people who are influenced by you, either by going into the movies or using the lessons of the movies in their daily life. two thousand people worked on this film, and i would say 200 of them were hand-picked by me and producer rick mccallum.would you consider handing the star wars reins to someone else?nope. even for episode 5 and 6, which i did not direct, i was very involved - basically the same as directing. this is my thing.so you're going to direct episode 2?inevitably.what about the reports that episodes 7, 8, and 9 - which exist in novel form - will never reach the screen?the sequels were never really going to get made anyway, unlike 1, 2, and 3, where the stories have existed for 20 years. the idea of 7, 8, and 9 actually came from people asking me about sequels, and i said, \"i don't know. maybe someday.\" then when the licensing people came and asked, \"can we do novels?\" i said do sequels, because i'll probably never do sequels.so, are you closing the door? or are you just saying, maybe, maybe not?if i take a few years off after the prequels - episode 3 is set for 2005 - by the time i finished the three sequels i'd be 75, and i'm not interested in doing star wars for the rest of my life. i have a lot of other movies i want to make."}
