task force. does a reorg mean more or less spam for the net? by chris oakes.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "science", "type": "article", "timestamp": "05.04.1999 09:15 AM", "text": "spam fighters are bracing for the fallout from a restructuring at america online that eliminated a unit dedicated to eliminating the unwanted solicitations. as anti-spam experts worry that recent job cuts by aol will gradually weaken the internet service provider's ability to snuff out junk email campaigns launched from its accounts, the company says recent cuts and a reshuffling strengthens its spam-fighting resources.aol cut three of six employees on its postmaster team, a group that had been carrying out the company's day-to-day spam-fighting activities. it is eliminating that department altogether and folding it into its internet mail gateway group, which was previously dedicated to running the service's email systems.aol announced layoffs in april, cutting 850 jobs both at america online and at its newly acquired netscape division.\"we have restructured our spam team in the aftermath of the merger with netscape,\" said aol spokeswoman tricia primrose. \"we've merged the two teams together so we've doubled the number of people focused on spam.\"primrose said that more people will actually be involved in spam fighting, although it will be only part of their duties. within the mail gateway team there will now be 12 members dealing with spam, double the postmaster team, she said. \"by combining teams and focusing them on the spam issue, we have actually ramped up even further our efforts,\" primrose said.but spam experts working to keep a ceiling on the immense amount of junk email crossing the internet each day worry that the moves could mean a gradual return to aol's status as a haven for spammers. spam fighters watch aol closely because its sheer size and volume of incoming and outgoing mail.\"it really depends on how many people they actually have reading and acting on complaints [of spam generated by aol accounts]\" said john mozena, co-founder and vice president of the coalition against unsolicited commercial email.\"that's where the rubber meets the road. if you have a team of 50 people, but only one person is going through reports and acting on them, you're not going to be effective, given aol's size.\"in recent years, america online has become a high-profile leader in the fight against junk email. spam experts say the company has drastically reduced the number of spammers launching email campaigns from aol accounts, and aggressively pursued legal action against spammers whose conduct affects the service.\"in the early days, aol had a real problem with reputation as far as stopping spammers,\" mozena said. \"it made a decision as a company to hire good people and spent money on the team, and on various legal efforts going after spammers. that was a good example for aol to set for the rest of the net.\"according to a source close to america online, the restructuring results in a reduced number of spam-fighting experts responding to reports of spam.primrose said the service's main focus is currently on incoming spam, which is the bulk of spam flowing through the service's mail gateway.but mozena points out that the service's problems are now primarily with incoming spam because they have been successful in cracking down on outgoing spam. \"their network no longer became attractive to spammers. that could change if it became clear that they weren't paying attention to outgoing spam.\"but primrose said reorganizing the service has in no way diminished its ability to fight spam, which she said uses a multi-pronged strategy, from filtering incoming and outgoing spam to prosecuting spammers.mozena said it's easy to see how such a division would fall under the cost-cutter's knife.\"net abuse teams aren't profit centers -- they're cost centers. when you start looking at places to cut costs, it's obvious to look at places that aren't making you any money.\"nick nicholas, executive director of the mail abuse prevention system, said mailing lists on internet abuse and spam have recently been rife with complaints of a less responsive aol spam team.nicholas says there's only one way to monitor and stop spammers and that's with human staffers.\"[cutting the team] would mean they're less able to track abuse involved in their domain,\" nicholas said. \"... it's labor intensive to do this. typically an effective spam abuse team at an internet service provider requires one team member per 200,000 members, he said.many isps don't recognize that a good net abuse team is an investment against future problems, mozena said. \"it's like buying insurance.\"mozena said it's difficult to quantify the amount of spam coming from individual isps, but he guesses complaints will surely rise once a company reduces its defenses. the effects take time to surface, however, he said.\"sooner or later you're going to have a problem,\" mozena said, referring to the possibility of a variety of abuses. \"hackers, crackers, denial of service attacks -- there are all sorts of bad things people can do with an email account.\""}
