high-priced tech and internet stocks are elbowed aside by wary investors. by david lazarus.", "author": "david lazarus", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "04.27.1999 02:30 PM", "text": "blue chip stocks snatched back the market's leadership position tuesday and rocketed to an all-time high. tech and internet shares, weighed down with those blubbery valuations, remained earthbound. the dow jones industrial average rose 113.12 points to close 10831.71 -- just a hop, skip, and jump away from the 11000 mark. the blue-chip index remained firmly in the plus column throughout the session, fueled in large part by solid earnings from at&t and news that ibm plans to buy back a bunch of its shares.can't say the same for the silicon and dot-com crowd. investors wasted little time in distancing themselves from many of the stocks that had been out front in recent days as worries crept back in about towering price-earnings ratios. some modest selling in the morning turned into a wholesale retreat as traders chose to play it safe by pocketing their winnings.the wired index slid 6.10 to 676.72 and the nasdaq composite index was 49.90 lower at 2602.15. the s&p 500 was up 2.75 at 1362.79.joseph battipaglia, chief investment officer at gruntal & co., said net stocks in particular are running into \"very sizable resistance.\" one factor, he said, is that everyone who wanted to attend this particular party already may be in the house.\"who's left that hasn't bought internet stocks that wanted to?\" battipaglia wondered. \"people are saying these are very wonderful companies, but enough already, price-wise.\"tell that to the day traders. while net stocks may be running short of long-term investors, there are still plenty of itchy-fingered cowboys gathered in darkened rooms who remain more than willing to throw money -- for a minute or two -- at anything with an online pedigree.the latest beneficiary of this lunacy is an outfit called razorfish (razf), a new york web-design firm. its stock more than doubled to us$33.50 on its first trading day after debuting with 3 million shares initially priced at $16 apiece. at least razorfish comes with some impressive credentials, including clients like ebay and charles schwab. once the day traders have their say, and the company's stock settles at a more sensible level, this might be one to take a closer look at.speaking of ebay (ebay), everyone's favorite beanie baby emporium advanced 25 cents to $209.25 after beating estimates with quarterly income of 5 cents a share. the company's stock was upgraded by salomon smith barney to \"buy\" from \"outperform.\"similarly, priceline.com (pcln) jumped $8.94 to $129.69 as merrill lynch joined in the chorus singing the company's praises. \"priceline's early hyper-growth suggests that it could quickly become one of the largest internet commerce companies,\" gushed analyst henry blodget. and somewhere right now, william shatner is thanking his lucky stars that he accepted stock options to serve as priceline's pitchman.amazon.com (amzn) slipped $1.31 to $205.88 on word that it had shelled out $645 million for a trio of new acquisitions aimed at boosting its online offerings. among the purchases is exchange.com, a purveyor of rare books and music. amazon is expected to report a widening loss when it posts its latest results on wednesday.of perhaps greater interest was america online's (aol) showing when it revealed its own earnings after the closing bell. profit of 9 cents a share was anticipated -- and aol said last week that it's \"comfortable\" with this number -- but investors were eager to see if the company could do even better, and whether quarterly revenue would surpass a billion dollars for the first time ever.with expectations running so high, many on the street were bracing for disappointment. aol's shares were down $7.44 at $154.56.\"there's a hesitancy on the part of investors to push the momentum gains in the broader market,\" gruntal's battipaglia said. among tech stocks, he prefers some of the nuts-and-bolts concerns like chipmakers, network-service providers, and database specialists.ibm (ibm) rose $1.13 to $211 after the company's board approved buying back $3.5 billion of stock and boosting the quarterly dividend by 9 percent. a two-for-one split also got the green light following hefty gains for big blue's share price in the wake of a surprisingly strong quarter.apple computer (aapl) climbed 12 percent to $45.75 as goldman sachs placed the company on its \"recommend list.\" but dell computer (dell) shed $1.63 to $43.19, and intel (intc) was $2.19 lower at $62.25.at&t (t) gained 19 cents to $53.13 after cruising past estimates with first-quarter income of 61 cents a share, up nearly 40 percent from a year ago. separately, the telco said it would partner with japan's nippon telegraph and telephone to provide data service to corporate clients. all this helped to distract attention from at&t's bidding war with comcast to purchase cable company mediaone group.the rivalry grew a bit more interesting as the wall street journal reported that comcast may look to team up with microsoft or aol to become a leading force in digital tv and high-speed net access. such a deal, the journal said, may have some influence with mediaone shareholders as they mull which marriage proposal to accept. comcast (cmcsa) rose $2 to $66.25, and mediaone (umg) was up $3 at $81.81.northern telecom (nt) dropped $2.19 to $72.25 after disappointing investors by meeting expectations with quarterly profit of 33 cents a share, excluding charges. in the wake of rival lucent technologies whipping estimates, traders had hoped to see some similar sizzle from nortel. not this time.lastly, disney (dis) fell $2.44 to $32.56 as it reported a 41 percent decline in quarterly earnings to 13 cents a share, in line with expectations. the mouse house took a hit on its purchase of a 43 percent stake in infoseek, and wasn't up to snuff on its home video and merchandise sales.big cheese michael eisner called the results \"disappointing,\" but stressed the company's high hopes for its theme-park, resort and cruise operations. wall street didn't see it that way, and disney's stock was promptly downgraded by a pair of leading brokerages."}
