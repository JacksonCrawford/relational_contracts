for virtually all of 1999, the investment banking firm deutsche banc alex.brown's answer has been a polite no. it rated oakley's stock \"market perform,\" brokerese for \"don't buy.\"\"the billion-dollar goal,\" says one market maven, \"is currently just a flying leap.\"say what the skeptics will, oakley is convinced that broad-brand expansion is the logical and natural next step. with their sunglasses already endorsed by an army of sponsored athletes that includes michael jordan, jannard and baden believe that wider success is, in part, a matter of having a giant coming-out party - and to throw it, oakley installed a marketing expert from gatorade as ceo.\"a lot of the growth we've promised can result from just letting people know what we already make,\" says baden. what oakley creates, he insists, is not sunglasses, but sculpture. \"we're inventors using technology to make artistic creations with mechanical souls,\" he says.baden certainly kicks off the company tour in original fashion. i follow him out of the lobby, through a conference room, and past a hidden door. \"this is where they planned my kidnapping,\" he says, flicking a switch that bathes a dusty corridor in red light. we walk to an opening where several black helmets sit on top of 12 gym lockers. a chalkboard to one side is scrawled with words like delta, flash, and trouble.\"we've got guys here who like to dress up like a swat team and grab people,\" baden says, chuckling. \"for my 37th birthday they kidnapped me and threw me out of a plane.\"in 1975, jim jannard was a 25-year-old dropout from the pharmacy school at usc. he sold motorcycle parts out of a honda civic, naming his distribution company after his english setter, oakley. jannard had always been mechanically minded; as a kid growing up outside la, he drew engine pieces and built a helium-balloon flying machine. so it was natural for him to start thinking about improvements on the handlebar grips he was peddling.\"i'd have suggestions, and the response was typically, 'shut up and go sell,'\" says jannard. \"so i executed my own ideas.\" jannard invented unique cam-shaped grips that became a hit. the grips led to motorcycle goggles in the late 1970s and, later, to ski goggles. then, during a particularly sun-blinded drive from san diego to la in 1983, jannard started thinking about his next move: \"i figured, 'why not put goggle characteristics like peripheral protection and face fit into sunglasses?'\"jannard worked on the design for more than a year before oakley's terminator-look shields, first called factory pilots and later eyeshades, debuted in 1985. other sunglasses execs guffawed at what looked like goggle lenses that had been orphaned and attached to spindly temples. but an american cyclist named greg lemond discovered oakleys and started racing in them. when he finished second in the 1985 tour de france, the shades were legitimized overnight.\"our first products incorporated lens geometry so there would be terrific optics,\" jannard says. \"we received patents right from the start.\" jannard used existing corrective technology to compensate for the view-distorting potential of highly curved lenses and worked it into a shield style. more aesthetically pleasing models called blades and razor blades quickly followed the eyeshades. by 1991, jannard and his approximately 200-person company released the dual-lens, wraparound-style eye jacket.the eye jacket offered a level of precise craftsmanship unprecedented in the industry. jannard claims they're the first pair of sunglasses with frames formed solely from computerized data. since that digital breakthrough, oakley has created increasingly complex frames and lenses while exploring new materials.along the way, the company stockpiled patents - it now has 441 of them, compared with the 155 that 62-year-old ray-ban owns. and oakley comes down aggressively on copycats: it has flushed out numerous small-time operations that make knockoffs.\"last year oakley produced 3 million frames, and there were another million counterfeit models out there,\" says gregg weeks, oakley's general counsel. \"everything oakley makes gets copied.\"to hear weeks and jannard tell it, major sunglasses manufacturers are busy swiping oakley's designs as well. oakley has sued each of them for patent infringement and has won hundreds of such cases against large and small firms alike.__ \"we isolate ourselves to stay away from ordinary thought,\" says oakley's founder. \"if you can understand that, then you could like us.\" __jannard's company is now tangling with nike. oakley claims that nike, a relative newcomer to the sunglasses market, copied its xyz optics design for the rv8 and rv12 eyewear lines. nike's lawyers counter that the patent isn't valid, because it's based on widely known optical principles. many of oakley's browbeaten competitors would love to see nike win the trial, coming up sometime late next year. (a federal judge has already issued a preliminary ruling in oakley's favor.)since 1995, when he took oakley public to boost a then-sagging cash flow, jannard has been a multimillionaire, and he's become increasingly secretive. he lives with his wife in seclusion on one of the san juan islands in washington state and commutes to the oakley offices every other week by private aircraft. he refuses to have his picture taken, almost never gives interviews, and turns his public appearances into performance art. last summer, when oakley opened its one-of-a-kind o store in a socal mall, jannard was there wearing a gas mask and giving his speech through a megaphone.so i'm not especially shocked when, the first time we plan to meet, jannard stands me up. i'm at oakley hq, but it turns out he's not even in town.\"i'm terrifically absentminded,\" he tells me later. \"i missed the appointment because i forgot.\"where was he? \"uh ... somewhere off the earth.\"we isolate ourselves to stay away from ordinary thought or the state of the art as it currently exists,\" jannard continues, sounding exasperated. \"if you can understand that, then you could like us.\"i'm on the restricted side of a locked black-and-yellow door that warns, in red letters, caution: contents under extreme pressure. baden is showing me the fluorescent-lit oakley design department, a sprawling space with windowed offices around its perimeter. tacked to one workspace wall is a drawing of a vicious-looking, masklike object. on a table in another room is a clay carving of a rounded piece of armor that appears to snap over one's ears, with a slit for the eyes. i take a point-and-shoot from my shoulder bag and aim it at a desk covered with sketches. \"you can't take a picture in here,\" says baden. \"we don't want to give away the store.\"baden and i walk over to his open, tidy office area, and he grabs some drawings from a table behind his desk. the company's eyewear evolves from random creations and drawings by oakley's six designers. i'm shown a number of sunglasses temples that look like arrows; ideas for hinging mechanisms and other parts have been borrowed from the landing gear of a jet and the door handle of a porsche. it can take months to approve a designer's concept, but getting the final ok is refreshingly unbureaucratic: jannard and baden simply give a thumbs-up. \"focus groups only produce what people expect,\" says baden with a shrug. \"we like to deliver the unexpected.\"baden landed his job at oakley, aptly enough, by surprising jannard. in 1993 he was a partner at a bellevue, washington, architecture firm when he met oakley's founder, who was looking to build a house. jannard showed baden a couple of drawings and a clip from blade runner. then he gave the candidate a pencil and 45 minutes. baden produced a weird-looking pyramid, cut in half, with a freight train running over the top of it.baden's hyperbolic sensibility clicked with jannard. he hired baden's firm to continue drawing homes, and two years later, baden blueprinted oakley's headquarters. by 1996 the architect became the company's design director; earlier this year jannard made him president.we head to the rear of the department, stepping into a windowless room with two white-metal-and-glass boxes that look like kitchen cabinets. baden motions to a guy standing in front of a keyboard and monitor, and suddenly one of the empty kitchen cabinets comes alive. a laser beam is firing down into a vat of toxic, light-reactive resin that runs $2,000 a liter. there's a racket as the beam snakes around the resin in blue bolts of light delivered via digital commands. after six hours of this, a pair of prototype sunglasses frames will emerge, bearing the precise specs the designer called for. what looks like a cupboard is actually a $600,000 stereo lithography accumulator, a device used mostly in the aerospace industry for designing things like turbine blades.\"this is just the beginning,\" says baden. he motions me to follow him out the door.we walk into another room, where several cad stations are set up. at various stages - hand-sculpting, prototyping, and scanning - an embryonic pair of oakleys ends up on one of the monitors. \"see all this complexity?\" asks baden as he holds up a pair of purple oakley minute sunglasses and points to the carefully rounded temples. \"that's an insane amount of work.\"even now, the best scanning equipment available can provide oakley cad modelers with a 3-d image of the frame that's only about 25 percent accurate. the real touch-up is done using a mouse as if it were sandpaper. getting a pair of glasses just so - baden and his designers nitpick over details smaller than five-thousandths of an inch - can take a modeler a solid month of 16-hour days. then the data is used to precisely cut tooling that can cost more than $200,000.\"look at the way the surfaces blend,\" says baden. \"there's continuity. the lines flow like the body on a race car.\" cad modelers kurt sabin and dean jacobsen stand behind him, smiling. then he sets the minutes down and picks up a black-framed pair of sunglasses made by a competitor.\"see those curves? they don't even line up! and look at the dents on the nose bridge! the nose bridge\"as i study the two pairs, i realize he's right. the oakleys do look like sculpture. the arduous design process always brings baden's soldiers \"to the point where they say they can't do it again,\" he proudly admits. at oakley, the prototype count for one model has topped 1,000.\"these aren't sunglasses,\" says baden, staring at a frame prototype up on a screen. \"they're complex visual ideas painfully captured in data.\"__ x metal provided the thrill of inventing a material, an aesthetic, and a process all at the same time. __on a warm day last june, jim jannard was at the oakley hq addressing about 300 people tied to the company. he stood before them in oakley's auditorium and promised a brighter future than his corporation's leaden stock would indicate. oakley, he explained from behind a podium resembling a giant cog, had its sights set on global domination.\"making the leap from the best sunglasses company in the world to a world-class brand is a natural transition,\" he promised. then jannard left the floor, and most of the details about how all this was going to happen, to bill schmidt, his new - and, it turned out, temporary - ceo.an o will ultimately circle the earth, schmidt declared, now that the company is being \"reintroduced.\"jannard hired schmidt, who in the 1980s and '90s helped expand gatorade from a $100 million business to a $1.7 billion business, because the oakley chair was growing concerned about \"the expectations of our investors.\" after peaking at $27 a share four years ago, oakley's stock has been below $20 since 1997, just before a retail-sunglasses glut caused company sales to drop temporarily by $25 million. last fall, shares were trading at a paltry $6. the problem? mainly the lag in new products and oakley's not-always-successful attempts to diversify. even though the eyewear numbers have rebounded, oakley introduces at best a handful of new shades every year. each pair may be seamless, but while the oakley artisans toil away, ray-ban easily churns out 20 to 40 new looks annually. meanwhile, oakley's american-made athletic shoes, which it started manufacturing a year and a half ago, are losing money.\"shoes that are too expensive, a shortage of new product, and not enough media,\" summarizes marcia aaron, a managing director at deutsche banc alex.brown.schmidt, who came on as ceo in may after sitting on oakley's board of directors for 18 months, went hard at it from the start. he added a former mastercard sports-marketing vp to his staff and hired a boutique ad agency in san diego to kick off a print-advertising campaign. the ads are meant to appeal to oakley's 18- to 34-year-old customer base - as are most of the company's roughly 1,000 sponsored athletes.oakley tends to support the edgy and flamboyant: dennis rodman, drag-racing celeb scotty cannon, norway's defiant superchamp snowboarder, terje haakonsen. but athletes who appeal to a wider audience - like mark mcgwire, golfer david duval, and the everlasting mj - are increasingly important parts of the lineup. it was michael jordan, a longtime oakley fan, who suggested that the company could broaden its reach by making a more traditional line of sunglasses. schmidt was all for it.last summer, oakley introduced the relatively generic, wire-rimmed oo models. the $190 sunglasses' first-month numbers were superior to those of any other new-product release in company history.\"i've heard the argument, 'we're not into fashion, we're into technology, and the looks will follow,'\" schmidt said. \"well, sorry, but fashion has been an opportunity here just waiting to happen.\"schmidt's intentions seemed to match jannard's ambitions, but his personality, like the commercially successful but aesthetically underachieving oos, was an odd fit at oakley. while jannard appreciated what schmidt and the oos did for oakley's bottom line, he said, \"i wouldn't wear them.\"jannard and schmidt's philosophies, if not at complete odds, were clashing. \"growing pains,\" schmidt assured me over the summer, three months into his new job. sounding upbeat, he added, \"anyone who wears glasses can be an oakley consumer.\"the flip side of that proclamation, of course, is the possibility that too many aunties and plumbers sporting the o will set off the dork alarm. it happened to nike, a $9 billion company whose profits halved in 1998 in part because of swoosh oversaturation. \"when we're at a few billion, i'll worry,\" schmidt replied with a shrug.for a second opinion i called irma zandl, who heads an eponymous new york-based company that tracks trends among the under-30 crowd. she agreed with schmidt. \"it's absolutely possible to be cool and have a big business. look at gap or volkswagen. mom can cruise around in a jetta, and her kids can still want a beetle.\"one afternoon i do a little market research of my own. i drive to the irvine spectrum center for a firsthand look at the company's attempts to keep its cross-generational cool. among the mall's generic shops, the o store stands out. inside the brightly lit 1,790-square-foot space, kids with two-tone hair grab at shirts hanging on space-age clothing racks, while middle-aged women inspect oakley shoe twos. thumping alternative music complements a 45-square-foot video screen showing skateboarders in action.i'm trying on a pair of copper topcoat glasses and a skullcap when i realize there's a crowd gathering at the back of the shop.\"i don't know - it just caught my eye,\" says a customer, who is taken aback at the gawkers he's attracted. he holds his left arm out while assistant manager susie jacobson fits a gleaming $1,300 time bomb watch to his wrist.nearly everyone in the place is admiring it. \"i was going to buy a tag heuer, but this is strange, which is good,\" he says. the o store staffers nod in approval. \"i like it,\" he declares, \"because it says, 'beam me up.'\"on a 9 a.m. plane bound from orange county to reno, nevada, carlos reyes is already talking in high-octane oakley-speak. \"jim likes to say that we have an absolute obsession with making inventions that solve unsolved problems,\" says reyes, the company's goateed, 33-year-old vice president of r&d. \"when it came to x metal, we didn't even know of the problems. all we had to work with was the dream of an artistic metal frame.\"__ \"we call this place hades,\" says the vp of r&d. if liquid x metal comes in contact with water, he warns, there will be a \"hindenburg scenario.\" __we're en route to oakley's x metal facility. reyes says that in the early '90s jannard conceived of sunglasses with sculptured metal frames that weren't made out of the usual wire or stamped alloy. after years of intermittent research split among his employees, jannard settled on making the glasses out of an alloy from the titanium family because titanium is lightweight and hypoallergenic, and it has a better strength-to-weight ratio than other metals. \"then we had to find somewhere to manufacture it,\" says reyes, grabbing his shoulder bag as the plane stops at the gate.we drive 35 miles southeast through the brown-scrub desert. on the outskirts of the small town of dayton, a skull-and-crossbones flies next to an anonymous building. jannard plunked down about $7 million in 1996 for all the x metal equipment and the 62,000-square-foot facility, which used to be a golf-club factory.\"but we were still asking ourselves if we were going to be able to really make these frames,\" says reyes, leading me into a room that smells like melting candles. workers in blue aprons and clear-lens oakleys are forming thousands of green, waxlike sunglasses parts on 11 presses.most businesses that use titanium farm out the manufacturing because working with the metal is so tricky.\"i tried to discourage jannard from fooling with it. none of his people had casting backgrounds,\" says bob geisendorfer, a consulting metallurgist who has specialized in titanium for three decades. \"apparently that wasn't going to get in his way.\"jannard wanted control of the process so oakley designs wouldn't be hobbled by any manufacturing restrictions. after much trial and error, x metal frames were born in 1997, using a technique called investment casting.reyes starts walking me through the plant and the manufacturing steps: several dozen of the waxy sunglasses parts are attached to a 2-foot plastic tree. the entire assembly is dipped into a series of tubs containing particles and polymers that ultimately harden into ceramic coatings. \"now comes the climax,\" says reyes. we walk into a dark, industrial workspace where men wear silvery fire-retardant suits and welding masks. they're milling around in front of giant furnaces, concrete bunkers, and enormous steam machines.\"we call this place hades,\" reyes says.the grit-encrusted trees get an 800-degree-fahrenheit steam bath, which melts the waxy sunglasses parts inside and frees the resulting green goop through gates in the trees. what's left is a series of hollow ceramic molds. the tree is set in a gigantic steel cylinder behind 16-inch-thick concrete walls. once the vessel is clamped shut, the silver-suited men back off, we retreat into a windowed bunker, and red lights begin to flash. smoke spews from behind the wall as all the air is sucked out of the vessel. (if the liquid x metal cooking inside comes in contact with water, there will be a \"hindenburg scenario,\" offers reyes.) an attendant in a beret moves a joystick. on a black-and-white tv monitor we watch a 6-inch-thick cylinder of metal get melted by an electric arc.\"four hundred fifty thousand watts of power!\" exclaims reyes. on the screen we watch the 4,600-degree alloy pour into a funnel feeding the gates that channel x metal into the molds. when the tree comes out of the cylinder, it's white-hot.the process is far from over. after computer-controlled drilling, belt sanding, and a temple-by-temple inspection for air bubbles on a $100,000 real-time x-ray machine, the lenses are popped in and the finished products are boxed up. about 70 employees at the x metal facility put out 7,000 to 10,000 pairs of sunglasses a month, which is slow. (some low-end, offshore sunglasses factories produce as much in two days.)i walk out of the x metal facility, dazed as i reenter the sunny, warm nevada afternoon. reyes comes outside, and we get in the car and head back to the airport. while nobody at oakley will provide me with specifics, en route reyes guarantees that x metal sunglasses, at between $250 and $315 apiece, make the company a healthy profit.\"but that isn't the only reason we pursued x metal,\" says reyes. \"it was the thrill of trying to invent a material, an aesthetic, and a manufacturing process all at the same time.\"when jim jannard commits to meeting me several weeks later, he rolls out his version of a red carpet.\"pretty wicked, huh?\" brags greg schwartz as we approach the gray airplane with a giant skull-and-crossbones on the fuselage. it's an unseasonably crisp late-summer day at bellingham international, a diminutive airport 90 miles north of seattle. schwartz, one of jannard's two full-time pilots, helps me climb the ladder of the 60-foot, single-prop de havilland. we're en route to jannard's 500-acre fiefdom in the san juan islands.it's a 15-minute flight over a calm puget sound to jannard's island, which is shaped sort of like a bowling pin. right after schwartz kills the engine and i climb out, jannard pulls up in a hummer. \"enjoy your flight?\" he asks as i hop into the off-white, military-spec, four-wheeling vehicle. at 6' 2'', jannard is big-boned, with an austere, close-cropped head of hair and a gray beard. only his voice doesn't convey macgyver: it's an octave too high. \"this is no newport beach highway cruiser.\" he puts the hummer into gear. \"it's a working truck.\"starting down one of the island's dirt roads, jannard gives me a comprehensive tour. there are imported deer, elk, and sheep and stout douglas firs and maples. there are also his-and-her boats in the small harbor for jannard and his wife - and a yellow fire truck. despite the island's considerable beauty, jannard seems more interested in showing off his toys. another plane sits in a hangar, as does an old land rover bearing two inoperative machine guns. jannard also owns a yellow-and-black vehicle - part minivan, part tank - that was featured in judge dredd. there's a makeshift driving range near the couple's clapboard home, though jannard isn't as keen on playing golf as he is on designing clubs.\"i like cool stuff. i love cool stuff. i need cool stuff,\" he confesses as we sip tea in a kitchen nook that has a commanding view of the blue water. the cozy, cedar-lined, two-story house is temporary. if jannard and baden can ever hash out the aesthetics of the stone-and-steel dream home, it will be built on the island.\"i'm consumed with the concept of oakley, which to me means giving your most radical effort to making something better,\" says jannard, grabbing a frosted oatmeal cookie. \"when that thinking comes to sunglasses, sometimes the result will be a pair so outlandish that most people won't immediately be comfortable with them. to me, that's ok.\"jannard himself is never afraid to wear \"the full dose of oakley thinking,\" as he calls it. today it's a relatively conservative ensemble that's not yet in stores: a polo-style black oakley shirt, shoe threes, and a pair of x metal glasses he sets on the table. unfortunately for jannard, his backers don't wear it all as well as he does. instead, they're more in line with schmidt's sensibility: the more oakley product that appeals to more people, the better. when i raise the subject, he gestures to the specs on the table. \"we'll never make a commodity. ever.\"i read him what schmidt told me: \"with designers, it's always tinker, tinker, tinker. but at some point they have to break pencils and say, 'this is it.'\"__ \"i rarely look backward,\" jannard says. \"but going public is something i wish i hadn't done.\" __as he listens, jannard moves the smooth temples of the glasses open and closed. \"well, we aren't going to sell anything with defects,\" he says adamantly. \"that's out. forget that.\"his response to oakley's weak share price? buy back the stock. this year alone he's spent nearly $8.2 million doing so: with some 60 percent of the pie, he's the majority shareholder by far.\"people in the public arena don't appreciate who we are,\" jannard continues. \"oakley is a product-driven firm trying to make things that will keep us successful for years, and meanwhile the investors dwell on quarterly results.\" jannard is about to take another bite of his cookie but decides he has more to say. \"sure, the stock price irritates me. it irritates the shit out of me,\" he continues. \"but the remedy isn't just to grow our business. it's to grow it in an elegant way.\" the house phone rings, and jannard runs to answer it.he returns and sits down for not two minutes before it rings again. then his cell phone goes off, playing the theme from the lone ranger. then it's the house phone again. the tea gets cold. \"i rarely look backward, but going public is something i wish i hadn't done,\" he says between calls. \"i want oakley to be big, but big alone isn't cool.\"we go outside and walk a couple hundred yards to a smaller structure that's locked. jannard opens the door and leads me past pictures of his seven kids, all grown and living off-island, into a small, dark room alive with the buzz of fans cooling off machinery. there's an apple g3 and industrial-strength versions of a scanner, copier, and printer. in another corner is a high-definition tv, a digital-video machine, and camera equipment. jannard says a g4 will be coming soon.here, in an isolated building on a remote island, away from the suits and the phones, jannard can concentrate. \"i looked all over the world before i found this place,\" he says. \"this is home to how i think.\"jannard sits down in front of the monitor and shows me how he uses his setup to create personal and business videos, manipulate photographs, and build web sites for guys like scotty cannon, the oakley-sponsored drag racer. but when it comes to designing glasses, which he still does frequently, jannard pushes all the cool stuff aside. \"i'll just grab a crummy piece of paper and a pencil and start noodling. then i'll fax it to the office,\" he says. surprising, perhaps, when you consider that oakley has embraced high tech with a passion no competitor can match. but then jannard is all for doing things differently.\"there's no upside to being a business celebrity,\" he says while driving me back to the island runway. \"there are people who will like what i do and people who won't like what i do. as i get more successful, that only means more fans - and more detractors.\"as we pull up in front of the de havilland, i think of the irony in jim jannard's universe. his whole career has been dedicated to a product that's designed to call attention to its wearer, but what he wants is to disappear at will.nine days after my visit, i receive a one-sheet fax from oakley. schmidt has resigned, effective immediately. jannard's call follows a few minutes later. he obviously thinks the company is now on its way to fulfilling its potential.\"instead of waiting to have someone else take control of oakley, i'm going to roll up my sleeves and do it myself,\" he says. \"i'm so stoked to be back in the saddle!\" jannard is politic about schmidt's departure. \"two great entities don't always fit together,\" he says. what of the plan to satisfy shareholders? \"we'll still have some adult supervision here,\" he insists. \"and i'll be at the company headquarters for every important meeting.\"but i've got to go,\" he adds. \"i've got a company to run.\" we hang up. and i wonder if this isn't the crisis he needs.\"i've been discouraged by everything i've tried to do,\" jannard told me once. \"and being discouraged inspires me.\""}
