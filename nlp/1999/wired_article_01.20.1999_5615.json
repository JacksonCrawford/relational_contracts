i know of women who are knock-down gorgeous who are hackers.\"shipley said that criminal profiles are proven to work to track down serial killers but that \"the hacker profile is so diverse and wide that a strong profile could not be useful.\"rogers characterized members of one subgroup he called \"cyberpunks\" as socially inept, burdened with unresolved anger that they take into cyberspace.\"they relate better to computers than humans,\" rogers said. \"they can spend hours and days glued to a computer.\"he described an incident several years ago when investigators raided a residence, expecting to find a computer left running an automated attack. a machine at that location had been attempting the same routine on a system for days.what the investigators found instead, rogers said, was a man suffering from a mental disorder. \"he had a porta-potty under the seat, and he was buzzed out on coca-cola and candy.\"shipley said that rogers was going for shock value with such descriptions. \"he is trying to paint hackers as 25-year-old men who can't control their bowels.\"rogers said that while there was no empirical evidence linking computer criminals with what he termed computer-addictive disorder, hackers tend to be obsessive types.shipley and freelance network engineer aaron peterson said that the intense, focused mindset typical of someone trying to model a problem could easily be mischaracterized as obsessive.rogers closed out his talk with a grim scenario for corporate america. he said that some crackers claim to be under contract to fix y2k legacy code and are in a position to introduce all manner of logic bombs and back doors into the \"fixed\" code.\"i think you are going to find a real mish-mash of things happening once the year 2000 rolls along,\" he said.michael king, spokesman for the hackers defense fund, said he had never heard of such a claim.\"generally, people won't tell even their best friends something like that,\" king said. \"there are not many [crackers] out there who would let themselves get that carried away.\"editor's note: this story has been corrected. in the original article, rogers' description of the cyberpunk -- the most visible group of hackers -- was inadvertantly applied to all hackers. wired news regrets the error."}
