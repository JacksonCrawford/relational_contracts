(amazon.com still carries the book, so uk customers can purchase it there.)the controversy over a piece of blue sky, like most matters involving the church of scientology, is far more byzantine. the book's removal was sparked by legal threats from margaret hodkin, a subject in author jon atack's harsh expos\u00e9 of the church. an english court had ruled in favor of hodkin in a libel action against atack in 1995, and her lawyers now demanded that amazon.com remove the title from its catalog.on the advice of counsel, amazon.com eliminated a piece of blue sky from its log in february. the move didn't become public until may, when alt.religion.scientology watchdogs accused amazon.com of caving in to church pressure.the church of scientology has been aggressively going after online content it deems objectionable. in june, a group affiliated with the church pressured at&t to reveal the identity of a critic using the company's worldnet service to post scientology secrets in alleged violation of copyrights.amazon.com general manager carl gish, the executive responsible for what the site sells, denies the company succumbed to church pressure. but he concedes, \"we overreacted. it was the wrong decision. because we don't have the constraints of a physical bookstore, we're held to a higher standard - as we should be.\"less than four months after atack's book was removed (and hours after the online news media picked up the story), a piece of blue sky was back for sale at amazon.com. the book's sales immediately skyrocketed, with the title briefly making amazon.com's top 100 best-sellers list. now, the university of california press is considering publishing a new hardcover edition.despite the book's reinstatement, amazon's snap decision to ban two books in the face of legal threats seemingly contradicts the high-minded free-speech ideals the company often spouts. but perhaps the billion-dollar bookseller that has yet to turn a profit has learned to live with contradiction.must readschlock till you dropaccess maniaceos with ballsvirtual book burningtired/wiredkeeping it digitalpeoplejargon watchedifice complexthose who can't launch, teachit's a bitch being richwhite hat hackercapturing eyeballsraw data"}
