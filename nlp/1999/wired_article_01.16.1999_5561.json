may be a new model for online activism. by theta pavis.", "author": "theta pavis", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "01.16.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "put together two of the most powerful gay groups in the country and what do you get? a combination many say could usher in a new wave of online activism.the announcement that digital queers, a tech-savvy group with strong ties to silicon valley, is joining forces with the gay & lesbian alliance against defamation means \"internet activism can be taken to a new level,\" said joan garry, glaad's executive director.the merger also highlights the growing importance of the internet as a tool for political activism.with the new alliance, glaad, already a powerful watchdog group, will begin to monitor online media and build contacts with the tech community. glaad focuses on getting fair representations of gays and lesbians in film, television, and the news. now it will also be watching cyberspace.\"this merger is really exciting,\" said urvashi vaid, director of the national gay and lesbian task force's policy institute. \"it will generate a tremendous amount of activism around media issues.\"digital queers and glaad celebrated their union with a panel discussion on internet privacy and access during the last day of the macworld expo, 8 january, in san francisco.together the groups plan to create a technology advisory board in silicon valley, where digital queers' 4,000 members have strong connections. digital queers has raised money in the past from apple, microsoft, and sun microsystems.tim gill, chairman of the quark corporation and president of the gill foundation -- which has funded digital queers -- said the merger is an important step because it will increase glaad's ability to monitor online media. plans are also underway to hire an \"internet evangelist\" to build relationships in silicon valley and to build an intranet to link the six glaad offices around the country.despite the fact that \"many gay and lesbian people are involved at all levels of the high-tech industry, not that much activism has come out of that industry yet,\" said vaid. one exception, she said, is the creation of gay and lesbian employee associations at companies like microsoft, lotus, lucent technologies, and at&t.digital queers was unique, she said, in that it was made up of silicon valley tech types who decided to take their \"skills into the civil rights movement.\"in 1993, digital queers set out to get all of the national gay and lesbian offices in the united states wired. having accomplished that, its members were wondering what to do next.the san francisco-based group has raised money for more than 100 computer systems provided to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender organizations across the country and has trained 1,500 gay activists in online organizing.glaad, meanwhile, has become a major lobbying force for gay and lesbian civil rights. in 1992, entertainment weekly called it one of hollywood's most powerful entities. after meeting with glaad in 1987, the new york times changed its editorial policy to using the word \"gay\" rather than \"homosexual.\"glaadalert, the organization's weekly online newsletter, reaches about 80,000 people a week. the group has roughly 10,000 members.the merger will make glaad \"the ultimate cyber queer organization,\" said digital queers co-founder tom rielly.both garry and rielly said the internet is key to their work because it allows gays and lesbians to be activists while remaining in the closet.\"the internet is truly saving lives because it is connecting closeted people and empowering them to be activists,\" garry said. she said activism leads many to come out eventually. while plenty of other groups use the internet to organize, rielly said a gay household is 50 percent more likely than a straight one to be online -- and therefore more likely to respond.loren javier, glaad's interactive media director, said the medium is especially important as a lifeline for gay and lesbian youth. when he ran a support group for gay youth in los angeles last year, javier said four out of five found their way to the group through the internet.this year the internet played a major role in setting up vigils for matthew shepard, a 21-year-old openly gay college student killed in wyoming, and in organizing around the america online privacy case involving a gay navy officer.garry said a recent print campaign launched by the center for reclaiming america and other groups -- promoting the \"conversion\" of lesbians and gay men to heterosexuality -- also made glaad rethink some of its strategy.\"what we saw this year was so many direct attacks [on gays], it gave glaad pause to say, 'as we move into the 21st century, how can we do our work differently?'\" garry said.mounting a countercampaign to the center for reclaiming america cost glaad us$50,000, garry said, whereas organizing online could be more cost-effective.rielly, 34, is a former silicon valley marketing executive and a founder of the online community planet out. he became interested in joining forces with glaad in 1997 after the group published access denied, a report on the impact of filtering software on the gay community.glaad plans to update the report this year.rielly said the explosion of the internet changed the nature of digital queers' work, making it a perfect time to join forces with a group like glaad.\"the internet is becoming a media thing. the notion of what is a digital queer has expanded considerably,\" he said."}
