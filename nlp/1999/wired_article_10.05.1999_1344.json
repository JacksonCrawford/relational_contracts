[sic]\" wrote cher castillo, an aide to rep. alcee hastings (d-fl), in the original message.but many recipients directed their complaints to all the other recipients when they hit reply all. this further jammed the already-taxed house mail servers, creating widespread annoyance, and preventing some house offices from receiving any email at all.one response that was particularly ill-received came from steve maviglio, chief of staff for rep. rush holt (d-nj), who -- perhaps inadvertently -- replied to everyone, lecturing them on the evils of spam and requesting that they support his boss' anti-spam legislation.\"when i first got it [the spam], i immediately reported it to house information resources,\" he said.then maviglio wrote, \"how would you like to receive thousands of these each day??? our constituents do -- costing them money and invading their privacy. stop spam!!!!\"and then? \"i hit reply all,\" he said.maviglio said that microsoft exchange showed only a few dozen recipients.ooops.some of the recipients -- there are about 20,000 hill email addresses, though not all were copied -- thought that maviglio had orchestrated the original diet pill spam to promote the so-called can spam act that his office is co-sponsoring.he denies it. \"all i know is that my name showed up as the first one in many emails so people thought we did it. we're creative but not that creative. besides, it's against house rules,\" he said.a sampling of the hundreds of replies he received: \"undeliverable mail.\" \"i hate you.\" \"take me off your list.\" \"die.\"some irked hill staffers who saw their inboxes swell last friday with \"get-me-off-this-list\" replies say that a new law isn't the answer.\"people are trying to blame other people to solve problems they caused themselves,\" said one aide, who asked not to be identified. \"they should be disciplined.\"some congressmen joined the fray, writing that castillo had violated house rules, and other recipients warned that the diet pills suggested in the original message should not be used to lose weight.ironically, if the can spam act had become law -- currently no hearings are scheduled -- maviglio could be liable for a us$25,000 fine, or \"the actual monetary loss suffered by the provider as a result of the violation,\" whichever is larger.and what about cher castillo, the original spammer? her office refused to comment and she did not respond to interview requests.one staffer who complained to hasting's office last week about castillo said at first they didn't take the spam seriously. \"but by today they weren't laughing,\" the staffer said."}
