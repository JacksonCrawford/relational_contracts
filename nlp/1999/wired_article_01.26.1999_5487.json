absolutely.\"at the same time, compaq cut a deal with microsoft (msft) to make altavista the new search engine of choice for redmond's online properties. this was a blow to inktomi (inkt), microsoft's former search partner, which saw its shares plunge 13 percent to $129.25. compaq advanced $2.56 to $49.25, and microsoft was up $9.69 at $171.56.does the world need another web portal? looks like it's going to get one. the fine print of the compaq-microsoft contract includes altavista gaining access to microsoft's hotmail email service, plus instant-messaging technology expected in the near future.not that this would pose much of a threat to industry leader america online (aol), which rose $7.63 to $153.63. the world's biggest online service said it now has 3 million customers outside the united states, including 1 million compuserve subscribers. aol is expected to come through with a profit of 14 cents a share when it reports its latest earnings on wednesday.some other familiar names were slated to report their own earnings, or persistent lack of same, after the closing bell. amazon.com (amzn) was expected to post a quarterly loss of 18 cents a share, its largest ever. but analysts say the money-bleeding bookseller should see its losses shrinking from here onward, although profitability is still nowhere in sight. amazon's stock was $2.81 higher at $115.19.online auctioneer ebay (ebay), for its part, was expected to come through with an actual profit of 4 cents a share. the company shrugged off a newspaper story that it's under investigation for fraud by the new york city department of consumer affairs, and was able to focus instead on a cheerful forecast from market researcher jupiter communications that online auctions should account for more than $7 billion in sales over the next four years. ebay gained $2.56 to $220.06.yahoo (yhoo) jumped 13 percent to $351.25, and lycos (lcos), soon-to-be parent of wired news, was up $5.19 at $110.38. but it's too early to say that topsy-turvy net stocks are settling in once again at their lofty valuations. don't be surprised by further volatility in weeks ahead.\"people are still afraid,\" said prudential's merenbloom. \"are we at the top? what's going to push these stocks higher? what's going to push them lower? once you start asking these questions, you realize there are no easy answers.\"ibm (ibm) climbed $3.50 to $185.50 on word of its stock split for shareholders of record as of 10 february. the announcement follows a similar move by microsoft a day earlier, and has helped to maintain investor interest in the computer business, which faces an uncertain outlook now that the holiday-season sales bump is in the rearview mirror.globalstar telecommunications (gstrf) soared 10 percent to $19.89 after winning approval to resume launching satellites from kazakhstan for its orbital telephony system. the company, which lost a dozen satellites last september when a rocket went boom, said it now plans to have 32 birds aloft by summer, and for commercial service to begin in september.emc (emc), the leading maker of data-storage systems for corporate big guys who, well, have lots of data to store, slipped 25 cents to $101.75 even as it reported a 54 percent hike in quarterly profit to 48 cents a share. this was a couple pennies ahead of the street's expectations, but investors are concerned that spending on big-ticket network systems may decline as enterprise clients tighten their belts.also from the earnings front, xerox (xrx) vaulted $10.75 to $116.13 after posting a better-than-expected 17 percent increase in quarterly profit to $1.69 a diluted share. the company also announced a two-for-one stock split. drugmaker merck (mrk), meanwhile, rose $3.38 to $140.88 after hitting the street's target with net income of $1.16 a diluted share.happy meal anyone? mcdonald's (mcd) advanced $2.94 to $ 78.81 after meeting expectations with quarterly profit of 64 cents a share, and announcing a two-for-one stock split of its own. investors washed that down with news that coca-cola's (ko) earnings were off 27 percent at 24 cents a share, which was nevertheless where analysts had figured they'd be. coke's stock fell 38 cents to $62.56.lastly, service corp. international (srv), the world's largest funeral-home and cemetery owner, sank 44 percent to $19.25 after warning that its fourth-quarter earnings will be nearly half the 42 cents a share anticipated by industry watchers. the company blamed the shortfall on fewer people dying recently in its biggest markets.bummer."}
