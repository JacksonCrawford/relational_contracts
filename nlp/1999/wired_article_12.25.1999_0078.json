for a glimpse at the future, craig maynard points to the robot world's pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: the honda walking robot.he has seen the robot in action and is amazed by the 6-foot-tall humanoid that acts \"like [a] guy in space suit,\" maynard said. \"he can walk across the room, up stairs ... if you push they'll catch their balance. they can move, turn, and interact just like you and i can.\"maynard manufactures and sells (worldwide and at a brisk pace, he reports) \"cybugs, robotic insects designed to behave and interact with each other like the real thing.to what end, all this droidal replication of human functions? good question. even the experts don't pretend to know what the future holds.as maynard put it, \"you've got to imagine stuff we haven't seen before.\"maybe they'll take care of simple security tasks: adjust the air temperature, monitor the furnace for problems, watch for prowlers, he suggested. they might bring more real-world dimensions to computer games, and entertainment value. \"games could come out of computer and start interacting with people again -- versus the computer, which sits there like a big window,\" noted maynard.rather than having to expensively retrofit every home's electrical, plumbing, and heating infrastructure to make them smart, the robot could be the mobile brain, learning to adapt to the controls, knobs, and systems the house already has. \"instead of making the house match the computer, i make the computer match the house.\"he imagines a personal robot with a fleet of pc-like \"peripherals\": arms, legs, and other extensions to accommodate the surrounding physical world's varying interface requirements, such as different doorknobs, switches, and appliances.tapped into the internet, robots could become a consumer telepresence, standing in for people in distant places. for example, a camera-enabled robot in the louvre could be manipulated over the net by a user in new york who wants to view the museum's collections from afar.\"what this thing could do, how you could interact with it, i don't know, exactly. it's going to take some thinkers to figure out what people might want to do with these things.\"but technologically and commercially, enthusiasts are sure the industry is approaching critical mass. \"everything's all coming together, maynard said. \"it's just waiting for some young steve wozniak who's gonna find its little niche.\""}
