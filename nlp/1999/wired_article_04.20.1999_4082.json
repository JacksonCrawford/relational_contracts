and computerized decor. it's about as modern as modern dance gets. after a 50-year-career, the legendary choreographer is still breaking new ground. and biped, set to premiere 23 april at zellerbach hall in berkeley, california, is the latest collaboration between cunningham and designers paul kaiser and shelley eshkar, from the new york multimedia art studio riverbed.kaiser, then an experimental filmmaker, founded riverbed in 1994. the studio is responsible for everything digital in cunningham's newest piece.kaiser discussed the project last week at autodesk's multimedia division discreet, which publishes the software that he used for the animation.waiting for the computer to boot up so he could demonstrate part of the project, kaiser said biped had yet to be seen in its entirety, even by its creators.\"we did one run-through with some of the clips and a few of the dancers in ... late february. aside from that, we won't have any idea how this will work until the dress rehearsal.\"kaiser seems strangely calm given the situation. but leaving things to chance is cunningham's stock in trade. the 80-year-old choreographer is known for making artistic decisions by rolling the dice. when cunningham works with music, his dancers typically rehearse in silence while the composer works independently on the score.\"merce treated the visual decor [for biped] in the same way,\" said kaiser. \"he feels it's more interesting to have the visuals uncoupled from the dancing.\"so kaiser and eshkar were pretty much on their own to create the animations and visual decor.\"at first, shelley and i were conservative,\" said kaiser, who also collaborated with cunningham on a four-minute virtual dance installation last year. \"we didn't want the visuals to distract viewers from the actual dancing.\" but cunningham \"wasn't concerned with the technology overshadowing the dancers,\" said kaiser. \"he was more interested in the collision between the two worlds.\"the animations were created by first doing a motion capture of 19 to 20 movement sequences of cunningham's choreography. the capture was done at brooklyn's modern uprising studios using three cunningham dancers.over 30 reflective spheres, called markers, were placed on each dancer's body. as they performed in the circular studio, 10 optical cameras recorded the movement of the markers as mathematical coordinates to create a \"three-dimensional data set.\"the data was fed into a workstation to reconcile the points, meaning the movement of each marker was mapped according to time and space. next, the dancers' movements were translated onto biped, an animated 3-d figure in the software program character studio -- and cunningham's inspiration for the title of his new work.eshkar changed the look of the strict motion capture movement by hand-drawing artistic renderings of the virtual dancers based on the biped figure. these animated sketches are what the audience will see in the performance.character studio, developed in 1996, is best known for having created the dancing baby phenomenon. but game developers, scientists, physical therapists, and choreographers have all used the software in their work.the animation software is particularly well-suited for dance because its patented, footstep-driven, keyframe approach makes it possible to capture precise and subtle movements. it's also the first program to allow motion capture data to be animated. kaiser and eshkar used a version of character studio that was designed as a plug-in for autodesk's 3dstudio to create biped's animations and set. kaiser used some of the same technology last year for his first collaboration with cunningham, a virtual dance installation called hand-drawn spaces. a similar collaboration with choreographer bill t. jones resulted in ghostcatching, which premiered in january at the cooper union in new york.software improvements allowed kaiser and eshkar to capture a greater range of movement for biped, said kaiser.\"the major difference ... is that in biped, there are actual dancers sharing performance space with virtual dancers and projected abstract images. and half the piece -- roughly 23 minutes -- uses the technology.\"kaiser has not always been a geek or, for that matter, an artist. a former english teacher, he discovered computers at age 23 while working with severely learning disabled children. the multimedia tools he created for the learning disabled won kaiser a computer world/smithsonian award in 1991, and in 1996 he became the first interactive artist to receive a guggenheim fellowship.so far, kaiser's ego remains intact. he is gracious and unassuming and seems just as content discussing his childhood dog or the great underwater shot he took of his smiling 6-year-old as he does his cutting-edge work in digital dance.as the biped figure appeared on his screen, kaiser explained that the animated movement was choreography from the new piece.the figure appeared blocky, almost wooden. though its movements were unmistakably cunningham -- fast footwork, angular lines, and a flexible spine -- it lacked the signature grace and fluidity of a merce cunningham dancer.the hand-drawn figures, however, were pure artistry. their spare, calligraphic style and saturated blues, reds, and purples had a surprisingly emotive quality. in the performance, the sketched animations -- or hand-drawns, as kaiser calls them -- will be projected in front of the dancers on a large scrim. they will also be projected in the middle of the stage, where virtual and real dancers will mingle, and on slim white panels placed at intervals along the back wall.the backdrop was a decision kaiser and cunningham made together, kaiser said, so as not to duplicate the front scrim's projected images. the slim panels will create slivers of images and movement on the back wall.cunningham, who is usually tight-lipped about his intentions when creating new work, told kaiser that he saw biped as working with the idea of television channel-surfing.this motif was apparent in the demonstration -- movement phrases are combined and recombined, and scale and pacing are in constant flux. the scrim in front suddenly shifts into slowly falling lines, in sharp contrast to the dancers' quick, irregular movements.in one clip, a dancer is viewed from above, a series of white dots from the motion capture the only representation of the body. the result is a stunning abstraction: the body appears as a series of moving constellations.\"merce thinks of this representation as skittering water bugs,\" kaiser said.for all his design work on cunningham's biped, kaiser acknowledges that in translating the movement of a real dancer into an animated figure he has yet to capture the essence of a living being.the computer-generated part of the work was not meant to replace performers, he said.\"technology will never replace live performance,\" said kaiser. \"instead, i see our work as a new kind of filmmaking.\""}
