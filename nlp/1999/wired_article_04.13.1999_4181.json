[network solution's] customer service team should be sent back to the gulag for re-education.\"network solutions is currently the only domain-name registrar, a monopoly status it has enjoyed for several years. that's made the company soft, wrote alschuler.the solution? take its monopoly away.five new firms are slated to begin signing up domain names along with network solutions beginning in may, when the company's monopoly contract with the government expires.\"competition for [network solutions] is lurking in the nearby wings,\" alschuler wrote. \"and we, for one, can't wait.\""}
