(schillinger maintains world sports is breaking no laws, because all the gambling actually takes place on a server in antigua, where games of chance are perfectly legal.) senator jon kyl (r-arizona) is sponsoring a bill that promises to crack down on folks operating gambling sites offshore or on, but, so far at least, no one is actively targeting individual bettors.world sports exchange:new moneysports futurestaking stock of optionslook ma, no tellersquotemaking the grade"}
