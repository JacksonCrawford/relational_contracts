are you using hate speech or not? and gay people can use 'faggot' in a friendly way in their profiles but black people can't.\"according to david goldman, president of hatewatch.org, an online anti-hate group, aol's problem is not an anti-gay bias, but its unwillingness to enforce its service contract, which explicitly prohibits hate speech.\"instead of trying to justify blocking certain words over other words, they need to have a public debate over what constitutes hate speech,\" goldman said. \"they need to have a consistent terms of service policy instead of indulging in this type of linguistic calisthenics.\"civil rights groups want companies like aol to actively monitor for anti-hate content, but it's a responsibility that aol finds difficult to shoulder. \"it's physically and technically impossible to screen in advance,\" said d'amato. \"we have to rely on the community to inform us of violations.\"but aol's disclaimers receive little credence among civil rights activists, primarily due to a 1997 incident when the company refused to remove a kkk site on the grounds that it wasn't \"hateful or inciteful.\" their anti-hate policy was incorporated into the terms of service contract after that incident.\"we know that hate is difficult to monitor,\" said goldman. \"what we're asking for is a certain public honesty. we know certain issues are gray, but they haven't dealt with any of it.\"despite aol's stringent policies on content, it is relatively easy to find pornographic or racist content in their member profiles, chatrooms, and web sites. but d'amato does not view this as a failure of aol's system of enforcement.\"we routinely shut people down. in fact, one person's profile said they'd had action on their account seven times. that shows it's working,\" said d'amato.but some activists view these type of statements as just more aol doubletalk. \"they're grabbing at straws to defend themselves,\" said aravosis. \"like they say in law school, they're rearranging the deck chairs on the titanic. let's face it, aol's hate policy has sunk.\"other established civil rights groups like the anti-defamation league are more cautious in condemning anti-hate policies of private companies like aol.\"our stance is that these companies are allowed to set their own policy,\" said adl spokesman jordan kessler. \"aol has set up an anti-hate policy, and we can only encourage them to actually enforce it.\"kessler points to the communications decency act which grants immunity for isp providers. under this act, private companies like aol are not liable for content on their site, but are free to set their own regulations regarding content.\"the ball's in their court. they can choose to monitor hate speech or not. they're under no obligation to have rules or to enforce them,\" said kessler.\"in terms of calling [aol] hypocrites or attacking them, that's not where we want to be. at least aol has done something. they have an anti-hate policy.\""}
