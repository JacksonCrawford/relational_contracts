(a print version from perseus books is forthcoming this fall.) it may well be the work that finally fulfills dubois' long-deferred dream and, in turn, educates the next generation of world citizens.encarta africana: $69.95. microsoft: (877) 362 2374, encarta.msn.com/africana.street credjoystick to the cosmosmacsimum overdrivecritical massvid kid with big-screen aspirationsthe web's executive assistantfeed your headsatellites can waitkidcammusicjust outta betareadmethe name gamehands-free home accessout of africamutant killing spreelarger than lifecontributors"}
