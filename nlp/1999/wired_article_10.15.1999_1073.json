somebody's got to be there with those people.\"culhane acknowledges the risk of discrimination, noting that some programs in philadelphia will turn away homeless people with a history of violence. those turned away can appeal.the seattle council's grow offers assurances that safe harbor, still in early planning, will be carefully crafted to prevent abuses.meanwhile, third-party privacy groups will be keeping a close watch.\"we're concerned about it,\" said doug honig, washington state's aclu education director. \"we want to know, how is the information going to be used, who will it be shared with, and what are the safeguards?\"all parties agree on one thing: the problem of homelessness is enormous and growing and something has to be done.\"no one really understands how serious this issue is,\" said the union gospel mission's wippel. \"homelessness is an epidemic. it's a real catastrophe.\""}
