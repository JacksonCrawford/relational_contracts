by tracking sports stats for fantasy-league gms. by john gartner.", "author": "john gartner", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "04.05.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "every sports fan has idols. but, even more than wanting to be mark mcgwire or sammy sosa, millions of fantasy league addicts want to own them on their rotisserie teams. the official start of the baseball season will see millions going online for their daily fix of who's hot and who's not. the insatiable craving for stats on demand and player news has launched a big-league e-commerce industry among steinbrenner wannabes.rotisserie, or roto, baseball is named for the new york eatery where the game was conceived. it allows fans to play out their fantasies by letting them choose their own player rosters. points are awarded on the basis of player statistics.the team with the highest points -- for hits, runs, home runs, stolen bases, and runs batted in for hitters, and victories, innings pitched, saves, and strikeouts for pitchers -- wins. players are assigned dollar values based on their prospects for the upcoming year. they're drafted at the start of the year and can be traded or released during the season.nearly every portal player and sports news publisher offers fantasy leagues, providing free and fee-based services to track the stats that let friends, neighbors, and frat brothers compete. espn, cnn/sports illustrated, netcenter, cbs sportsline, and yahoo are among the dozens of sites charging virtual owners up to us$50 per team to manage their player statistics.\"fantasy games are the fast growing percentage of espn's revenue,\" said patrick keane, an analyst at jupiter communications. keane said that espn nets between $6 million and $7 million per year from fantasy games, a business the network entered in 1995. \"their database management makes it so much easier for espn to service the casual and fantasy gamer.\"online fantasy games make money from the advertising surrounding free games -- where players compete against each other worldwide for prizes -- and from the league management fees that let friends compete against each other for bragging rights .msnbc will give away nearly $400,000 in prizes during its 1999 baseball fantasy contest to try and attract visitors. espn will award a 32-inch tv at the end of the baseball season, in addition to its weekly giveaways.each new sports season sees more than 100 percent growth in participation, according to jim mcgee, who runs the fantasy games for espn. mcgee said over 450,000 people joined espn's ncaa basketball tournament game in just four days. espn last week announced an agreement with the nhl to co-develop fantasy games and real-time boxscores for the diehards. espn has similar arrangements with the nfl, nba, and nascar, and also recently added a golf fantasy game.\"we drive a lot of traffic to the site and fill a distribution need for espn.com,\" said mcgee. the 30 free fantasy games on espn have not had trouble attracting major sponsors, winning deals with pizza hut, ford, and microsoft.although the prizes are strong incentives to play, competition, especially against people you know, is the real motivator. \"i bet we could take away all of the prizes, and it wouldn't affect our business dramatically,\" said mcgee.in addition to the volume of eyeballs and subsequent ad dollars that free fantasy games bring in, web sites are seeing an upsurge in demand for customized pay services. services are hitting the sweet spot with managed leagues that pit friends against one another, charging from $20-50 per team for the stats.\"the change in our league since moving online has been staggering,\" said dave steinberger, whose eight-year-old league went digital three years ago. steinberger was happy to let usa stats compile the numbers because it gives him more time to check boxscores and read about injuries.steinberger said he spends about 10 hours per week tracking his team, and he and his fellow managers have joked about roto being more important than biological needs. \"if our wives told us we'd have to give up sex or rotisserie from april to october, we'd stick with roto.\"web sites are eyeing an additional market for customized services for the manager who wants every advantage. roto news has a daily email service for $9.95 that lets you track up to 100 players. espn's mcgee said the company is considering adding pay-for newsletters with scouting advice from their columnists, as well as player transaction services that alert owners when a player gets injured, traded, or released.a more recent twist on fantasy games has a wall street flavor. sites such as wall street sports simulate the stock market and let managers trade shares based on the value of athletes in all sports.player values fluctuate according to performance and health. for example, eric lindros' value plummeted 13 percent on friday when it was discovered that the philadelphia flyers star center had a collapsed lung and would miss the remainder of the season."}
