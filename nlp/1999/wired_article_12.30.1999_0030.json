it's not a computer game in a pc sense. everybody has a character and it's a little toy. it's our way to express that what we see as the battlefield isn't just war in the common sense, it's not just aggressive.\"music will also be included. in fact, etoy plans to release a cd in the coming weeks that will both call attention to its fight with etoys and help raise money for a legal defense fund to offset what the group says is more than $50,000 in legal costs so far.\"for our music project, we asked friends and musicians to produce lullabies,\" zai said. \"at the moment we have 20 or 30 lullabies. we just finished the first cd. it's called lullabies for toywar.com. people will laugh, and it's a good way to collect money.\"negativland will be on there. they are a real legend. they contributed a very nice song called 'clowns and ballerinas,' with a little girl singing about clowns and lollipops. it's just totally insane.\"potentially more controversial will be a game of \"spies,\" conveying information etoy members consider damaging to etoys. etoys does in fact sell toy world war ii german soldiers, identified either as \"wehrmacht\" or \"waffen-ss\" depending on which branch of service it represents.their uniforms are notably free of any nazi insignia, at least based on the picture shown at the web site. but as etoy well knows, certain topics are guaranteed to generate firestorms of controversy. to imply that selling historically detailed replicas of german soldiers somehow advocates nazism may be a bit of a stretch, however.\"they cannot avoid something like that, because it is our right to document all these activities,\" zai said. \"we are very careful that we don't use illegal things. if someone places a link to embarrassing things, that's our right to use that. we can say we will remove the word 'fuck' if you remove your nazi toys.\"he protested etoys' decision to take its case to the media. ironically, etoy had found success in its own media campaign but had, in recent days, followed truax's advice and toned down that aspect of its defense.\"it's obvious that it's a pr move,\" zai said. \"they saw the damage being done to their company. before we even really had a chance to think about the things they suggested, they went to the press, and that's not a good way to find an agreement.\"they sent us a statement and at the same time they were calling everyone. this was not a good move. that's the first sign that there is something to hide. in our eyes this is a manipulation, or they would carefully hold back this information from the press and try to find a solution. if they really feel sorry about what they did, they can apologize.\""}
