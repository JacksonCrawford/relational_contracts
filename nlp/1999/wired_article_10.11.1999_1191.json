that used music and the internet to fight global poverty. netaid -- organized by the united nations development program (undp) and internet networking company cisco systems -- was watched or heard by millions on television, radio, and on a web site that organizers hoped would lure millions to see the show. for most web cast viewers -- equipped with ordinary modems -- footage from the london concert was like watching the shaky output from a slow-motion security camera.the sheer volume of internet users also slowed the system, making pictures grainy and slowing transmission time, said thomas ritstetter, a spokesman for kpmg consulting, which set up the web site.\"perhaps it may be a little ambitious to use internet technology at this point,\" ritstetter told the associated press. \"but the incentive of using the internet is to get people to make a live donation.\"the webcast sustained a few brownouts due to heavy usage in some areas, including parts of california and new york, but it generally avoided the kinds of capacity problems faced by the notorious victoria's secret fashion show, which many viewers were unable to access because of congested lines.netaid organizers said 60 countries aired the concert on tv and 132 nations had it on radio -- a record.douglas graham, a kpmg spokesman, called it the largest webcast in internet history, surpassing the previous mark of 12,500 simultaneous viewers, far short of the system's capacity of 125,000.officials said the exact figures on the number of people accessing the webcast and using the web site to make donations would be released in the coming days. |the concert was staged in three venues hosting overlapping performances, starting at wembley stadium in london and later moving to the palais des nations, the home of the united nations in geneva, and finally to giants stadium in east rutherford, new jersey, outside new york.musicians included the re-united rock duo the eurythmics, who opened the show in london, george michael and pete townshend, wyclef jean of the fugees, bono of the irish rock group u2, sting, sheryl crow, singer bryan ferry, rap singer puff daddy, and south african band ladysmith black mambazo.despite a feel-good atmosphere, some artists warned against the \"we are the world\" naivete that their efforts would reduce poverty overnight. although that movement by top musicians spawned a hit record and raised cash in the mid-1980s its success was not sustained.\"nothing cataclysmic and positive is ever simple,\" michael stipe, singer for rock group rem, told reuters on his way off the giants stadium stage. \"but i think this is a great idea and perhaps we can get there.\"annan, speaking from the palais des nations, urged virtual viewers to click on \"give\" to make an online donation.soon the global village will have 6 billion inhabitants, annan said, but \"nearly half of them will have to survive on us$2 a day or less.... now every one of us can help change it, with a click of the mouse.... there are no more excuses. let's bring on a new day.\"annan spoke to a live, invitation-only audience in geneva that included actor michael douglas, who made an appeal for peace, and cisco president john chambers.\"tonight, we take a giant step to solve an impossible problem -- to eliminate in the next decade extreme poverty,\" said chambers, whose company provided about us$22 million to netaid and advanced the project another $5 million, money that will be refunded, to cover the costs of the concert.chambers said the power of the internet had transformed business globally. now it was time to use it to transform philanthropy.\"that same power is now available to refocus the goodwill of mankind, to eliminate poverty now, and forever,\" chambers said. \"let this be the legacy that the first internet generation leaves for our children. the power to eliminate poverty is now online. log on, get involved, stay involved.\"speaking backstage at giant stadium, robert piper, manager of the netaid site for undp, said: \"our focus is not really just raising money. we're looking for long-term engagement and commitment. if people could donate one day every month it would have quite an impact.\"music stars performing in other venues said they were impressed with the concert's networking.\"my opinion about the internet early on was that it did away with the idea of community,\" said crow, who performed in giants stadium. \"now i think it's a way to reach out to the rest of the community.\"rapper wyclef jean, who came to brooklyn, new york, from haiti as a child, said he was supporting the site because it contained a section dedicated to helping refugees. wyclef and bono performed \"new day,\" a song wyclef wrote for netaid to offer hope to poor children. reuters contributed to this report."}
