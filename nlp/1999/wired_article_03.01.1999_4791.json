(the latter is now a unit of compaq.)the government alleged that intel forced the companies to turn over valuable technology patents that could otherwise have boosted competition in the markets for chips or related parts of personal computers.the case goes to trial before an ftc administrative-law judge on 9 march. the antitrust trial of microsoft, the world's leading software maker, went into recess last week.for more than a decade, intel has been the dominant supplier of processors for personal computers, collecting more than 80 percent of the revenues and billions in profits. but since the ftc complaint was filed last year, chip competitors advanced micro devices and national semiconductor's cyrix unit have made great strides in stealing business from intel in popular low-end computers costing under us$1,000.in monday's filing, the ftc dismissed the importance of the shift at the low end. the agency said the market segment was a tiny part of the overall market and argued that amd and cyrix gained largely because intel had ignored the cheaper computers.\"it is questionable whether amd and cyrix can maintain their recent gains,\" the ftc said. after seeing the success of other firms, \"intel took aggressive steps to capture the new segment and is widely expected dramatically to gain share in the low-end segments.\"similarly, small, well-publicized chip start-ups like transmeta and metaflow will not restrain intel's ability to monopolize the market, the ftc said. \"these firms exert no competitive influence on intel.\"much of the ftc's brief was not publicly released, including portions about the new chip start-ups, intel's current market share, and the prices it charges personal computer makers for its chips. ftc officials were not immediately available to comment, but often sensitive information obtained by regulators is not disclosed in court filings.despite reports in recent weeks that the ftc might broaden its case to include other charges, the agency stuck to the three allegations made in its june brief. it said intel forced compaq and digital to turn over important technology patents by threatening to withhold crucial information it shares with all its customers about upcoming chips.in the intergraph case, intel allegedly made the same threats, but a federal district court ruled that intel had to continue sharing the information with intergraph.copyright"}
