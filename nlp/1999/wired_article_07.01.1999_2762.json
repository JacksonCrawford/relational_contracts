(hint: fantasy or cartoon violence.)although much touted by federal regulators and embraced by president clinton and vice president gore, the only people who seem to be benefiting from the v-chip are washington politicians. manufacturers are not touting it and circuit city's detailed list of features on new tvs doesn't mention it.\"this is purely a political sop,\" says barry steinhardt, associate director of the american civil liberties union.\"politicians want to claim they're doing something about the problem of violence in america by attacking the media and by offering solutions which, it turns out, american families won't have any great interest in.\"steinhardt said the aclu is considering a legal challenge to the government-backed requirements that networks rate their shows in a way the v-chip can understand.\"we are involved in discussions about the possibility of filing a lawsuit,\" he said. he also said possible clients would be show creators who feel that the ratings stifle their free-speech rights.to be sure, polls have indicated that americans want a device that can shield their children from harmful content. the v-chip comes from telecommunications act of 1996, which pressured the broadcasting industry to develop the rating system. the fcc then required tv manufacturers to include it in new sets.it isn't the chip that particularly irks its opponents. rather, they take issue with the rating system.\"the technical aspect of the v-chip isn't all that troublesome,\" says robert corn-revere, a lawyer at hogan and hartson who is formerly fcc chief counsel. \"the troublesome part is having the government dictate through law or heavily politicized arm-twisting what that rating system ought to be.\"and if consumers really wanted this technology, might broadcasters and manufacturers have done it on their own?\"i think that the so-called public interest in this sort of thing was ginned up by activist groups and a few members of congress looking for a headline,\" said paul mcmasters, first amendment ombudsman at the freedom forum.its backers say it's too early to declare the v-chip a flop.\"i object when people already declare the v-chip a failure, or say that parents just don't care about the v-chip,\" tristani said.\"i tell them: the v-chip has just arrived today. give it a chance.\""}
