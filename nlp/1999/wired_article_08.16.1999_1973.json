tape measure to produce perfectly tailored menswear. steve kettmann reports from berlin.", "author": "steve kettmann", "category": "science", "type": "article", "timestamp": "08.16.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "berlin -- it all started with miss germany. early this year, hans schlachter -- a self-professed recovering day trader -- was watching a german tv program that showed a company using lasers to get the beauty queen's exact measurements.schlachter and his partner bettina hoppe, a commercial photographer, decided they could use the same technique to produce fine men's suits that would fit better than anything most men have seen. the result is cut for you, which opened last week in berlin's fashionable mitte district.\"people come in to the shop and say, 'where have you been a tailor?' and i tell them, 'nowhere,'\" schlachter explained , looking very tailor-like with a tape measure slung around the shoulders of his elegant gray suit.\"we think what we do will make the future. our style of fashion means we take the measurements of your body and take what is best and work with that. what we do is a correction of normal faults.\"every second person has a difference of between one and two centimeters in the height of their shoulders, for example. very often there is a difference in length of one arm or one leg. our goal should be to hide those little faults.\"neither schlachter nor hoppe does the tailoring. that's taken care of at a workshop near frankfurt, where traditional tailors receive the mound of information emailed to them on each client and use it to whip up a suit. prices range from 800 to 1,200 dm (us$430 to $650).heinz fanselau, who has worked for the berlin mayor's office on sister-city programs long enough to remember sam yorty's career as mayor of los angeles in the '60s, was tickled to death at the whole procedure.the computer screen just outside the imaging room showed two images of him: one frontal, the other sideways. a network of black lines traced the contours of his body. one extended from his toes to the top of his head, another started at the small of his back and ended at his belly -- which heinz was good enough not to suck in, the way many clients do.\"it was very new for me, getting measured this way, but very comfortable and easy, and better i think than with a tape measure,\" he said. \"i very often eat at a nearby italian restaurant, cinque, and the owner looked at me one night and said, 'you need some new clothes,' so here i am.\"business is not booming just yet, in part because july is the month for people to flee berlin. but the sleek, mod shop near the newly opened reichstag draws plenty of curious looks from passersby.that might be because of the 15-meter-high blue tie stuck on the outside of the six-story building. \"it costs a lot of money, and nobody is looking,\" schlachter said. \"we want to put a floodlight on the wall across the street, but unfortunately we have no idea who owns the land.\"or it might be the minimalist look of the shop itself. other than a few books of fabric samples, a compact rack of 30 men in black suits (to test the laser measurements), and a few ties stuck here and there, the place has the spartan look of a high-tech start-up.the heart of the shop is in a mid-sized back room, painted white to help the light sensors pick up digital information.\"you only look in the little camera across the room in each of the two positions we diagram for you, and that's all,\" schlachter said. \"the rest is software.\"schlachter and hoppe are quick-on-their-feet, charming salespeople who look as though they'd fit right in at any power lunch. they talk of eventually franchising cut for you, and you believe they just might.but there is also an element of wild-eyed, visionary fun to their shop. the artwork -- full-sized, rough-texture sculptures of a woman's and a man's body -- was surprisingly interesting for a clothes shop, and spoke to an interest in the body that goes beyond commerce.\"you have no fashion dictates,\" schlachter said. \"fashion might tell you big shoulders one year, small shoulders the next. we have clients tell us exactly what they want. one button. two buttons. three buttons. what sort of lapel. exactly what they want.\"mostly, cut for you battles what might be called the helmut kohl effect. kohl lasted a generation as germany's political leader, and picture after picture showed his suits bunching up on top of his hearty gut. when schlachter stands up so that hoppe can show how she studies a client, to make sure he's not hiding anything she points to his stomach.\"the problem is he is helmut kohl,\" she said. \"he's slouching forward.\"cut for you is one of only a handful of its kind in europe, and could very well usher in the clothes-making of the future -- both in terms of ease for the customer and the sense of customized design battling the tyranny of corporate-backed fashion trends.but it's also a business, and knows its audience. the shop opened a few hundred meters from friedrichstrasse, the central boulevard of berlin where marlene dietrich used to sing and italian shoe companies now rule. the christian democrats have their headquarters nearby, and so do other political parties. there are so many construction cranes huddled together in the area, it looks like they're choosing sides for a little pickup basketball.\"why here?\" schlachter asks rhetorically. \"we are very near to everyone in berlin who wears suits. in this part of town, people normally wear suits.\""}
