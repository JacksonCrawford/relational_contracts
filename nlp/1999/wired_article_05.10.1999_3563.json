face the legacy of their past every day, but the 10th of may always brings an extra dose of national introspection, marking as it does the first large-scale book burnings by nazi students in 1933. this year, the anniversary has been getting extra attention because of an installation by american-born berlin artist sheryl oring, who makes the most of the symbolic power of the clunky old manual typewriter today with an art installation called writer's block.oring has set up 21 cages, one meter square, of rusty metal on the bebelplatz, just off the unter den linden. it was here in 1933 that students from adjacent humboldt university, egged on by the revolutionary national socialist government, built a huge bonfire and threw books deemed \"un-german\" into the flames.\"they took joy in it,\" the new york times reported the next day, noting that joseph goebbels, hitler's propaganda minister, showed up on the bebelplatz that night to declare: \"jewish intellectualism is dead. national socialism has hewn the way. the german folk soul can again express itself. these flames do not only illuminate the final end of the old era, they also light up the new.\"tonight, original music and dance will cap off a day intended to make people look at the past -- and at the limits on free expression that remain a huge problem around the world.\"a month ago, in early april, there was a book burning in belgrade,\" oring said. \"the 1933 book burning was very early after the nazis took over. very early they tried to take away freedom of thought. it's scary to think that the same thing is happening now, and people don't even know about it.\"all but one of the writer's block cages are stuffed with black metal typewriters from the years before world war ii, some of them from germany, some of them used to type out the orders that sent people to the concentration camps. the 21st cage, which forms the point of a triangle facing under den linden, contains only one small typewriter inside a second, smaller cage. a close look at the keyboard shows that hitting shift and \"5\" types out the ss symbol, the twin lightning bolts that have become synonymous with evil. \"mostly i just wanted to call attention to it and make people really look at it,\" oring said, standing near her installation. \"all of these typewriters in some ways raise questions. the ss typewriter is a really blatant reminder about what happened at that time, and it's the only one i have. it was illegal to have them after the war. we got this machine from prague.\"a moment later, oring pointed to some activity around the cage with the special typewriter.\"i think people respond to the project on a lot of different levels,\" she said. \"right now, there are a bunch of kids looking at the typewriters and touching them. kids love them, because they haven't seen them. actually, right now the kids are typing on the ss machine, so i guess they've figured out what it is.\"earlier today, i was talking to a woman in her 80s who was alive for the book-burnings, so for her the cages were very powerful.\"the project has generated considerable interest in berlin, where the past remains a touchy subject. local newspapers and tv stations have followed the project's progress as it moved from bold idea (oring was often told \"you're crazy\") to reality, helped by donations from among others, daimlerchrysler, which lent a mercedes. the still-vacant checkpoint charlie office building, next to the landmark border between old east and west berlin, donated the space for the studio where the cages were constructed and more than 600 typewriters collected, 525 of them used in the installation.some germans dislike the idea of an american artist challenging berliners with a political project that forces them to reflect on 1933. but others welcome it, believing that it heralds a return to the cosmopolitanism that characterized berlin in the 1920s.\"it's very important that in the last days of the millennium, an american came to the former east berlin to show that global history is one,\" said guenther schaefer, the german artist whose image of a star of david superimposed on the german flag appears on the east side gallery, a preserved section of the berlin wall now devoted to art (and, one might add, tourism). newsweek put the powerful image, which has been defaced more than 20 times, on the cover of its european edition last year. \"this action here in bebelplatz is a bridge between the past and the new berlin after the wall crumbled,\" schaefer said.sonja ernst, a graduate student in international relations at the berlin's free university, worked long hours on the project as an assistant. she said she was drawn to writer's block not only because she finds the cages both beautiful and meaningful, but also because as a german she's thankful for another chance to reflect.\"to me it's very important that people from other countries are doing something with our history, because they are more objective and it's very important for germans to get more ideas about this and more insights,\" ernst said.\"that's above all true for this part of our history, because we are paralyzed by our feelings of guilt somehow, so it's important for people to come here who aren't feeling guilty. for germans, it's something else.\"for me, i know that my grandparents did not support the nazis but they also didn't do anything against them,\" ernst said. \"people today say they were neutral, but i think there is no such thing as neutral on the nazis.\"as if to underscore her point, a neo-nazi organization plans to march past the bebelplatz monday evening. violence is considered unlikely, but hundreds of police will be deployed just in case. should violence occur, however, it would only help get the message across, since it would ensure even larger-scale media coverage in germany.after berlin, oring plans to take the installation on the road, naming budapest, washington, and istanbul as likely stops in the near future. later, she hopes to go to havana, cuba, and to tiananman square in beijing.the installation not only stimulates discussion but leaves a profound impression on its viewers, as evidenced by the range of emotions passing across people's faces.\"people seem interested and somehow confused, because they don't know exactly what it is,\" ernst said. \"the confusion is good, because then you have to think about it. if it's clear at once, then you don't.\"one hallmark of the project has been the large number of people who have taken part in it, most for no pay. volunteers, who have helped with such unglamorous tasks as cleaning decades-old grit from typewriters, have come not only from germany but from around the world -- sweden to sudan, turkey to paraguay.the checkpoint charlie studio had the bustle of an open salon in the weeks leading up to 10 may, with people dropping in when they could to do what they could to move things along. participants said they came away from the experience with a heightened sense of what's important.\"people think 'there is nothing i can do, so why do anything?'\" said oring, a former wired news contributor and san francisco chronicle assistant city editor. \"but this project has become something people can be part of. people can donate a typewriter or help clean a typewriter and they contribute to a project that has become so big, it's almost like a social-movement type project.\"the internationalism of the effort -- dancers joined in from taiwan, israel, germany, and the united states (with american sommer ulrickson doing the choreography) -- adds to the sense of tapping into something larger.\"my contribution with the music i composed for the project is about time,\" said american composer ari benjamin meyers, whose opera about julius and ethel rosenberg has its world premiere this december in the german city of magdeburg. \"book burnings have always happened, and will happen. we will repeat it. art can tell you something about big issues that you can't get by reading about it in a book. it can give you a perspective that stays with you.\""}
