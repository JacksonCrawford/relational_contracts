undetected and deadly. but there it is, on the screens of the carrier's combat information center: bright as a lighthouse, soon to be dead as a duck.its flitting radar trace has been picked up by other ships in the battle group, beamed wirelessly in realtime to the carrier and assembled by millions of lines of software code into a precise target.boom. dead duck.chalk one up for \"cooperative engagement capability,\" the navy's newfound ability to share real-time sensor data between ships hundreds of miles apart. and just one small aspect of a technological revolution that's sweeping the seas.say hello to the way-new, network-centric navy.\"this is a radical, dramatic transformation,\" said richard danzig, secretary of the navy, a former harvard professor and rhodes scholar.the navy is following the business world into the information age. it's two years into a massive technology upgrade called information technology-21, designed to connect the navy's far-flung dots into one cohesive information system. completion is scheduled for 2003.the implications are profound for every aspect of the navy, from strategy to logistics to a military culture accustomed to top-down hierarchies, in which a few officers mete out information to the masses.\"it stands everything on its head,\" said vice admiral arthur cebrowski, president of the naval warfare college and architect of the navy's \"network-centric warfare\" strategy.shared information is the foundation of the strategy: collect as much information from as many disparate sources as possible and share it with everyone -- at every level. in theory, that leads to a smart, flexible navy that can adapt instantly to changing battle conditions.cebrowski uses unmilitary terms like \"self-synchronization\" and \"self-organization\" to describe the behavior of a networked navy. the commander sets the parameters for his autonomous subordinates and monitors their actions. but he's freed from having to constantly pass down command decisions based on information only he has.\"it used to be that the senior people decided what it was that you needed to know. the information was metered to you,\" cebrowski said. \"but the modern warfighter has to be able to craft his own information domain. you have to give a person information systems commensurate with the power of the weapon in his hand.\"the hope of the networked navy is that its forces will make smart choices so quickly that they preempt enemy moves, rather than reacting to them.\"the old-fashioned notion is to generate a lot of smoking holes, kill a lot of people, break a lot of things,\" cebrowski said. \"the promise of network-centric warfare is that you can get an enemy to change his behavior without your firing a shot.\"you can also improve the morale of sailors weaned in the social climate of the information age.\"one of the attractions of the information revolution is that it moves us away from a top heavy structure,\" secretary danzig said. \"information acts like a force of gravity that pulls the decision-making power lower into the organization -- one that has more freedom, flexibility, and vibrancy. the gravitational pull is toward greater freedom and flexibility for junior personnel, and i think that's very healthy.\"theoretically, a networked navy is also one that puts fewer sailors in harm's way.already, administrative jobs like personnel records and pay management are being moved off ships to shore stations. instead of a bursar on every ship, there may be a handful in port that each handle pay for three or four ships. automation, remote maintenance, and tele-medicine promise to further trim crew size.today, a navy destroyer has 300 crew members. the navy's next-generation destroyer, designed to set sail in 2008, will be fully manned with a crew of 95. some smaller vessels might ultimately go unmanned.on a more prosaic level, the navy hopes that the web and intranets will transform its vastly complex logistics operations.\"we're an unusual enterprise in that every six months we send out 20,000 people who go halfway around the world,\" danzig said. \"we're deploying people in larger numbers to more disparate places than any other organization in the world. technology affords us extraordinary logistics advantages.\"a for-instance: the navy is phasing out its old system of buying and warehousing food for the whole fleet. instead, ships order from web-based distribution centers and chow is delivered to the piers. the money saved has allowed ships to order better quality food. the same goes for replacement parts, ordered and tracked online.the navy has also recently launched a massive web site called lifelines to help sailors manage their navy lives, from arranging base housing to financial services.\"it takes bureaucratic information out of the hands of bureaucrats,\" danzig said.it's the tip of the iceberg. the navy is developing a massive navy-marine corp intranet designed to streamline all administrative and logistics functions. \"we're talking on the order of 350,000 to 400,000 [networked computers],\" cebrowski said.while there are obvious, concrete benefits to steering the navy toward technological transformation, danzig touts a side benefit that's harder to quantify but may be more critical: change makes people think creatively.\"in the military, with such strong traditions and hierarchy\" that's vitality important, he said. it keeps it from becoming an ossified anachronism.\"it's a force for psychological change.\""}
