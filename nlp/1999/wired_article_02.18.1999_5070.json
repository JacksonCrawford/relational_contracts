that's going to come as a shock to the internet crowd.one encouraging sign: it looks like dell (dell) hit bottom after declining about 20 percent over the past three days. say what you will about the company's lower revenue, dell remains a perennial favorite, and the bargain hunters were quick to latch onto its shares as the day progressed. dell was up $1.44 at $83.international business machines (ibm) was higher as well as it announced plans to bundle the linux operating system with a number of its servers, workstations, and personal computers. ibm gained $2.63 to $173.13, while microsoft (msft), which can't be happy with any challenge to the dominance of windows, shed $5.94 to $144.06.sun microsystems (sunw) eased 6 cents to $94 even as credit suisse first boston and bear, stearns reiterated \"buy\" ratings for the company's stock. for its part, intel (intc) was up $2.69 at $127.31 as donaldson, lufkin & jenrette maintained a \"buy\" for the chipmaker.peoplesoft (psft) was breathing easier after the securities and exchange commission decided the business application maker won't have to restate past earnings because of questionable accounting practices. peoplesoft had boosted its bottom line by taking charges for research in the works by acquired firms. the sec is now in the process of tightening the policy screws to curtail such doings. peoplesoft rose 19 cents to $17.50.while most internet stocks were lower, broadcast.com (bcst) resisted the downtrend with a 16 percent surge to $67.63. the company inked a deal with capitol records to create a new online music channel featuring both audio and video attractions. separately, dlj raised its rating for broadcast.com's stock to \"buy\" from \"market perform.\"affinity technology group (affi) also had wings on its heels, flying 10 percent to $2 after unveiling new e-commerce technology that allows lenders to deliver speedy loan decisions to customers via the net. it didn't hurt that affinity named the subsidiary handling this new service decisioning.com.is \"decisioning\" even a word?closer to home: lycos (lcos) fell $3.19 to $84.25 after the boston herald followed a similar story in salon speculating that the portal's $83 million takeover of wired digital, parent of wired news, may be jeopardized by a spat among wired shareholders. lycos shareholders, distracted by their company's shaky merger proposal with usa networks, may see the wired deal as more trouble than its worth, the herald reported.no one asked, but it sure seems like the whole wired-lycos-usa rodeo wasn't thought through very well. don't be surprised if some or all of the deals involved end up back at the negotiating table.at&t (t) advanced $1.50 to $85.81 after receiving a green light from federal regulators for its $57.5 billion acquisition of cable giant tele-communications inc. meanwhile, comcast (cmcsa), the no. 4 us cable company, was $4.25 higher at $67.19 after agreeing to buy greater philadelphia cablevision for approximately $264 million in stock.for a really big-bucks deal, check out transamerica (ta) being gobbled up by europe's seventh-biggest insurer, aegon, for nearly $11 billion. transamerica soared 26 percent to $72.81 on the news.lastly, special sauce all around for mcdonald's (mcd), which advanced $2.44 to $82.94 (and helped lift the dow in the process) after merrill lynch raised its 12-month price target for the burgermeister to $100. mickey d's also topped fortune's annual list of \"most admired\" food-services companies for the second straight year.must be doing something right."}
