success. now what?", "author": "reuters", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "05.17.1999 03:00 AM", "text": "new york -- at&t and mci worldcom host their annual shareholder meetings this week as stronger companies than they were a year ago. but both face big challenges to propel their surging stocks even higher, analysts said. over the past year, at&t, the no. 1 us telephone company, announced about us$120 billion in acquisitions that will allow it to reenter the local telephone market and to become the largest cable-television operator. it also shored up its international operations, improved revenue growth, cut costs, and aggressively expanded its wireless operations.mci worldcom -- the product of a merger of worldcom and mci communications -- became the no. 2 us long-distance company and strengthened its hold on the fastest growing segments of the telecommunications industry: international, data, and internet services.not bad for a year's work. but even more hard work lies ahead of them, analysts said.at&t's (t) efforts so far have surpassed even the most optimistic expectations and helped push its stock price up more than 50 percent over the past 12 months.\"in the past year, there's been a drastic turnaround in investor sentiment -- to the point that at&t is seen as a high-flying company. a year ago, people were questioning the viability of at&t. now, they are seen as invincible,\" said brian adamik, a telecommunications analyst with the yankee group.at&t's meeting wednesday in houston will mark chairman c. michael armstrong's second meeting with shareholders and will allow him to outline plans for what may be his toughest job yet -- digesting the varied acquisitions and partnerships he has forged.\"when you look down the list of things armstrong had to deal with ... he's gone down the list and checked them off, at least strategically. wall street is enamored by deals, but execution will make or break them,\" adamik said.the new york-based company is expected to spend the next year absorbing its acquisitions and wrestling with regulators over its quickly growing cable presence, said independent industry analyst jeffrey kagan.\"at&t is doing the right thing, preparing for the future, but they're amassing so much dominance in cable [that] i would be surprised if regulators didn't have a problem with that.... is it healthy for any one company to have that much power?\" he asked.at&t must still strengthen its internet operations. it may combine its small worldnet internet firm with at home, the high-speed service in which it owns a stake, and roadrunner, a similar service controlled by cable company mediaone group (which at&t plans to buy) and time warner.\"some kind of deal with at home and roadrunner is inevitable,\" said one analyst who declined to be named. other industry watchers, however, said such a deal may be snuffed out by regulatory pressure.mci worldcom, meanwhile, remains a wall street darling, with its stock up about 94 percent over the past year. it is seen as one of the best companies in the us telecommunications industry due to its strong earnings growth and its leading position in lucrative businesses such as data and international services.mci worldcom (wcom) has quickly reaped the benefits and savings of last year's merger and remains far ahead of many rivals. but the jackson, mississippi-based company still lacks a wireless-phone business, a clear consumer strategy, and a high-speed internet access service, analysts said.\"mci needs a wireless component,\" kagan said. \"they have a very strong story to tell except for wireless. it's their biggest weakness, and it could hurt them in the future. you're going to see business customers choosing their service providers on entire packages of services, and wireless is an important part of that package.\"the company lacks a wireless business at a time when an increasing amount of phone calls are being made on mobile phones instead of traditional phones. the wireless industry has seen a boom in customers, with us subscribers growing more than 25 percent in 1998 to 69.2 million, according to the cellular telecommunications industry association.mci worldcom this year walked away from two opportunities to buy wireless companies -- airtouch communications and nextel communications, but analysts said the company must have some kind of wireless service in the future.mci worldcom, which will hold its annual meeting thursday in clinton, mississippi, also needs to clarify its consumer strategy. the company has focused primarily on high-spending business customers and has become less aggressive in targeting consumers.mci worldcom cannot afford to ignore consumers at a time when many are adding more communications services -- such as high-speed internet access and electronic commerce -- in their homes, analysts said.copyright"}
