- - - -but grimberger was elated by aol europe's thursday announcement that it was not only providing german subscribers with flat-rate internet service -- a novelty here in europe -- but was doing so at the attention-grabbing, rock-bottom sum of dm9.90 (us$5.28) a month.even if deutsche telekom will still be charging by the minute for the local calls needed to access aol, grimberger and buddy chris ziegler were itching to sign up. they discussed their online proclivities just after wrapping up a two-hour chat-room session in a cybercafe two escalator flights up at kaufhof, the local version of jc penney's.\"i have a friend in berlin who has aol and sometimes i go to his place and use the internet,\" said grimberger, tugging at the black straps of the backpack he wore over his green t-shirt.\"it's good, better than here. there are more people in the chat rooms and it's not so expensive as here. we just paid 12 deutschmarks for two hours.\"we think now we want to go on the internet at home,\" grimberger said, pausing.\"with our aol,\" zeigler added eagerly, finishing his friend's thought.aol europe is not alone among the companies trying to elbow their way into a larger market share as cybertrends on the continent try to catch up with those in america. but from so-perky-you-want-to-puke meg ryan using aol in you've got mail to business headlines in german papers about microsoft and aol duking it out, steve case's baby has a little extra cachet.\"we are willing to be aggressive,\" said andreas schmidt, chief executive officer of aol europe, at a press conference leading up to saturday's opening of the nine-day international consumer electronics fair. \"i think we can take over the leadership in germany.\" it's ripe for the taking. aol europe now claims approximately 1 million users in germany, compared to 3.3 million for deutsche telekom's t-online service. paltry numbers, indeed, in a country with more than 80 million people.matt arreola, a college student from colorado visiting berlin for the summer, has had plenty of conversations with young germans about the internet. he took a break from hitting the machines at a cybercafe to sum up the landscape this way.\"the germans aren't quite as into it, first of all because they have to pay for absolutely every minute, which is a major block to surfing,\" he said. \"but i definitely think it's trendy here to get into cyber culture.\"it's not that trendy, however. over in the so-cool-it-hurts east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg -- a proud home for radicals, intellectuals, artists and all their stasi tails back in the days before the fall of the wall -- cyber-talk is more often met with a yawn. an interested yawn, but a yawn nevertheless.anne dittmer, a history student at the technical university, took a break from sharing a drink with a friend early friday afternoon to say that yes, she thought a lot of university students would take advantage of aol's cut- rate monthly plan.\"people do not email here in europe nearly as much as in the united states, but i think we are starting to catch up,\" she said. \"it's like with handys (mobile phones). three years ago on campus, almost no one had a handy. now almost everyone has one.then again, asked how often she planned to check her email once she signed up with aol, dittmer smiled and said, \"about once a month.\"early friday afternoon, karl-heinz krampitz was almost alone in his cybercafe just down the street from helmholtz platz, a part of prenzlauer berg where hip new bars are popping up like weeds.krampitz earned his phd in philosophy at moscow state university and he runs his internet cafe galerie as much as a service as a business. german-language computer magazines like tomorrow, featuring model heidi klum on the cover, are strewn around.krampitz was wowed by aol's bombshell.\"that is very, very interesting,\" he said. \"it's not good for internet cafes, but it's good for the internet.\"krampitz's machines hook up to aol germany via a tcp/ip connection, and he demonstrated the look of the german version. the basics are the same, though the aol logo is different. it's more elongated and modernistic.\"i think many people will reactivate their accounts,\" he said. \"three years ago when we started the cafe, a lot of people were connected to aol. but it was too high a price. people would cancel their accounts because they couldn't pay the bills. \"subscribers to aol's german service get access to instant messaging (\"telegramm schicken,\" reads the instructions) and buddy lists (\"meine buddies ).\"aol has a good chat setup,\" said krampitz. \"it's well done, and there is a good community.\""}
