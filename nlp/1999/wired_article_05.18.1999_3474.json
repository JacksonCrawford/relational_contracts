from around the world, in hopes that they'll learn to respect other cultures. by judy democker.", "author": "judy democker", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "05.18.1999 03:00

is a collaboration of schools online, i*earn, and the world links for development, a program of the world bank institute.together, the three educational groups hope to give students from diverse backgrounds equal access to technology and information resources. the group will also encourage children to build relationships with people outside their own cultures. that, said a schools online spokesperson, is probably the most important idea behind the alliance, and the one that will take the longest to achieve.\"the idea is that if kids become familiar with other parts of the world, they'll be less likely to drop bombs on them when they grow up,\" said janine firpo, a business consultant for schools online.the well-funded trio has begun expanding operations that provide technological resources to schools in africa, the americas, and the middle east. each group brings its unique expertise to the table.schools online specializes in wiring schools in remote regions such as rural appalachia and areas of argentina, chile, china, poland, and romania.world links works with government agencies and private companies to match up resources with economically deprived schools in the united states and around the world, and it provides computer skills training for teachers.i*earn manages educational resources for teachers, including web-based chat rooms and forums to help them develop collaborative projects for students. it also conducts follow-up monitoring to ensure that schools continue to make the most of their equipment and their web access.the alliance has a plan for building a computer-based infrastructure in regions where electricity, phone lines, and web servers may be in short supply. the group first establishes itself in a community by setting up a cluster of schools around a resource center, a lab containing 10 to 15 net-connected computers.the lab also serves as a meeting place where teachers swap project ideas and lesson plans. through the center, the alliance connects with the community, providing computer and web access to businesses and institutions for a modest fee.the plan has worked well so far. in uganda, fees charged for email, web access, and computer training courses help defray costs of web service and phone access, which can be prohibitive in less-developed countries.\"in uganda, internet access is not free,\" said victoria kisaakye, a biology and computer science teacher at the lubiri secondary school in uganda, in an email interview. \"we have to pay the server providers like infocomm, as well as domain providers. the telephone line costs about $100 per month. but at the end of it all, when more people pay, we get profits out of it all.\" in regions with scant access to books, newspapers, and television, these computer labs can bring vast informational resources into the classroom: music, movie clips, and news from around the world. and the computer skills that the students learn will help them compete for jobs and build businesses.collaborative projects have already helped students dispel some of the myths about life in other countries. one favorite cultural exchange project has students in different countries interviewing one another about their everyday lives. they then share answers, some of them surprising.\"the student in chicago learns that no, teenagers in senegal don't live in mud huts and don't eat leaves, and the student in senegal learns that kids in chicago don't have schools full of gangsters and guns,\" said linda mcginnis, co-director of the world links program.the project teaches kids how to use the internet as a research tool, while exercising their critical thinking.\"they found out that some of the stuff you find on the net is true, and some of it isn't,\" mcginnis said.teachers have found that students become more engaged when they can connect with real people in real places. children enjoy having email pals across the world.the alliance will use its cluster approach to wire remote regions of africa, in uganda, south africa, mozambique, and zimbabwe. in the americas, the alliance is targeting less-developed regions of brazil, peru, paraguay, and mexico. in the middle east, the group hopes to connect israel, palestine, egypt, lebanon, and jordan. but as mcginnis points out, access to technology does not automatically lead to better schools, better learning, or a better understanding of life beyond a country's border.\"in the us in particular, we don't know enough about the world beyond our borders,\" mcginnis said. \"but you present kids with an opportunity to talk to kids at the other side of the world, and they jump at the chance.\""}
