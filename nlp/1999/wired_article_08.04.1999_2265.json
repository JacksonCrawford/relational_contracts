(because the last few pages of the brief don't count toward the court's length limit, highlighting the rest of the document and then doing a word count is commonplace.)the court suggested a workaround for lawyers: open a new window, copy the footnotes into it, and then do a separate word count. \"then they must add the text and footnote counts manually in order to determine compliance with rule 32(a)(7).\"\"this is a reminder of how integrated law has become with computer technology,\" said eugene volokh, a law professor at ucla. \"lawyers in this competitive process try to push the envelope of the game in a lot of ways: asking for new remedies, asking for new torts, and now asking for new fonts. this is another dimension in the competitive process.\"until microsoft upgrades word, the appeals court has ordered its clerk's office to spot-check legal documents prepared with the program and count words by hand: \"counsel who use word are not entitled to a litigating advantage over those who use wordperfect.\""}
