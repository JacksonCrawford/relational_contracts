voicemail, pager, email, personal assistant - shields him from having to respond to most of them. but one day, while doerr was hiking in colorado, a caller got through with a low-cost internet-access idea. he wanted to know what doerr would make of a wireless, hand-cranked device that would let people in the remotest regions of the earth - say, the sahara - log on for free. not the sort of thing a superstar venture capitalist spends a lot of time thinking about, but this idea got doerr's attention. \"why not?\" he recalls thinking. \"i mean, imagine! that knocked me out of my chair.\"al gore was on the line.doerr resorts to this story not once, but twice, to make a point: why can't people see al gore the way he does? how can they not recognize that behind the stodgy facade there's a dreamer who believes in the transformative power of technology?\"what could be boring about a candidate who says, 'i've been using the palm vii, and here's what works and here's what doesn't,' and then goes to 'what's the right policy to get broad, ubiquitous, wireless service for our country?'\" asks doerr. then he breathlessly answers his own question. \"that's anything other than boring. that's exciting.\"john doerr, the golden prince of kleiner perkins caufield & byers, silicon valley's preeminent venture capital firm, is pretty good at picking winners. but talk to him about gore and you realize there's something else: doerr is a salesman. he believes in his product. by the time he's done with his pitch, you, too, will want to invest in the 45th vice president of the united states.\"people might call him stiff, they might call him geeky, they might call him abstract,\" doerr concedes. the market risk is not insignificant. \"but the fundamentals of this man are solid. he's really smart. he's well trained for the job. if i was going to back an entrepreneur for a risky venture, the first thing i'd do is pick a ruthlessly intellectual, honest leader who listens well and is decisive.\"al gore has come to california roughly once a month for the last six and half years. he's met countless times with doerr, with internet industry leaders including netscape's marc andreessen, halsey minor of cnet, yahoo!'s jerry yang, and kim polese of marimba, with biotech executives like genentech ceo arthur levinson. he's visited some companies, including cisco systems and cnet, so often he might as well have his own key to the men's room. to say gore \"gets it\" is like saying bill bradley knows how to play basketball.which makes it all the more awkward that the product, after years of beta-testing, launched and promptly hit the skids. doerr's hero started to falter awkwardly even before the competition swept in. now, as the 2000 campaign accelerates, the political benefits from gore's hundreds of hours of face time with the geeks are anything but obvious. by traditional standards, gore should have branded the valley by now. instead, he finds himself in a scramble for market share with the rest of the pack. they are all here: bradley, george w. bush, john mccain, steve forbes, and an overeager herd of congressional candidates, most with a tin cup in one hand and an ode to the brash young captains of the new economy in the other.in many ways, gore confronts the classic first mover's nightmare. he courted the geeks long before it was politically fashionable or profitable; now he must find a way to distinguish himself as fast followers swarm his once pristine domain. \"if gore takes the position of being a technovisionary, he paints himself into a corner,\" says microsoft's on-leave cto nathan myhrvold. \"he either seems 'me too!' or, if he tries to take credit for being interested in the past, you get 'i invented the internet.'\"al gore, digital drip. it wasn't supposed to be this way; gore was supposed to personify the digital future for all americans. yet it is bradley who took the lead in harnessing the internet as an effective tool for campaign fund-raising and grassroots activism. and it is bush who can claim to be the first candidate to post the name of each and every campaign donor on his web site. and bush who came up with the industry-pleasing agenda: pledging to lift visa limits on high tech immigrant workers, support the three-year ban on ecommerce taxation, loosen export restrictions on high-performance computers and encryption software, and further push securities-litigation reform.doerr says he is not bothered by the buzz surrounding the other candidates. he has, after all, made a name for himself by being ahead of the market. he does not worry that there is no al gore fever upon the land. certainly, there was none at the gore fund-raiser i attended in los altos hills, at the home of real estate developer george marcus. this event, organized by members of the technology network - aka technet, a bipartisan coalition devoted to building political bridges between dc and the valley - brought together several hundred guests from the upper reaches of local tech and real estate. just after dusk, with cocktails flowing, gore stood on a tennis court, working his way through his stump speech in the faint tennessee drawl he summons for such occasions: \"i'm not gonna talk about what's on my mind, i'm gonna tell you what's on my heart.\" the story about his grandson born on the fourth of july landed flat with the thirtysomethings in black. he trundled on, through the moving tribute to his mother and father - the latter a longtime senator and a leading vice presidential contender in 1956 - and then on again, to a long-winded story about discovering the evils of racism in tennessee. he wound up with an anecdote about his odd encounter with stephen hawking, a promise to \"radically reform\" the american education system, and praise for the internet entrepreneurs who've powered the new golden age. the audience clapped dutifully, and tipper was dispatched to play bongos with mickey hart and the flying other brothers. there was no stampede in gore's direction, and so he reached out, inquiring earnestly about the newest startups and soliciting advice about his campaign web site. at times he stood alone watching the band. at one point, grateful dead alum bob weir invited him onstage to rock out with tipper.\"they're here to see you,\" gore demurred with a laugh. \"not me.\"if you believed the techno-utopian prophecies after the 1996 campaign (and wired did), john doerr and the valley's rich, powerful democratic activists were going to remake politics for the next millennium. nearly three years ago, when doerr helped organize a high tech cluster of valley leaders into technet, he spoke of \"digital citizens\" whose bright ideas would flourish in a landscape blighted by an obsolete and corrupt political culture. somewhat schismatically, given technet's ostensible bipartisan status, doerr suggested that al gore would be the horse they rode in on; the visionaries of the new economy would unite with gore to reform the education system and eventually whip government into a state of efficient, networked modernity.the prophets decreed that politics as we know it would yield to a postpolitical age in which the principles of the new economy - information based, networked, decentralized - would be applied to social problems that partisan hacks and their partisan dogmas had failed to solve. \"we feel in some ways like we're reviving america,\" webtv founder steve perlman gushed after a 1997 meeting with gore.with his supple grasp of technology, gore would become community leader of the digital nation. al would be to the net what john f. kennedy had been to television in 1960 - the star of a new medium that would in turn supercharge his campaign.from gore's perspective, the current rush for the geeks' political favor must be truly frustrating: he's done his part, learning more about technology than most politicians ever will and coming forth with a roster of serious ideas that contain the ideal mix of vision and pragmatism. by the courtly code of the senate cloakroom, which served as gore's path to power, such an investment would include an unspoken assumption of payback. but for the valley's newest ruling class, there is no such political culture of give-and-take. power comes just as often from creating new domains as from solicitously navigating old ones. gore may well wish that loyalty were less a commodity and more a virtue. and the valley may wish - indeed, doerr may wish - that al gore would muster a little of bill clinton's fire.\"people might call him stiff, they might call him geeky, they might call him abstract. but the fundamentals of this man are solid.\"to watch gore make the industry rounds is not a pretty sight. his problem keeping up with bradley is the least of it. even though clinton won big in 1992 and again in 1996, the valley is traditionally gop turf, especially among ceos. and the republicans are in a frenzy about george w. bush. his candidacy is mobilizing old lions who've been waiting eight years for a winner, as well as a new generation of gop-minded politicos. at a palo alto fund-raising breakfast for bush this summer, organizers had to turn away a horde of check-waving last-minute arrivals. by september, at a luncheon fund-raiser in redwood city, they were smart enough to have ordered up extra tables.although bush's record on high tech issues is not extensive, he's making all the right noises in a region with a broad libertarian streak. gore's supporters predictably dismiss bush's positions as epandering, but \"w\" has assembled an all-star roster of industry supporters, including jim barksdale, john chambers, gordon moore, and charles schwab.\"republicans in these parts have been waiting a long time to back a winner,\" says floyd kvamme, the senior kleiner perkins partner who is helping organize the bush effort in the valley. \"now we finally have one.\" (kleiner perkins has emerged as the presidential candidates' fund-raising portal for 2000. doerr and another k-p partner, brook byers, back gore; kvamme organizes for bush; and another partner, ted schlein, is raising funds for bradley.)according to the nonpartisan center for responsive politics, bradley outraised gore in the valley $405,100 to $226,525 in the first half of 1999, and edged bush, who hauled in $369,918. by the third quarter, bradley had pulled ahead of gore nationwide: $6.7 million to $6.5 million, prompting tennessee al to move his \"underdog\" campaign to nashville. dollars do not necessarily convert to votes or political viability - not at this stage of a presidential campaign - but early cash flow is a useful barometer of activist sentiment, and the indicators for gore are, to put it mildly, not good.what's the problem? when i ask bradley at a san jose mix-and-mingle why he, not gore, should claim the digital mantle, he seems amused to be called on his chutzpah. his speaker's rostrum is decked with a large blue-and-white \"billbradley.com\" placard. bradley sounds like a home shopping network announcer as he intones \"that's bill bradley dot com\" no fewer than three times during his speech.\"there are lots of people who know more about technology than i do,\" bradley tells me. \"but it's not just about the technology. i have a sense of the interaction of technology, venture capital, and education and mentoring that have combined to create the new economy.\" indeed. bradley used a recent sabbatical at stanford to drill deep into the valley's vc community for financial support.john mccain, the arizona senator and gop presidential candidate - who is also chair of the senate commerce committee, where many internet-related matters are legislated - argues that gore's woes are intertwined with the democrats' mixed record on technology issues. gore is losing his early advantage among the geeks, mccain told me during a northern california campaign swing, because he \"gets torn\" by competing allegiances to other constituencies, such as trial lawyers and labor unions. both groups oppose cherished goals of the tech lobby - tort reform and increased visa quotas for high tech immigrants respectively - and both are major contributors to gore's campaign.as for the tech lobby, the clinton administration only belatedly supported congressional initiatives on securities-litigation reform, y2k liability limits, and an increase in the h1b visa cap. gore's aides hem and haw and suggest in unattributable ways that their man was not thrilled with clinton's foot-dragging but that he must stand by his boss's record. and though the administration recently relented and liberalized export policy for encryption software - after years of trying to reconcile the national-security establishment's concerns with the industry's commercial needs - gore may pay the incumbent's price for that delay as well.mccain has put his finger on part of gore's problem. but the core issue is even more basic: there is no new politics - at least not yet. if gore has failed the valley by not generating enough heat, the valley has failed him in not delivering passion for his political agenda. these days, some of the geeks gore presumed would help galvanize his cause appear bored with the game already. others are behaving suspiciously like old-school lobbyists - writing checks not to reshape the future but to build the industry's clout in washington.tech leaders are also, in mainstream political terms, cheapskates. although the lure of tremendous lucre in the valley beckons, there's still truth to the industry's reputation for \"deep pockets and short arms.\" during the 1998 elections, technet members donated about $3 million to congressional candidates. the group estimates that during the 2000 campaign, its members' contributions to presidential and congressional candidates will double to about $7 million. if that sounds impressive, consider that the outback steakhouse restaurant chain has given 50 percent more than technet members hewlett-packard, oracle, intel, and national semiconductor combined.but that doesn't keep the politicians from coming.\"it's not the revenue - it's the upside,\" observes wade randlett, the democratic political consultant who, with doerr, helped establish technet in 1997. \"the politicians say, 'who's my future, who's my past?' being smart people, they say, 'gee, would i rather be lined up with a dying industry - say, organized labor - or a growing one, the technology sector and the online community?'\"the candidates should take notice, randlett adds. \"we are aligning a community that's growing at 6 percent a month. which of our competitors has any kind of upside like that?\"gore turned to kim polese and asked, \"how's java?\" doerr recalls. \"we all just geeked out.\"randlett's calculations are a far cry from the lofty rhetoric surrounding technet at its founding. \"we are creating something that's a new political form,\" doerr told an interviewer at the time. \"it's not a pac. it's not a trade association. what it will be is a network of individuals and enterprises concerned about education and about making the new economy go.\"even then, it must be said, not everyone put such high gloss on the group. the republicans, most notably, made more mundane noises. jim barksdale, whom doerr recruited first as ceo of netscape and then again as technet's first republican spokesperson, says he foresaw a ceo-centric outfit that would simply apply \"all conventional means\" to advance its political and commercial goals.\"i probably expected washington to respond as they normally do,\" barksdale says now. \"if you come at them with a good heart and the right amount of money, you can get things done.\" barksdale, who currently runs his own venture capital fund from his home in aspen, colorado, emphasizes that he has enormous respect for doerr and considers him one of his closest friends. but, he says, \"people who thought we would reform the political process are naive.\"oh, for those bygone days when gore had the power to charm his audience. in january 1997, days before the clinton administration's second inaugural, a small band of internet entrepreneurs were brought before the veep in the old executive office building. under the soaring, ornate ceiling of gore's ceremonial office, doerr, kim polese, paul lippe of synopsys, scott cook of intuit, and adobe's chuck geschke, among others, gathered around a century-old mahogany desk once used by richard nixon. like eager pupils on a field trip, they took turns sliding open the top drawer to see where every president since teddy roosevelt had - in a moment of what used to pass for presidential naughtiness - carved his name in the wood.earlier that morning, they'd been ushered past secret service agents and marine guards into the plush west wing office of the white house chief of staff, where, suddenly and marvelously, clinton had appeared as if by chance. randlett, who choreographed the visit, watched with satisfaction as he breezed through, shaking hands, squeezing elbows, and patting shoulders. when it was over, randlett says, \"people were feeling a little distance between their butts and their chairs.\"the old white house trick was played in full that weekend, and the geeks fell hard. there were confabs with senior white house staffers, with democratic national committee bigwigs and heavyweights on capitol hill. there was special-access lawn seating at the inauguration, a choice table at a cozy dnc victory dinner, and entr\u00e9e to several inaugural balls.normally, of course, such blandishments are reserved for people who have earned them in a grueling campaign: load-bearing friends of the administration. by those standards, john doerr's delegation didn't qualify. some had never even been to washington before. some hadn't always bothered to vote. but al gore, especially, valued them as an investment. as barbra streisand and steven spielberg were to bill, so, the inaugural welcome seemed to suggest, the young internet wizards would be to the future age of al gore.when i asked doerr to recall the exact moment he fell for gore, he pinpointed it instantly: at that morning meeting, when gore turned to kim polese and asked, \"how's java?\" says doerr: \"that did it for me. we all just geeked out.\"the lavish treatment his crew received that weekend also proved the growth potential of an idea that had taken root only a few months before, when doerr set out to \"put the wiring into place\" between the tech community and washington. he had been motivated by proposition 211, a 1996 california ballot initiative backed by san diego trial lawyer and longtime valley nemesis bill lerach. the measure would have made technology startups and their directors vulnerable to class-action shareholder-fraud suits when their volatile shares lost value. doerr considered prop. 211 an act of \"economic terrorism\" and vowed to fight back.to hear the veterans of the battle tell it, no on 211 was the valley's boston tea party, forging high tech tinkerers and merchants into a revolutionary political class. doerr and two of his partners at kleiner perkins, brook byers and floyd kvamme, transformed the firm's offices on sand hill road into the industry's war room, raising millions for a tv ad campaign and gathering major endorsements, including clinton's, to defeat the measure. the campaign forced a showdown within the democratic party: techies versus the notoriously powerful trial lawyers. when it was over, the newcomers had kicked butt, convincing a spectacular 74 percent of california voters to reject the measure. \"no one thought we could do that,\" says doerr, still savoring the moment nearly three years later.with characteristic let's-make-this-thing-scale verve, the no on 211 brigade resolved to take the valley's tort-reform crusade to washington. reform legislation was pending again before congress, and doerr fretted that the valley and the beltway were dangerously disconnected on an issue that could choke the new economy. despite clinton's support in defeating 211, he had in 1995 vetoed a federal tort-reform bill (a favor to the trial lawyers and one of only two vetoes of his presidency to be overturned), and doerr didn't want to see the industry blindsided again.\"god, we had just spent $35 million to keep a bad thing from happening,\" he says. \"after that we said, 'let's get proactive. let's build some bridges.'\"as general contractor, doerr turned to his no on 211 comrade-in-arms, wade randlett. randlett helped doerr and byers with a scheme to channel the leftover capital and political energy from no on 211 into a bipartisan coalition for civic activism - and thus the technology network was born. from its headquarters in palo alto, not washington, technet would educate people inside the beltway on a range of issues: litigation reform, establishing uniform national standards for reading and mathematics, increasing h1b visa caps, making the r&d tax credit permanent, and challenging encryption-export restrictions.the flyby approach of the '80s - take the gulfstream to dc, tell congress it was brain-dead on, say, trade with japan or biotech regulation, head home - was dismissed as crude and, worse, ineffective. the commercialization of the internet changed everything. it broadened the valley's hardware- and software-manufacturing culture into a center of new media and communications - an evolution that put it on a collision course with the regulatory apparatus of washington. gradually, a whole new set of issues was taking shape: telecom, interstate commerce, and first amendment concerns about privacy, libel, and indecency on the net. in short, it was time to replace disdain with diplomacy.al gore was ready and waiting. he had been toiling on his exhaustive reinventing government program; he had already started promoting the notion of a paperless bureaucracy, putting all taxpayer services on the internet and developing a \"precisely tailored set of empowerment tools\" that would determine the appropriate job-training, health care, and education programs available to needy families. lately, he was talking about harnessing the net to reform public education. and, all the while, technology had remained a backwater at the white house.tech leaders are, in mainstream political terms, cheapskates, with \"deep pockets and short arms.\"\"then, suddenly, it was at the forefront of economic issues, national-security issues, and, increasingly, political issues,\" says tim newell, a former official in the white house's office of science and technology, who in 1996 organized ceo endorsements for clinton and gore. \"it's hard to overestimate how much of a change that was. suddenly we realized, 'there's this whole generation that no one's ever talked to.' it was unclaimed territory - political gold.\"the white house made the standard calculation that, if all went well, the connections with doerr and the entrepreneurs would translate to money and endorsements down the road, in time for gore 2000.moreover, the power of that first impression had been mutual. \"he immediately struck me as a very likable guy with a keen mind,\" the vice president says of doerr. \"i like to think about how new technologies have an impact on the way we organize our institutions and our society. he likes to think about such things because he's interested in the commercial implications.\"by mid-1997, doerr's group was meeting nearly once a month with gore. between budget sessions and meetings with the russian prime minister, the names of doerr, halsey minor, marc andreessen, jerry yang, and a rotating roster of other digerati started to appear on gore's calendar. doerr dubbed his crew the gore-techs, and they promptly become media darlings, a whole new cast of technopolitical crossover artists. there were emails and phone calls from gore, invitations to conferences, speeches, photo ops, and state dinners.gore was smitten. \"these were the people he had always hoped would be in the room someday,\" says greg simon, his former chief domestic-policy adviser and now codirector for the dc-based opennet coalition. \"this was a chance to talk to people who were putting the internet to use as he had always envisioned it.\"al gore is looking wary. he is sitting in his private cabin aboard air force two, tanned and casual in a green corduroy shirt and khakis as we fly to washington after a campaign swing to southern california. he is sipping coffee and leaning back on a settee - signals that he's in a metabolic state of relaxation. but his chuckle feels forced; his brow is furrowed. sooner or later, he must know, the conversation will turn to \"i invented the internet.\"that, of course, is not what gore said to wolf blitzer on cnn last march. what he said - in explaining why he, and not bill bradley, should be the democratic nominee - was this: \"when i was in congress, i took the lead in creating the internet. i took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth, environmental protection, improvements in our education system.\"in context, the assertion is not nearly as ludicrous as leno and letterman would have had us believe. as a member of the senate subcommittee on science and technology, gore did spearhead funding of the 1991 high-performance computing and communications act, which allowed scientists and engineers to transform arpanet from a closed university and defense department system into a commercially viable mass medium. (see \"the gorecard.\") \"if you go back and look at the hearings, nobody else was talking about this,\" gore says, becoming animated as he slowly realizes he's not being sandbagged. \"it was only a rarified research network, and i believe that i was the only person in public life who said publicly, over and over again, 'hey, look, this has the potential to be a national information superhighway.'\"gore continues, putting down his coffee and waving his arms for emphasis: \"and i leaped from that to the metaphor of an information superhighway and started trying to proselytize about the benefit to our country that would flow if we speeded up the emergence of that gestalt. and so, when i said, 'i took the lead in congress,' that point was right. and i should have said, 'i took the lead in congress in helping to magnify the benefits that flow from the creation of the internet by this small band of scientists and engineers.'\"call it gore's law: the more earnestly he strives to convey the utility of his technological insight, the greater the rate at which it recedes. you can see why the guy has image problems. he doesn't merely gather facts; he marinates in great gobs of information, the ultimate purpose of which baffles even his closest aides. i had called a half-dozen of gore's former and current senior advisers to ask how he can generate political capital from his digital prowess.only simon had a quick answer: \"this is a man who imagines the future and then goes out and builds it.\" the others got trapped by gore's law themselves, recounting wonderfully involved anecdotes about the time he invited a prominent icelandic mathematician to lecture his top advisers on chaos theory, or the hours he devoted as a junior senator to organizing a colloquium on coral bleaching, or the time he flew to the south pole to learn how scientists take core samples to measure global warming. (in this context, the gore-techs were but the latest in a long line of seminarians he has invited to tutor him.)on a real roll now, gore wants to know if i've read access america, a report he directed on putting government services on the net. i confess i haven't, so he proceeds to summarize his vision of online government. \"imagine,\" he says with great emphasis at the start of each of several mini-lectures on how information technology can be applied to crime control, childhood immunization, and classroom evaluations. he wants to put more government programs on the internet so a \"community-based facilitator\" can \"coordinate a very precise set of empowering tools\" to help the needy. \"that sounds like an unrealistic goal right now, but it's really not,\" he concludes. \"it's an achievable goal.\"as i'm about to leave his cabin, duly impressed if slightly numbed by the deluge of data, gore asks brightly if i've read the transcripts of his 1981 house hearings on sheep cloning. briefly, i consider lying, but my blank look gives me away. it's patently obvious that i have disappointed the vice president of the united states.\"ah, never mind,\" he says, waving me off gently.kleiner perkins' fourth law: \"there is a time when panic is the appropriate response.\" but this, says doerr, is not the time.john doerr would have you think he is the forrest gump of politics - pure of heart, just darned lucky, and slightly perplexed about the adventures that have come his way. it's not totally an act - doerr's commitment to improving public schools has a genuine, unadulterated fervor - but there clearly are more complex motives at work as well.doerr learned how to work the levers in washington during the summer of 1986, when, on sabbatical from kleiner perkins, he served as a fellow on the senate armed services committee. working for colorado democrat tim wirth, doerr made a routine of dining with one resident washington player each evening and spent his days researching the pentagon to learn everything he could about the arpanet. he boned up on \"cool\" technologies like sun workstations and ethernet. making connections was easy: \"if you were a staffer on the armed services committee,\" doerr discovered, \"you could call up anybody, anyplace in the military, and they'd return your call.\"that same calculation figures into his relationship with gore. though doerr is at pains to present his political goals as strictly idealistic, it would be impossible to overlook the commercial and personal interests also at stake. considering his perch as valley kingmaker, you almost - but not quite - believe him when he downplays the allure of an appointment in a gore administration. (his takeaway from the senate fellowship was that \"politics is a terrible job - you are always reactive.\") and how could there not be an obvious enticement in the prospect of having a friend - and a technologically savvy one at that - in the white house?a lot has changed, too, since early 1997. now doerr's young charges have become celebrity ceos, and the allure of wiring the government has been superseded by major, acrimonious policy differences within the industry. doerr and marc andreessen, for example, staked out conflicting positions over broadband access. (doerr is philosophically aligned with at&t and the cable companies trying to limit isp access to their existing networks, while andreessen is in aol's camp, demanding more.)in some ways, doerr's unifying vision, as expressed in the early life of technet, is more critical now than ever before. but the young machers have companies to run, fortunes to manage, new markets to conquer. who's got time to talk education reform with al gore?andreessen embodies the agnosticism of the valley's younger elite. he likes gore. he's given money to him and hosted fund-raisers for him, and he'll probably do so again. he was a sophomore in college when gore voted for the high-performance computing act, but he knows his history. after gore's internet gaffe, andreessen pitched in to help the veep's damage-control operation, telling reporters gore deserved much of the credit for funding the national computational science alliance, administered by the university of illinois' national center for supercomputing applications, where andreessen's spectacular career was launched. he tells his friends the guy is worth voting for because \"he really understands what we do out here, and what this stuff means, better than anyone out there.\"but andreessen is not putting anything on the line for gore. there is nothing in his congenial tone that remotely approximates the stand-on-the-tracks-and-stop-the-train washington way of pledging oneself to a candidate - whether out of belief, obligation, or the chance for personal advancement.andreessen, courteous and articulate, at the age of 28 has the potential to be a kingmaker himself, and he knows it. the candidates will parade before him and his brethren, hoping to be chosen. they've all been educated about the power of the net. they all say the right things. there may be differences on social issues like abortion, gun control, and school vouchers, but when it comes to issues that matter to the industry, it seems, almost any candidate will do.and that's precisely the point. andreessen tells me the current crop all seem to be \"pretty reasonable people who generally understand what's going on and in general have pretty good policies.\"i think that bush would be fine, i think that gore would be good,\" andreessen says. \"i think bradley would probably do a good job, mccain would do a good job.\" only a sudden surge by pat buchanan would cause panic among the digerati, andreessen adds, because of his anti-immigration and protectionist beliefs.so there's nothing special about al gore? despite all his expertise, and all those meetings in washington and in the valley, nothing that sets him apart? and, uh, isn't andreessen supposedly endorsing gore?\"the nice thing about this is, it's not like it has to be gore or this industry is just hosed,\" he responds. \"or that gore is the only one who understands any of this or is going to do an effective job. he's just into it more than the rest of them are - he's into it more than anyone else has ever been at that level.\"doerr's once-eager band of gore loyalists is dwindling. an unscientific survey reveals that all those hours of face time have not worked political magic with some gore-tech alumni, either. at yahoo!, jerry yang's assistant fires off an email: \"it has never been correct to describe jerry as a 'gore supporter.'\" a company spokesperson notes with obvious displeasure that the white house keeps giving out yang's name to reporters. for the record, yang does not intend to publicly pledge himself to any candidate, though he did give $20,000 to the dnc in 1998.bill hambrecht, cofounder of hambrecht & quist who left to start the investment-banking firm w. r. hambrecht & co., has been considered a gore backer, but he has contributed to bradley (\"a longtime princeton connection,\" observes doerr). a secretary curtly announces that hambrecht will support \"whoever the democratic nominee happens to be.\" cnet's halsey minor, after an intense courtship, is now in george w.'s camp. other valley leaders respond that they have no time to get involved in any campaign.gore claims he welcomes the free-for-all in what was once an easy market. but the techies' diffidence angers greg simon. \"i can't tell you how many people i meet at these conferences who tell me, 'gore just doesn't excite me. he just doesn't make my heart go pitter-patter the way clinton did,'\" he says. \"the thing they love about clinton is the seduction. well, clinton is a seducer, both in the good sense and the not-so-good sense. gore is a persuader. clinton goes for the heart. gore goes for the mind.\"gore was their champion,\" says simon. \"and now it's, 'how far can i stray?'\"risk management being a time-honored principle in the markets, can simon blame dynamos for hedging their bets? \"daytrader mentality\" is closer to the truth, he says. \"sell on news. buy on rumor. gore delivered on the expectations, so now the chat room says it's time to dump him and buy bradley.\"the mood is also fractious at technet headquarters these days. the group is still ensconced in the pleasant mediterranean-style office in downtown palo alto it leases from kleiner perkins. but the startup days are over. there are plans to expand to accommodate its growing employee roster and the stampede of politicians who want to come and touch the future before election day.technet's new ceo is roberta katz, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of barksdale's at netscape, where she served as general counsel. katz also holds a phd in cultural anthropology from columbia, where she wrote her dissertation on \"what happens to human values in times of change.\" she views her work at technet as \"applied anthropology,\" trying to help washington and silicon valley understand each other's strange ways.katz is fond of metaphors. she views herself as a \"cultural ambassador\" and technet as washington's \"portal to the high tech community.\" she winces as she acknowledges that politicians increasingly view technet as a cash register. her staff members spend a good part of their days fending off calls from obscure members of congress who want the group to organize a fund-raiser for them with all the right people.fund-raising, katz insists, is not technet's primary purpose. \"this is about education,\" she stresses; technet's primary role is to teach lawmakers about the new technologies they must legislate. so far, the group has hosted more than 200 lawmakers who want to visit the valley, organizing tours of companies, technology demonstrations, and opportunities to meet the digerati, who may or may not be moved to write a check when the politician calls.katz has upheld what she calls technet's \"ecumenical approach,\" serving all presidential hopefuls equally, though it would be absurd to ignore the high profile doerr has taken in supporting gore and that cisco ceo john chambers has assumed in touting bush. katz recently tapped one staffer to make sure bradley's interests were represented.in september, after clashing with katz over his efforts to organize technet's democratic membership into a gore base, wade randlett quit technet. he joined a san francisco net startup, red gorilla, and the move was spun as a routine leap into private-sector lucre. but murmurs were heard among the gore hardcore that katz was trying to turn technet and its now-considerable financial and political clout away from the vice president. the bushies - so rumors had it - were, with katz's help, trying to reclaim the valley for the republicans after the clinton-gore hijacking. katz scoffs at the notion of partisan intrigue, but seems relieved to be rid of randlett and his founder's zeal.kleiner perkins' fourth law states: \"there is a time when panic is the appropriate response.\" but this, says john doerr, is not the time. \"there will be buzz and hype\" about bush and bradley and mccain, even warren beatty and donald trump, and who knows who else, but in the end al gore will stand alone on the pedestal - because america, though it may not know it yet, is out to hire a new ceo.\"maybe,\" doerr avers, \"i identify too much with the role of a board of directors when it chooses a scott mcnealy to run sun microsystems or a steve jobs to turn apple around - or the disastrous results when the wrong choice is made. when i look at al gore through that prism, i see wisdom, i see experience. sign me up for the smarter, more experienced candidate, as opposed to the more charismatic one.\"though doerr is frenetic where gore is almost pathologically measured, it goes without saying that the vc and the vp are alike in many ways - each quirky, earnest, and wondrously smart, each fiercely ambitious, disciplined, and driven by a boundless faith in the power of technology to improve the human condition.both men travel the prophetic edge of their respective worlds - doerr in anticipating market trends, gore in presaging the intersections of technology and public policy. and both seem oddly oblivious to a lesson the valley has proven a thousand times over: it can be dangerous to get too far ahead of the pack. innovators are notoriously vulnerable to the next in line, who capitalize strategically on the lag and then seize the final advantage.and of failing to see the future, no one could accuse john doerr or al gore. at least, not yet.plusthe gorecard"}
