$760,000 in the red -- or \"underwater,\" in tech-world lingo.since february, amazon's stock has zoomed as high as $221, then plummeted again to below $90.\"i've lost three of my employees to amazon,\" said edwards. \"one went up there at just the right time and got in at $80. the others got in at somewhere over $150. so one guy's sitting on several million in value, and these other schmoes are 50 percent underwater.\"amazon declined to comment for this piece. but the company is not unique -- most of the net's high-flyers have seen similar swings in their share prices, and hence have created similar disparities in their employees' paper wealth.\"i know people who got hired on right at the peak -- right when the company announced a [stock] split and the stock ran up,\" said an employee at excite@home who requested anonymity. \"now they're way underwater. obviously, they're not very happy about it.\"stock options, of course, are supposed to create corporate good will. when the market creates huge disparities between employees, they can do just the opposite.\"if you have two senior engineers who are responsible for 90 percent of your product line, and they start pointing fingers at each other saying, 'why did he get $100,000 more than me?' -- it's a problem,\" said randy ramirez, a compensation consultant with compensation resource group.\"in the valley, one of these guys could just walk across the street\" to another job.in the past, a tech company that had big strike price disparities between employees would often settle the problem by re-pricing options. if a bunch of employees got in at $200 and the stock dropped to $90, the company would simply lower the option strike price to $90.in december, however, the financial accounting standards board put the kibosh on rampant re-pricing by proposing that companies that re-price would have to take a proportionate hit on their future earnings. the proposal hasn't been finalized, but if it is, it will be retroactive to december 1998.that's left tech firms casting about for alternatives.\"this is a new problem that needs new solutions,\" said marty katz, head of executive compensation consulting for west coast operations at william m. mercer.many companies are now pricing option grants in blocks throughout the year. an employee hiring on in january with a 10,000-share option grant might be given 2,500 shares each quarter of his first year, for instance.\"it's basically dollar-cost averaging,\" said ramirez.also, companies may issue additional options to employees who have been nailed by bad market timing.but many tech workers will simply have to live with big disparities between themselves and their peers.if the work is interesting, their co-workers are cool, and their salary is pretty good, they're likely not going anywhere, say the compensation and recruiting experts. those workers are just hoping the markets give them a little reward in the long run.\"i was always a little worried that i would be coming in at the crest of the wave,\" said one yahoo employee. \"but there's a general feeling that [the stock] is going to continue to creep up. you kind of just have to believe that it's going to keep going.\""}
