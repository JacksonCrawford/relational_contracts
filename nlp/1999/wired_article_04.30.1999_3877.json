performance as investors take renewed interest in the silicon crowd. the dow takes a beating. by david lazarus.", "author": "david lazarus", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp":

stocks recovering from their earlier lows, and tech shares clinging to positive territory. it was a day of extremes. share prices had surged in the morning after the us commerce department reported that the economy grew at a zesty 4.5 percent annual rate in the first quarter, way better than expected.but sentiment turned sour in the afternoon as market players fretted that valuations were too high, and that the whole house of cards was set to topple. also, all that economic expansion renewed fears of higher inflation (and a consequent hike in interest rates). the dow jones industrial average, which had risen as high as 10961.71, suddenly reversed course and went down, down, down, for a while losing more than 200 points. in the end, the blue-chip index closed 89.34 lower at 10789.04.tech stocks showed surprising backbone for most of the day, and managed to regain higher ground after they too plunged into the minus column. the wired index fell 0.76 to 648.14, while the nasdaq composite index was 14.43 higher at 2542.87. the s&p 500 was down 7.65 at 1335.18.after a string of record finishes, the dow took its body blows from investors cashing out on some of those \"cyclical\" manufacturing heavyweights that people have been saying are now the market's leaders.but douglas cliggott, chief investment strategist at jp morgan securities, sees the market shifting not so much from high technology back to heavy industry, but away from stocks with staggeringly high price-earnings ratios to those representing greater value for the amount of money raked in. \"it's a very healthy thing,\" he insisted.\"a market that's being driven by stocks with very high p/e multiples works for a while, but not for very long,\" cliggott noted. \"when earnings are scarce, like last year, paying a lot for high multiples makes sense. but when earnings aren't scarce, like now, there's no logic in turning to high p/e multiples.\"he still thinks the dow will outperform the nasdaq and s&p 500 in the near term, and advises investors to aim for a more diverse portfolio, with no more than a quarter of their holdings in technology. \"it's a broader market now,\" cliggott observed. \"spread it around.\"nevertheless, traders are still finding tasty morsels at the silicon buffet. despite some of those fatty market valuations, some investors just couldn't resist piling a few more dot coms onto their plates.case in point: marimba (mrba). the internet \"software management\" firm -- we used to call this push technology, but that's passe -- more than tripled to us$60.75 after making its trading debut with 4 million shares initially priced at $20 a pop. marimba's single most valuable asset may just be its mediagenic ceo, kim polese. but the company nevertheless now boasts a market capitalization of more than $1 billion.for its part, internet services provider appliedtheory (athy) rose 28 percent to $20.50 on its first day of trading. the company sold 4.5 million shares originally priced at $16 apiece, but lacked marimba's glamour.content provider infospace (insp) also climbed 21 percent to $143.31 after posting a slimmer than expected quarterly loss of 3 cents a share and a more than 400 percent hike in revenue. the company's shares have risen more than fivefold since going public in december.and america online (aol) remained on the radar screen, gaining $1.63 to $143 amid reports that it's signed a confidentiality agreement with cable company mediaone group to discuss a possible merger. mediaone reportedly inked a similar agreement with microsoft (msft), which slipped 75 cents to $81.31.all this jockeying for position comes amid a bidding war for mediaone between at&t and comcast. not surprisingly, mediaone (umg) advanced $2.25 to $81.63 while sitting in the spotlight. at&t (t) shed $2.63 to $50.50, and comcast (cmcsa) was 75 cents lower at $62.88.in tech, intel (intc) rose 38 cents to $61.19 as it forecast that its online sales will reach $15 billion this year. dell computer (dell) gained 13 cents to $41.19, and international business machines (ibm) was up $4.38 at $209.19.earnings a to z: adaptec (adpt), a maker of computer gear, jumped $2 to $24.06 after breezing past estimates with quarterly profit of 36 cents a share. but zoran (zran), a maker of integrated circuits, tumbled 19 percent to $10.81 after coming up short of expectations with income of a penny a share.business application developer computer associates (ca) inched 31 cents higher to $42.69 as it said it expects to surpass estimates with fourth-quarter profit of 83 cents a share. shrugging off y2k concerns, the company said revenues are up amid unexpectedly robust sales for its computer management applications.so what's so good about having a whiff of internet about your ipo? just ask consol energy (cnx), which deals in coal and not dot com. the company's stock sank 11 percent on its first trading day. consol arrived with 22.6 million shares starting at $16 a throw.consol had a net income of more than $174 million last year. marimba had a net loss of almost $6 million. one's online. one isn't. you do the math.lastly, philip morris (mo) closed unchanged at $35.19 even as the company greased the palms of shareholders by saying it plans to boost dividends and repurchase more of its stock. also, ceo geoffrey bible drew a line in the sand for all those \"who continue to wage their longstanding war against the tobacco industry.\"if washington continues trying to get tough with the country's cigarette makers, he said, \"we are ready to fight with all our vigor.\" oxygen tanks for everyone!"}
