[the data] will be used in a profile, but it's done [with] openness and honesty,\" hill said.amazon's privacy page describes very clearly the mechanism it uses to make recommendations to one user based on the preferences of others:__\"for purchase circles, we group the items we send to particular zip and postal codes, and the items ordered from each domain name,\" the page reads. \"we then aggregate this anonymous data and apply an algorithm that constructs bestseller lists of items that are more popular with each specific group than with the general population. none of the data is associated with any individual's name.\" __amazon also offers users the chance to opt out of sharing their personal preferences.if such policies were universal, the whole issue of guids and privacy would change, for both companies and consumers, hill said.basically, the guid would be no big deal.\"there wouldn't be any outrage about using a guid if practices were done within the realm of fair information practices, where you have notice and disclosure and access. because there is a lot of value in this.\"by contrast, the surreptitious use of guids -- intentional or not -- by companies like microsoft and realnetworks will continue to be frowned upon, hill said.fair information practices are espoused by many privacy watchdogs and would provide the basis for universal good behavior on the net.fair information policies typically lay out principles of openness and user consent. all records and databanks of personal data would be public and accessible by any individual. as amazon does, sites would spell out the purpose and use of the data they gather. they would also allow users to correct or remove erroneous information.zainoulline and others basically endorse the idea.\"providers have to make it more clear to customers who come to their web sites that any form of registration can result in the capture of private information,\" zainoulline said. \"it just has to be on a consensus basis.\"to simson garfinkel, author of the forthcoming book on electronic privacy, database nation, there's only one way to bring companies around. that's the rule of law.\"we need to pass laws to protect privacy in the 21st century -- in the same way we needed to pass laws to protect the environment in this century,\" garfinkel said. \"nobody believes we could protect the environment without laws. i believe the same thing will be true of privacy in the next century.\"hill said it's time for companies to wake up to the fact that privacy concerns will not go away and that they could stand in the way of ubiquitous e-commerce.\"companies are just out of touch with how key privacy is to their user base,\" he said. \"a relationship [with customers] isn't built by putting a camera over someone's shoulder.\""}
