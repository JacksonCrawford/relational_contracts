you see a lot of web designers with tv envy or print envy, but those are all very passive mediums,\" nielsen said. \"when you're on the web, your hand is on the mouse - it's interactive. when you're on tv, your hand is on a beer.\"web sites should be designed with the user in mind, nielsen said. designers therefore should not deviate from established conventions, such as underlined links, that make it easier for novice users to navigate.\"we have to completely simplify things,\" he said.nielsen's partner, donald norman,is equally passionate about the need for simple computers. norman, a cognitive scientist who has worked for apple and hewlett-packard, is considered among the leading critics of interface design.\"jakob nielsen argues that the web sucks, and i argue that our computing products equally suck, because they're made by technologists,\" said norman, author of the classic the design of everyday things. \"i think our technology is completely inappropriate for mainstream audiences.\"history shows that technologies become prolific in a predictable pattern, norman said. at first, a product's promise of functionality lures technologists and enthusiasts into paying higher prices and ignoring complexity.but late adopters -- up to 70 percent of the population -- don't have the same level of tolerance for buggy products with a high learning curve, norman said. these users only sign on when the product is tested, proven, and simple to use.\"that's a huge marketplace -- they want the benefits of the internet and the interaction, but they don't want the complexity,\" norman said. \"what we like to do is think about the everyday person. the sort of person who does not read wired.\"the computer industry needs to start moving toward what norman calls a human-centered design process where \"the designing is done not by technologists but by people who understand people.\"in his book, \"the invisible computer,\" norman argues that the drive toward an ever-increasing number of features has pushed computers to a level of complexity that's beyond the grasp of everyday people.and product reviewers don't help either. by comparing computers on the basis of features, norman said, reviewers ignore the issues relevant to the late adopters: usability and simplicity.norman predicts a future where the pc is decentralized and broken into smaller \"information appliances\" that are simpler to use and more specialized to the task. the diamond rio mp3 player is one example, he says, as is the palmpilot, which performs only a few functions but does them well.\"the palmpilot is exactly what i'm talking about. notice how [the original developers] resisted adding new features,\" he said. \"compare that to the microsoft equivalent where they tried to add as many features as possible. taking a machine that's difficult to use and making it small doesn't give any improvement.\"original palm os developer rob haitani agreed.\"we did the opposite that microsoft did because we felt that handheld devices are used in completely different ways than pcs are used,\" he said. \"since the usage pattern is diametrically opposed, you need to do a different design.\"haitani is now director of marketing at handspring, a company recently founded by the palmpilot's creators to build alternative but palm-compatible handheld devices. although a separate company, the design philosophy is the same: the focus is on the \"customer's inner tranquility\" through \"instant gratification of data.\"\"they want a product that works and is simple -- and we're very cognizant of that,\" he said."}
