if the answer's no, calea does not apply. if you are a telecommunications carrier under the law and using packet communications, the fcc has said that compliance doesn't kick in until september 2001.\"even if calea does apply to products ip telephony firms may use, the ietf can simply ignore what us legislators say, as the group did when supporting stronger encryption standards than what the clinton administration preferred.ietf chairman baker said the organization has not received any direct requests from the fbi or other law enforcement officials, and some members of the media gateway control working group brought up the subject in august during a discussion on a mailing list. \"megaco's\" goal is to figure out how to replace a telephone company's traditional phone switch with digital controllers.some of the megaco members work for telephone companies that have long since bowed to law enforcement demands, and they seemed ready to compromise. one poster from nortel networks wrote on 24 august that he hoped \"our architecture allows government agencies to do what they require.\"but the ietf area director, harvard university's scott bradner, said he thought the issue was too important to be decided by the handful of members in a working group. he brought it up during a september conference call of the internet engineering steering group, which acts as the ietf's executive committee.the iesg then decided the full membership should try to reach a rough consensus at the november meeting. bradner and another iesg member created a mailing list for the topic and drafted an announcement released monday.privacy advocates say they're concerned. \"if the mindset of the technical people involved in ietf has gotten to the point that they're voluntarily developing surveillance capabilities, that's a very disappointing development. the internet community has been fighting to protect privacy from government intrusion for years and the ietf now appears to be doing the government's work,\" says david sobel, general counsel for the electronic privacy information center.\"why doesn't the ietf start working on a key escrow encryption protocol? where does it end if they're going to start anticipating what government mandates might be?\"jeff schiller, an iesg member and mit network manager, predicted libertarian sentiments would prevail at the november meeting.\"we should not be building surveillance technology into standards. law enforcement was not supposed to be easy. where it is easy, it's called a police state,\" schiller said.schiller pointed to previous ietf decisions -- immortalized in a policy document, numbered 1984, which affirmed the group's opposition to weakening security to aid in government surveillance. more recently, the ietf agreed to include encryption in ipv6 even though us government regulations restrict its export.but some longtime ietf members criticize other decisions.william simpson points out that one proposed standard supports weak encryption, which allows for easy wiretapping.\"the ietf is being pushed around by the large vendors and the us government a great deal. and there's not much we can do about it... there's a lot of politics and a lot of money involved,\" said simpson, an independent security consultant.harvard's bradner acknowledges that the group's membership has changed since the early days.\"it's one thing when ietf was a group going off and doing this sort of research-y network stuff and the network was something us geeks played with. it wasn't an infrastructure,\" bradner said. \"it's only in the very recent past that there's all this talk of convergence and talk of moving all the telephony infrastructure of the world onto the internet.\"peter neumann, principal scientist at sri international and moderator of the risks digest, said the debate over wiretapping is similar to the one over encryption backdoors: both imperil security.\"it's the same argument. you're trying to put in a mechanism that's essentially misusable, corruptible, and compromisable. and you can't do it securely given the infrastructures we have. it's basically impossible,\" neumann said.\"the problem is any system or protocol that has a fundamental trap door in it is going to be misused ... building in things that are fundamentally flawed does not make sense.\""}
