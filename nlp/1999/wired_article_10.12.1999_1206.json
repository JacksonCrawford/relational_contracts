that is the disconcerting tone of email sent to america online users in what looks to be a rash of password thefts targeting the massive online service.the theft is being conducted by way of malicious email sent from the free web service operamail. victimized aol users who contacted operamail staff say the offending messages contained attached programs that sent passwords back to the sender.\"i have caught the programs sending out my password to two different accounts both with your server as their provider,\" reported one aol victim to operamail, in an email.operamail, run by opera software, has responded to the long queue of complaints from aol users by repeatedly closing down offending accounts. since the attacker re-opens new accounts almost immediately, the service said it cannot keep up, however.\"i'm closing down these accounts everyday. i can't stop them,\" said opera sales manager christian dysthe.email that may be using a trojan horse-like virus -- the effects of which aren't immediately detected -- arrives at the inbox of an unsuspecting aol user. one user reported that the attached program bore the name \"buddylist.exe.\"if the user opens the attached file -- which aol claims it repeatedly warns users not to do -- it launches a small program that obtains the user's password and sends it back to the hacker's operamail address.the password-stealing process is identical to the one that stole user accounts maintained by the aol-owned instant messaging service, icq.aol spokesman rich d'amato said the company is investigating the matter. he said the company repeatedly educates aol users to beware the techniques of the wily password-stealer. the company does so by way of a \"neighborhood watch\" information area for users.aol will work with the opera staff to address the situation, he said.the password thefts have the typical markings of bravado hacker activity, where the security breach is conducted for show rather than extensive destruction. the crackers announce the password theft to the aol user then leave the account open so that the original owner can change their password.by examining the messages sent from operamail accounts, dysthe counted at least 10,000 aol password thefts, each containing the alleged stolen passwords as evidence.aol security chief tatiana gau confirmed the existence of a trojan horse that sent an unspecified number of passwords to an operamail.com email address. the company cannot yet provide the number of affected users, but any numbers operamail gives may need tempering, gau said.she said that trojan horses often generate an email each time the victimized user logs on, so the number of affected accounts is likely overstated. \"my estimation is that at least, at minimum, 45 percent duplication,\" gau said.dysthe said that when he notified aol's customer support staff of the problem they were unresponsive, saying it was a result of the general lack of security of the internet and email. dysthe said aol representatives asked him for the ip addresses associated with the abusing operamail accounts but gave no details about how the information would be used.dysthe said emails sent to an aol account used for reporting email fraud were met only with auto-response messages. \"aol doesn't really seem too eager to do much. why aren't they shutting the hole that makes it possible for this virus to [steal passwords]?\"no surprise, said david cassell, editor of the aol watch newsletter. this is just the latest in a string of vulnerabilities aol is failing to adequately address.\"it's part of a larger pattern,\" cassell said by email. \"in 1996, the washington post reported aol cancelled 370,000 accounts in one three-month period for 'credit card fraud, hacking, etc.'\" and by 1998, hackers had hit at least 34 aol areas -- including steve case's monthly column for aol users.no permanent fix can be applied to stop future attacks, aol's gau said, because trojans are very much like viruses, in that they can continually mutate. antivirus software, such as that available on aol (keyword: virus info) must be updated to catch each new trojan horse.\"it's a continual monitoring, keeping your ear to the ground. there's always going to be that gap until the software is updated.\"cassell said rather than tune up its rapid response, aol has quietly adopted a \"hackers happen\" attitude. aol has indicated that it takes measures to head off security breaches, but they are never adequate.in october, the anti-spam community worried that a once-responsive abuse team had been whittled down. they feared that incidents of abuse affecting both aol users and the rest of the internet would be on the rise as a result."}
