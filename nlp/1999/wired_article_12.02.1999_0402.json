toughest ocean races will be carrying enough communications gear to outfit a small navy. everyone's anxious to avoid the tragic loss of life that occurred last year, when a fast-moving storm swept across the perilous bass strait separating australia's mainland and tasmania. the storm took racers by surprise, forcing last minute, ad hoc risky aerial rescues amid roiling 40-foot-high seas and 90-mile-per-hour sea winds.six sailors lost their lives in the mayhem, and the event has gone down as one of the biggest disasters in ocean yacht racing history.the winner of last year's race, sayonara, was skippered by oracle ceo larry ellison. he was visibly shaken by the ordeal, and said that staying alive became more important than victory.ellison is sitting out this year's race, although oracle spokeswoman jennifer glass said her boss has not said why.but organizers took great pains this time around to ensure the competitors' safety. in addition to requiring each boat to carry additional emergency equipment, boats will be monitored much more closely by race organizers -- just in case.the biggest innovation this year will be the inclusion of a satellite transmitter aboard every boat, updating its position in real time to race organizers. positions will be charted on the race's official web site for fans, but also passed along to rescue authorities.the satcom-c transmitters can also receive faxed weather reports. last year and in years past, race organizers had only twice-daily radio contact with the boats, in which they verbally reported their position and received weather information, according to race spokesman peter campbell.such infrequent contact made it harder to warn all competitors about ferocious, fast-moving weather from the west that caught weather forecasters off guard.what's more, the infrequent radio contact made it harder for rescuers to know every boat's precise location when the bad weather struck roughly 12 hours into the five-day, 630-nautical-mile race.further complicating matters, rescuers had trouble distinguishing between satellite emergency-signal beacons known as epirbs when so many boats activated them simultaneously. not knowing which beacon corresponded to which boat made it harder for rescuers to know where to go first.this year, the epirb emergency satellite transmitters will specify which boat activated which beacon. in addition, sailors aboard each racing yacht will be encouraged to carry personal epirbs. this could help rescuers find anyone washed overboard more quickly, campbell said.what's more, each boat will be required to carry a special hand-held, waterproof vhf transmitter in case sailors have to abandon ship. in addition, a specially equipped rescue helicopter has been enlisted to accompany the racing fleet throughout the event. finally, boats will be required to maintain 24-hour monitoring of a special vhf radio channel used to address all competitors.to george snow, owner and skipper of bridabella, australia's fastest maxi yacht, the actions being taken this year by the cruising yacht club of australia are justifiable.\"i don't think they've gone overboard,\" snow said. \"we may not get these kinds of race conditions for another 10 or 20 years, if ever.\"\"ocean racing is a sport that always has had hazards and potential danger, and they are never going to be eliminated, just as they won't be for other outdoor activities like rock climbing,\" snow said. \"i think race organizers have focused on having better contact with the yachts and knowing where they are all times.\"the 76-foot brindabella finished second in last year's race.the sydney-hobart race is known as one of the world's most challenging yacht events, given the often tempestuous weather in the bass strait.located at roughly 40 degrees south latitude, the strait leaves sailors unprotected against the howling winds of the \"roaring 40s.\" the race traditionally starts on 26 december in sydney harbor, with the fastest finishers reaching hobart sometime around new year's day.this year, the field of competitors has shrunk to 84 after only 44 of 115 entered boats finished last year's race. seven sank or were abandoned by their crews, while others sought safety along the southern new south wales coast, effectively pulling out of the race.eager to put a positive spin on this year's low turnout, race organizers say many yachties would rather celebrate this new year's eve on the placid waters of sydney harbor rather than begin the 2000s in tasmania's harsh, cold seas."}
