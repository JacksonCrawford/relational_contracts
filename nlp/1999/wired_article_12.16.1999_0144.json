[the commission] should at least have verified if the elements raised by the plaintiff ... in this case imply the existence of a violation [of abuse of dominant position],\" the court said in a statement.the commission has two months to appeal the decision in the european court of justice, the eu's highest court, or reopen the investigation.a commission spokesman said it was too early to say whether it would appeal, but noted that the eu executive usually respected the court's rulings.the eu commission has tried to stay away from the microsoft dominance issue throughout the trial, saying it trusted the justice department's antitrust division.there is no strict timetable for antitrust investigations by the eu commission if it decides to revisit the micro leader complaint.copyright"}
