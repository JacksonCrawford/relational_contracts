(when the machines tell us so.) whither nature? (\"the laws of physics are not repealed by intelligence, but they effectively evaporate in its presence.\") at times these salvos can venture far afield, as in his belief that we will achieve a state of virtual immortality. but, for the most part, he is content to stay grounded and simply play the role of agent provocateur: \"for now, it's enough just to ask the right questions.\"the age of spiritual machines, by ray kurzweil: $24.95. viking: www.penguinputnam.com/kurzweil.street crednow you're cookinggrand unified remote theorypocket pixhidden agendaliving up to the legendmachine manthe world at your fingertipsthe wrath of goddessmusicjust outta betareadmemaxpowr, minpricehack dreamsrules, schmules - it's thought-provokingservice by andrettefrom gear to eternitycontributors"}
