the collective reasoning of the past, present, and future (as far as we know it). such agents could screen and filter information and anonymously let the digital marketplace know that we are looking for something.two kinds of agents will exist in that scenario: one will stay at home (on your wrist, in your pocket, in your radio) and one will live on the net, surfing on your behalf, carrying messages back and forth. to some degree, the homebodies can be hermetically sealed. they will read bit streams about products and services broadcast in abundance through wired and wireless channels. they will scoop off subsets of information of personal interest - an act as simple as grabbing a stock quote for you, and as complicated as determining your interest in a segment of a talk show. these agents will be \"all ears.\"messenger agents will be more complicated. they will function as we do today when they cruise the net looking for interesting things and people. we are at a time in history when thenet is sufficiently small for some to believe that mosaic and other browsing tools are the only future. they are not. even today, the people surfing the net are distinguished by having the time to do so. in the future, there will be almost as few humans browsing the net as there are people using libraries today. agents will be doing that for most of us.these net-dwelling agents are the ones we need to worry about when it comes to privacy. they need to be tamper-proof, and we must find ways to preclude new forms of kidnapping (agent-napping). sounds silly? just wait until the courts begin to agonize over whether intelligent agents can testify against us.clipper shipssecurity and privacy are deeply interwoven. the government is asking us to sail in an ocean of data, but it wants the ability to board our (clippered) ships at any time. this has outraged the digerati and has become the object of enormous debate in wired and other places. i yawn. this is why.encryption is not limited to a single layer. if i want to send you a secret message, i promise you that i can, without any risk of anyone else being able to decode it. i simply place an additional layer of encryption on top of the data, using an unbreakable code. such codes need not be the wizardry of mathematicians or the result of massive electronics, but can be simple but secure.to prove this, i have put 105 rows of 12 bits on the spine of my book, being digital. these bits contain a message. i bet that you will never be able to decode it. if classrooms of hotshot math students want to try, be my guest. wired magazine will honor you at great length. but don't spend too much time. it is not nearly as easy as the title of this story: james bond.next issue: the balance of trade of ideas"}
