or travel to ftp.ibp.fr in france and peek into pub5/mac/info-mac/comm/tcp. keep in mind - these aren't freeware programs, so read your support materials carefully.elliott stoneglub glub glub...file this one under stupid net tricks. it's the amaaazing fish cam! every 60 seconds, a camera, connected to an sgi workstation and trained on a tropical fish tank, beams a watery photo to home.mcom.com/fishcam/. gardened by lynx author lou montulli, the fish cam sports links to other fishy sites as well. strap on an oxygen tank and check it out!a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away....calling all die-hard star wars fans! those obsessed with the greatest sci-fi trilogy of all time, or perhaps seeking a trek break, can now find mecca on the web. the star wars home page at the university of pennsylvania is a beautiful web site, designed not to give a mere taste, but a veritable all-you-can-eat sm\u00e9rg\u00e9sbord of star wars info. the site spans the gamut of star wars fare, from the nerdy to the unbelievable. you can find the complete scripts of all three movies, as well as trivia, essays, humor files, reviews from the years the films were originally released, and more. there's even a hot link (if you can believe it) to the boba fett home page. the behind-the-scenes info is so dense, you'll wonder if the people compiling it had a liiiiittle too much time on their hands. gorge yourself at <sub>jruspini/info/info.html#scripts](http://stwing.resnet.upenn.edu:8001/</sub>[stwing.resnet.upenn.edu:8001/<sub>jruspini/info/info.html#scripts](http://stwing.resnet.upenn.edu:8001/</sub>jruspini/info/info.html#scripts).werd-nerd heavenwith all the e-mail, newsgroup posts, and irc chat going on these days, it seems the magic of words is at last being rediscovered by the net population. feeding this enthusiasm for clarity in communication is a word a day. surf to lrdc5.lrdc.pitt.edu/awad/home.html and join thousands of others as they commit to memory a new word definition (in english) each day. you can also subscribe to the word a day mailing list by sending a subscribe e-mail request to wsmith@lrdc5.lrdc.pitt.edu. wax your board with some valuable verbiage. word up!binding myth with technologythe quest is a work of experimental web multimedia fiction artfully blending the powers of myth and technology. here, as you move poetically through time toward the tower at the edge of eternity, you may feel the subtle movement of unbound consciousness within the primordial void. joseph campbell's theory of \"the cosmogonic cycle\" is juxtaposed against the quest's winding prose, paving the path between the mythological and cyberspatial with perfect integration. experience this experimental media melding with a journey to www.ccs.neu.edu/home/shaman/quest/. it just may expand your consciousness, arresting the psyche in a moment of timelessness closer to the truth beyond space, time, and causality.\"billions and billions\"armchair travelers rejoice! you too can tour the solar system - from the comfort and safety of your very own workstation! welcome to the planets (stardust.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/) - a saganesque romp through nasa's planetary explorations. here you'll find interstellar pics and terrestrial info on all your favorite planets (in our immediate neighborhood, that is). the graphics are slightly smaller than jupiter, but this one's well worth the download time.not just any afterthoughtputrid afterthought, the red-light district of cyberspace, bills itself as \"the end of the double-barreled, shotgunned cesspool of hyperreality.\" heh. yeeeaah! hyperlinked peep shows are grouped by category: putrid digichrist, latex world, generation hex, and pornopolis now, to name just a few. all of 'em are crammed with wit. warning label and all-purpose disclaimer: this is not for the feeble or faint of heart. how strong is your heart? find out at www.bazaar.com/art/mendoza.html.giving peace a chance - and a net connectionafter considering the noise-to-signal ratio and the contents of the net, many idealistic surfers wonder whether the dream of participating in a globally interconnected peace movement is just too many smoke rings in a cyber pipe dream. truth is that while the internet may be a paradigm-shifting tool, consequential advances toward peace in real human affairs will have genesis only in the minds and hearts of people willing to be peaceful.if you maintain a wish for peace and could use a healthy dose of inspiration, check out the carter center web site located at www.emory.edu/carter_center/homepage.htm. this nonprofit, nonpartisan, nonsectarian public-policy institute, founded by former president jimmy carter and wife rosalynn carter, brings ideas and resources to those in need with an impressive breadth of collaborative efforts.their dossier leaves no room for apathy: it includes field representatives in ghana, burma, zambia, and nigeria, to name only a few locations; collective efforts from the human rights program, the conflict resolution program, the america project, all kids count, and global 2000; as well as global initiatives to fight disease, hunger, poverty, conflict, and oppression. we would do well to spread their sentiments both on the net and irl. paddle on over and bask in the light of peace. no sunblock required.outta site!if you're a surfer who has a favorite digital artist or visual web site you think deserves a little wired attention and international exposure, send us the artist's name and/or coordinates (url), and we'll try our best to get them into net surf. candidate information should be sent via e-mail to outtasite@wired.com.a glittering city upon the waveswhile it certainly seems far-fetched that atlantis will one day rise from its watery depths, organizers of the atlantis project are intent on convincing anyone who will listen that a modern-day paradise, called oceania, is possible.an expandable, floating sea city in the caribbean, oceania's founders hope it will become a new country for the new millennium. guided by libertarian philosophies, this wonderland can be described as the following: \"a capitalist paradise\"; \"a haven for free thought\"; \"your body, your business\"; and \"no taxes.\" drafts of the constitution of oceania and oceania law are among the interesting tidbits available. in fact, if you make a useful suggestion regarding the oceania drafts, they may decide to name a street after you.scuba on down to the atlantis project via ftp at oceania.org/pub/oceania, or via the web at oceania.org. if you'd like to subscribe to the project's listserv, send e-mail with \"subscribe oceania-l\" in the body of the message to oceandom@oceania.org.but don't look for a usenet group just yet. as of this writing, the oceania backers weren't open to discussing what their newsgroup's name should be. \"soc.culture.oceania\" is their name of choice, but as ian kluft, a member of the usenet group mentors, pointed out, a soc.culture group can't be set up for a culture that doesn't yet exist. after a hearty flame war, eric klein, oceania's founder, is back at the table. but it doesn't look like he wants to budge. stay wired for details.fighting aids with informationamong the newer internet sites monitoring aids is the centers for disease control and prevention national aids clearinghouse. this gopher hole offers menu items like reports on aids-related deaths and statistics on hiv and aids cases. it also carries information on prevention, treatment, living with hiv, and where to find more resources. if you have reference questions, general inquiries, or would like to order free publications, the clearinghouse is reachable via e-mail at aidsinfo@cdcnac.aspensys.com. hard-core info addicts will appreciate this gopher server's aids daily summary, a collection of lead paragraphs from various aids-related articles published by the nation's top newspapers, wire services, magazines, and journals. when last we looked, the items were only three days old. valuable also is the full text of the morbidity and mortality weekly report, must reading for health care professionals. a recent issue featured this article: \"trends in sexual risk behavior among high school students - united states, 1990, 1991, and 1993.\" educators also may find an information-gathering visit here tremendously fruitful. for more, point your gopher or web browser to gopher://cdcnac.aspensys.com:72/11 (that's port 72, selector 11 for all you surfers cutting without a web connection).random ascii art o' the month<img alt=\"screen-shot-2018-08-16-at-3.23.30-pm.png\" src=\"https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/1995/06/screen-shot-2018-08-16-at-3.23.30-pm-289x311.png\"/>thanks to the wired 3.06 surf teamjc herz mischief@phantom.comjohn reul johnreul@aol.comjohn makulowich makulow@clark.netrobert franklin robert@wired.comandy rozmiarek andy@wired.com"}
