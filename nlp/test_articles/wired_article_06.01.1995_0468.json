(\"grandma, you look wonderful!\" - \"well, so do you, susie, but how come your lips aren't in synch with what you're saying?\") miniature photo labs have also been in the works, as well as a new generation of digital photocopiers using scanners and laser engines instead of light-lens technology. already finding themselves reevaluating the photo labs, however, kinko's says it will scrap its previous plans and embrace kodak cd digital processing technology.as a kid, paul orfalea was no one's idea of a future empire maker. severely dyslexic, he'd one day refer to his lifelong stupefaction with the printed page as a blessing on par with the supportive parents who never made him feel like a numbskull. but he wasn't so sanguine back at the end of the second grade, when it was discovered that he did not know his abcs, and he had to attend third grade with retarded children. \"back then,\" he grouses, \"they didn't even have a word for 'dyslexia.'\"given his reading difficulty, his mechanical ineptitude, and the fact that his aversion to the printed page got him flung out of a succession of san fernando valley high schools, orfalea realized early on that he wasn't gigantically employable - except by himself. as a teenager, he painted addresses on curbs for date money, but when he finally managed to graduate with a d average, he realized that if he didn't think of something quick, he was apt to be doing his thinking in vietnam. his parents, who joked that they had to spend $50 for every word he read (much of it on tutors), fortunately had money. a year later, he was at the university of southern california, with enough football players in his classes to keep the grading curve low. he majored in finance and supplemented his income with a roadside vegetable stand near his parents' home.as the '60s wound down, and the '70s began, he moved to santa barbara. \"colleges were just heaven to live near,\" he explains, \"so i had to figure out a way to stay around one.\" with $5,000 borrowed in 1970 from the isla vista branch of bank of america (newly rebuilt after its torching by the apple-cheeked revolutionaries of the nearby university of california), he rented a little 100-square-foot garage on pardall road, isla vista's main artery. \"i put notebooks and pens on the sidewalk, and everybody driving to school stopped to buy one,\" he said. on a hunch he leased a photocopier, a film-processing machine, and a printing press for the students to use. he called it kinko's. why not?soon his little place of business - at the back of a taco stand or a hamburger joint, depending on whether he or an early employee is doing the reminiscing - was so crowded with customers that he regularly had to wheel the photocopier onto the sidewalk to make room. he spent his days working with fellow hippies he'd hired to run the leased machinery, and his nights schlepping a backpack full of spiral notebooks and ballpoint pens through the women's dorms. \"i had nothing else to do,\" he chuckles, \"and i wanted to meet girls anyway.\"orfalea exhorted his partners to go forth and multiply, to set up kinko's stores in new areas. the partners did indeed. his cousin dennis itule set up shop in van nuys, california, the site of one of orfalea's many former high schools. brad krause, a hirsute surfer orfalea had hired out of santa barbara city college to run his ab dick printing press, took kinko's up the pacific coast.early on, when orfalea and his lieutenants were still driving vw microbuses, the college student was their archetypal customer. when, in the mid-'80s, the company realized it might as well stay open to the public around the clock (staffers were there till dawn on rush jobs anyway), a lonely undergrad could hang out at kinko's any time of day or night. things couldn't have been more laid-back. if pink paint was on sale near a particular campus, the nearest kinko's would surely be pink. not until 120 stores spanned the continent did anyone think to give the company an official color scheme.those days are long gone. the nation's mom-and-pop copy shops now think of kinko's as the wal-mart of the copy world, a gluttonous bully with an advertising budget that squashes its competitors. in picturesque sausalito, california, recently, the owners of eight printing, secretarial, and copy services griped to the city council after hearing of a kinko's plan to set up nearby. after kinko's, they wailed, would come the deluge: once they were forced out by kinko's, their places would surely be snapped up by burger king and taco bell and wendy's and others unlikely to make the tourists' ferry ride from san francisco worthwhile. \"now, we're the establishment!\" laments paul orfalea.perhaps. but since kinko's 24-hour-a-day routine can accommodate even the most eccentric biorhythms, kinko's attracts disproportionate numbers of artists, musicians, and other creative souls. according to david depman, a goateed sometime-painter, assistant manager, and videoconferencing coordinator of a kinko's near san francisco's golden gate bridge, about 50 percent of kinko's employees \"consider themselves artists first and kinko's employees second, just like waiters who are really dancers or actors.\"kinko's has taken its knocks. the most public of these happened when a coalition of publishers, including william morrow, sued the company for photocopying excerpts from copyrighted books as a service to professors and binding them into anthologies - without permission. many of the books were out of print, kinko's argued, and \"fair use\" (in this case, for education) precludes prosecution under copyright laws. the publishers countered that copying for educational purposes alone doesn't justify the lack of permission to reprint. kinko's was ordered to pay the plaintiffs $1.9 million in damages and legal fees.nowadays, the company is acutely mindful of positive pr, particularly at a local level. over the last two years, the 35 stores of kinko's of ohio inc. have bought the states of ohio, pennsylvania, new york, and new jersey more than 70,000 tree seedlings as recompense for paper the company has used.so why, i asked, does kinko's mark up the price of its double-density diskettes 20 percent over average retail? certainly, this flies in the face of what many corporate officials told me is one of kinko's most cherished goals: democratizing technology. within 24 hours, orfalea himself phoned to assure me that he'd look into the matter personally.while on the line, kinko's media-shy kingpin revealed he had far more important matters on his mind. \"i'm a lousy reader,\" he reminded me. \"why should it be just bullshit words - words, words, words, words - on a piece of paper? why aren't we introducing photos and text, using color more efficiently? in japan, we have a copy shop that's kanji-based. kanji goes pictogram, brain. it takes three pages of our bullshit words to equal what they can do on one!\"ire ventilated, he allowed as how his empire is something more exalted than mere copying. \"when john sculley was being seduced by steven jobs, jobs said to him, 'what do you want to be remembered for, selling sugar water to children?' we're involved in the most creative part of human beings - the intellectual part. where else can you communicate an idea as effectively as at kinko's?\""}
