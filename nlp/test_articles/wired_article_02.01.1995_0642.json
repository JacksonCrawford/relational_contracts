i guess i have too many of those o (for optimistic) genes. but i do believe that being digital is positive. it can flatten organizations, globalize society, decentralize control, and help harmonize people in ways beyond not knowing whether you are a dog. in fact, there is a parallel, which i failed to describe in the book, between open and closed systems and open and closed societies. in the same way that proprietary systems were the downfall of once great companies like data general, wang, and prime, overly hierarchical and status-conscious societies will erode. the nation-state may go away. and the world benefits when people are able to compete with imagination rather than rank.furthermore, the digital haves and have-nots will be less concerned with race or wealth and more concerned (if anything) with age. developing nations will leapfrog the telecommunications infrastructures of the first world and become more wired (and wireless). we once moaned about the demographics of the world. but all of a sudden we must ask ourselves: considering two countries with roughly the same population, germany and mexico, is it really so good that less than half of all germans are under 40 and so bad that more than half of all mexicans are under 20? which of those nations will benefit first from \"being digital\"?and you don't even have to read itone of the many things i learned is that publishers will release simultaneously an audio version of the book. i discovered this at the same time i learned i was expected to read it. being dyslexic, even with my own words, i refused. then i asked knopf if penn jillette (see wired's september cover) could do it. penn is one of the coolest people i know, and i felt he would bring all sorts of magic to the process. during the time when i thought knopf was stewing on this wild idea, they were in fact asking penn, before i could even get to him. he graciously agreed. all he asked me by e-mail was, \"are there any hard words?\" no, there are none.next issue: 000 000 111"}
