dumb rules give dumb systems. the bigger problem is rule explosion. you want to add more variables to capture more causes and to make the system more realistic. you might add humidity and light intensity to temperature in the air conditioner. the catch is that the number of rules grows exponentially as you add new variables. so you try to find optimal rules. the math tells us they cover the turning points of the system - they patch the bumps.where do neural networks come in?at the front end. they tune the fuzzy rules by tuning the fuzzy concepts or sets. i may draw cool air as a triangle centered at 65 degrees fahrenheit. the air is 100 percent cool at 65 but only 80 percent cool at 63 or 67. you may draw a fatter or a thinner triangle. or you may center it at 70. this reminds us that we don't all mean the same thing for even the most basic sensory terms. and that's ok. you get user friendliness by finding your own niche in the conceptual anarchy.you once consulted on the tomahawk cruise missile. what joys will fuzziness deliver in the way of ballistic buggery?the smart war - all of our smart weapons against all of theirs. right now, you have to store 50,000 to 100,000 images of a tank in a cruise missile's chip brain for a neural net to match against. then it can tell a tank from a tree at all angles and resolutions. as chips continue to shrink, you can store more and more of these fuzzy patterns and allow the missile to reason with more and more fuzzy rules.you are a well-published libertarian. is there a political tie to fuzz?for me there are two. first, i am pro-choice on all issues. tyranny is one choice. binary is next with two choices. fuzz gives a whole spectrum of choices - and thus freedom of response. the pro-life zealot who wants to draw a hard line between life and death at conception or the first trimester is a binary tyrant of sorts. there is no hard line between life and death. it's a curve, or fuzzy set. second, i think someday we will see what i call a fuzzy tax form. as it works today, all your tax dollars go to general revenues. but suppose only half did, and the other half goes to social categories of your choice. maybe 30 percent for aids research, 40 percent for debt relief, and 30 percent for environmental cleanup. that way you could set up real research bounties. our binary tax forms deny us such a choice.taxes and death. you oppose them both.yes. it's a hell of a thing to live in a machine that has no backup. i am one of 500 or so who has a cryonic bracelet and hopes to see if future nanotech can rebuild those cells and synapses. that, too, is a form of backup. the better thing is just to upload in a chip. the brain stores about a billion billion bits of information and runs at about 10 million billion bits per second. today you would need a chip the size of a house. but if moore's law keeps doubling the circuit density of chips every two years or so, by around 2020, your brain should fit to the last bit on a chip the size of a sugar cube. you could last until your last chip fell into a black hole or star. on chip time, that may be as close to eternity as we can come in a universe made of matter and energy. heaven or hell in a chip. until then, it's burn, bury, or freeze. i wouldn't bet my life on cryonics, but i am happy to bet my death on it."}
