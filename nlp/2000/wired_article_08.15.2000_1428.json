experts are singing the benefits of technology for preschoolers. but critics say it could harm their development. by katie dean.", "author": "katie dean", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "08.15.2000 03:00 AM", "text": "preschool conjures up images of naptime, playing in the sandbox, and learning how to count. these days, little fingers typing on the keyboard and clicking a mouse are also part of the early education experience. at a young age, \"children very naturally start to be exposed to computers; that's the trend of a contemporary society,\" said ni chang, a professor of early childhood education at the university of wisconsin-whitewater.at issue is whether the trend toward younger is necessarily better.some educators believe that tools such as quality software and the internet can help young children build basic skills and confidence, along with teaching computer skills. others caution that technology can turn preschoolers into unfocused and antisocial little kids, and may hurt their mental development or cause physical injury.\"children need computer skills,\" said chang, a proponent of the early introduction of technology to children. \"i personally think that software, if selected properly, will help preschoolers learn. the child should acquire knowledge at the same time (he) is having fun.\"technology was essential for building the math skills of one 4-year-old boy with whom chang worked. the boy confused the numbers six and nine, a common mistake among children that age, but he also mixed up the numbers seven and 10. using a software program, the child eventually learned to understand the different numerals.preschoolers who are learning about letters and words may also benefit from technology. proponents argue that electronic books combine reading, writing, listening, and speaking to help children's literacy skills develop.technology adds an extra element missing from traditional books. for example, if a child doesn't understand a particular word on the screen, she can highlight it and the computer will read it to her.\"(with) paper and pencil, (kids) don't get immediate feedback,\" said dara feldman, an early childhood instructional technology specialist and head of the technology and young children project, a program for researchers to share the best technology practices for children from birth to age 8.feldman said computer time doesn't have to be time alone. computers can also enhance group work and cooperation.\"a lot of research has shown that when children are paired together to work on a computer, they have a richer discussion,\" feldman said. \"the computer can be a great tool to nurture social skills like asking questions, taking turns, and sharing.\"using the internet, preschoolers can learn about other cultures, and interact with children from around the world.government programs such as head start, which helps primarily lower-income children, have also embraced technology.\"computer literacy is as critical to children today as literacy was to their parents and grandparents,\" wrote helen taylor, the associate commissioner of the head start bureau, in the february head start bulletin.critics, however, say that starting children on computers too early can disrupt important mental skills \u2013 including listening, paying attention, and focus. one educator believes that computer usage can alter the way a child's brain develops.\"the computer doesn't exercise the brain and body together in the same way that normal childhood play does,\" said jane healy, an educational psychologist and author of failure to connect: how computers affect our children's minds \u2013 for better or worse. \"for normally developing children, i believe that they are better off without computer activities until they are about 7.\"for children, learning to catch, throw, and climb are more important than manipulating a computer mouse, healy said.it is more important for children to learn to express themselves and play creatively. hands-on play such as making a doll out of a clothespin exercises more ingenuity than choosing the color of a doll's hair onscreen and clicking it, she said.\"kids are meant to be avid learners, not waiting for the next screen to pop up,\" healy said. \"the child needs to imagine out of their own mind, not by using prepackaged icons.\"developing good social skills is also critical at the preschool age, healy said. if the child is \"glued to the screen,\" she is spending less time learning to relate well to others, speaking, and expressing herself.experts are also concerned that excessive computer use can harm vision, posture, and cause repetitive strain injury among children.\"i do not think that there can be any justification for putting a child this young at the computer,\" said deborah quilter, author of the repetitive strain injury recovery book. \"would you hand a child a pack of cigarettes at the age of 5?\"quilter stressed that even with an ergonomic workstation there is risk of injury because rsi is a cumulative problem.\"parents, through their own ignorance, may end up paying for it with a child that has a permanent disability early in life,\" she said.while technology proponents believe that ergonomics are important, chang dismissed quilter's argument.\"i haven't read any research about that,\" chang said, but she acknowledged that setting up the computer on child-size furniture is important, and computer time should be limited to 30 minutes.technology proponents add that the computer should be used as a supplement to other preschool activities, not a replacement for them.\"it's not a zero-sum game,\" said elliot soloway, an education and computer science professor at the university of michigan. \"kids don't play outside or use the computer: they do both.\""}
