what do you think a patent is but a government-backed monopoly that will extend for 20 years?'\" he said. \"if i weren't this pathetic, comfortable, milquetoast coward, i would have screamed.\"if government continues to listen to these businesses and their lobbyists, lessig fears it will continue to build into the network -- in terms of laws and the software code -- restrictions that will crimp innovation.and which businesses are the biggest threats? surprisingly, lessig didn't point to redmond or silicon valley, but to an old antitrust target. lessig has been considered a foe by microsoft, which successfully had him removed from working for the government during the early stages of the antitrust proceedings.\"in a bizarre twist of history, we're watching as the new at&t buys up fast pipe in this country,\" lessig said, and the company is building up controls just like the old at&t \"so that network owners will decide what kind of apps will run.\"lessig next gave a short history lesson on network architectures and politics. when one company controlled the telecommunications network in the united states, he said, innovation was tightly controlled. any new feature on the network had to be approved by that company, the entity with a vested interest in maintaining the current arrangement.he called the u.s. government's 1984 breakup of at&t \"the single most important event in innovation of the internet.\" it gave birth to \"a network that builds destruction into its architecture: destruction of the old, embrace of the new.... innovation works best when new ideas don't need to apologize.\"unfortunately, washington is focused on the battle of the last decade: control of the operating system. \"while we've been fighting a battle against a threat of 1990s, the 1990s have ended and this new threat has emerged.\"the threats he outlined relied on a common factor: well-intentioned but clueless lawmakers and bureaucrats in washington, d.c., who \"like a child riding a bicycle for the first time, they are panicked -- (but) they want to keep doing what they did to make it work.\"no one knows exactly why the internet has succeeded so wildly. and because we don't understand the reasons why it thrives, we're likely to destroy it, lessig said.\"it,\" in this case, is the economic growth powered by e-commerce. but just exactly what they should be doing isn't clear.\"something worked, nobody planned this, but something worked here. we've tripped onto this walden pond of creativity and innovation, and we have no idea about what inspires its magic,\" said lessig, who also mentioned that he is leaving the environs of walden pond to move to stanford university.ma bell's partner in threatening the net as we know it, according to lessig, is mpaa chief jack valenti and hollywood's growing appetite for intellectual property rights.\"i remember in the old days when we laughed at this old giant hollywood. we laughed with great pride at how backward they were. but that was a time of extraordinary stupidity and naivet\u00e9. the idea that this industry would roll over and die, give up without a fight, was silly.\"hollywood caught on early, lessig said, and has been working quietly in the background to produce legislation like the digital millennium copyright act that extends copyright protection further than ever before.\"we should be able to learn the lesson from this and respond by assuring that the next network, broadband, is like the last. but we in america are not able to do this. we are responding to this change with slogans: 'let the market regulate! laissez faire will take care of the outcome.'\"when one audience member criticized him for spending an hour addressing europeans on the situation in america, he took europeans to task for letting america bully them into following suit.\"as long as you allow the u.s. government to buy your governments off, your status as a relevant player in this internet culture is not credible,\" he said. \"you've got to earn your independent status. start doing that, and then i could just stay in the u.s. and have a happy life.\""}
