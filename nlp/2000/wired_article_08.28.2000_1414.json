"timestamp": "08.28.2000 03:00 AM", "text": "san francisco -- the music industry's stumbling over digital rights will be the publishing industry's gain. at least, that's the hope of organizers at seybold seminars' first-ever one-day event dedicated to e-books.\"the commercial publishers have an opportunity to get it right where the music industry didn't and avoid a napster-like situation,\" said mark walter, editor of the seybold report on internet publishing.\"if they can come up with a standard that everyone agrees to and (it) can be implemented in a way that users will buy the content legitimately, rather than pirating it, everybody wins.\"the conference comes as the emerging e-publishing industry is at its hottest, fueled by recent commercial successes from mainstream authors such as stephen king.but even as authors, traditional publishers, and web retailers are churning out new digital content and e-book devices, they are still struggling with how to make the fledgling business work.despite the buzz and the hype, issues such as standards, rights, and inter-operability must be worked out before e-books become a widespread commercial phenomenon.monday's e-book event kicks off this week's seybold seminars san francisco 2000, the west coast's largest publishing conference.\"we're hoping to give a sense of where the e-book market is today and where it is going,\" walter said.kate tentler, vice president and publisher of simon & schuster's online division, and kenneth brooks, vice president of digital content for barnes & noble, will join other publishers, retailers, and vendors to discuss current e-book technology and future market potential.e-book vendors will take over 11,000 square feet on the show floor to showcase their technologies and security solutions.microsoft (msft) will demonstrate its recently announced digital asset server, a digital rights management (drm) solution, and windows-based pc reader.the e-book event follows an opening keynote address by dick brass, vice president of technology development for microsoft. brass will speak about digital rights management, anti-piracy, and encryption, some of the most hotly debated topics among e-publishers and authors.the open ebook forum and the american association of publishers, which both formed task forces to investigate digital rights management last summer, are expected to announce their progress.\"right now, there's a lack of standards on that front,\" walter said. this year's event \"will recognize that there is a lack of standards in digital rights management that's hindering the adoption of e-books.\"currently a variety of providers including microsoft, contentguard, intertrust, softlock, adobe, and glassbook offer their own drm technologies.the variety of digital rights management solutions points to a lack of standards and inter-operability, walter said. although users can buy rights that are compatible within a platform, they can't transfer those rights to another platform.a special session will address the topic of inter-operability, with updates on key e-book standards and initiatives, including the electronic book exchange, open ebook publication structure, adobe pdf, and other standards.\"there will be a battle among vendors on who is setting standards that will get hashed out in the next 12 months,\" walter said. \"it remains to be seen whether there will be a standards body or a de facto marketplace.\"the standards body must succeed in winning the major e-book players before an agreement can be reached, walter said. if standards can't be reached, publishers may hold back and the public may not buy electronic content.\"all the major processes have begun,\" walter said. \"but the stakes are getting higher in the market place.\"\"we've got an industry bringing products to market before there are standards for inter-operability,\" said james alexander, chair of oeb's drm working group subcommittee on business models and ceo of mibrary, a digital library service that manages digital content for users.\"a cross-functional standard is critical for the industry to achieve,\" alexander said. \"if publishers and the oems don't get their act together, there will be no marketplace.\"in addition to educational sessions, the results of a comprehensive survey of past seybold attendees on e-book awareness, adoption, technology, and formats will be announced.\"from our research, there's a very strong interest in e-book devices and publications,\" said lawrence manuel, who helped conduct the seybold study. \"but we don't think that print is going to go away.\"the survey found that 64 percent of respondents were interested in reading on a variety of e-book pc or non-pc devices. but only 20 percent had either read or downloaded an e-book. \"we think that's higher than the general population,\" manuel said.in addition to the e-books event, other tracks will include digital imaging, xml, pdf, e-commerce, on-demand printing, and other sessions on both print and web publishing.steve jobs, ceo of apple (aapl), will deliver the opening keynote on tuesday. john seely brown, chief scientist of xerox parc; john gage, chief researcher of sun microsystems (sunw); paul saffo, director of the institute for the future; and john warnock, ceo and co-founder of adobe systems, (adbe) will debate the future of publishing in the next 20 years."}
