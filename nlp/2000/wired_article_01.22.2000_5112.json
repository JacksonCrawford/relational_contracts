'it's a bulkregister problem,' said brian o'shaughnessy, a spokesman for network solutions.\"while likely true, this seems to reflect the attitude that network solutions has consistently shown over the years as it has made its own series of mistakes. it seems that network solutions, along with icann (who also deflected responsibility), should recognize that there are customers out there with a problem, and that the \"keepers\" of the internet, so to speak, should work together to resolve the problems on behalf of their customers rather than simply pointing blame.arrogance has no part in something as open and vital as the internet, and customer service always wins more friends and business when solving problems regardless of the what, when, who, or why."}
