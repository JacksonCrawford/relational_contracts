internet, where the future of an embryonic online radio industry is still in the making. andy patrizio reports from los angeles.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "08.02.2000 03:00 AM", "text": "los angeles -- the internet has become a second channel for many a radio station, and occasionally the second home of dead ones. now an alternative station here is moving lock, stock, and turntable from the fm band to the internet. by fall, kacd 103.1 expects to become the first fm station to transition straight from the airwaves into an exclusively online broadcast format. the 103.1 frequency will be sold to a spanish-language programmer as part of a proposed merger, but in an innovative move, the new webcaster will be backed by the very company that's selling off the radio arm.when kacd parent company clear channel announced in october that it would merge with amfm in a $56 million deal, officials decided to sell the 103.1 frequency in order to adhere to federal guidelines forbidding companies from owning more than eight radio stations in any one market. migrating to the internet offered an opportunity to hang onto an upscale demographic that might drift elsewhere.kacd's worldclassrock.com has already begun transmitting its mix of adult artists like the indigo girls, eric clapton, b.b. king, and sting, suggesting it may well have a smooth transition off the air when the deal with dallas-based amfm closes. clear channel expects the federal communications commission to approve the merger by september 30.officials at san antonio, texas, company clear channel said they could not comment pending approval of the merger. but kacd program manager nicole sandler said she's looking forward to moving into new territory and is already thinking beyond the wired internet to wireless internet radio, which could someday allow people to listen to net radio stations in their cars.\"if this works, and i think it will, it will open the floodgates to a whole new mode of radio, in terms that transmitters may some day become obsolete,\" she said.if history is any guide, worldclassrock.com's chances look good. for some, simulcasting over the internet or resurrecting a defunct radio station online boosted their reach mightily.the 2,850-watt transmitter for freedom, california's kpig 107.5, is about as strong as a hair drier, making it hard to hear even in the santa cruz area where it's based. but by webcasting its audio beginning in august 1995, it's built a worldwide following and was ranked no. 16 on the arbitron rating of internet radio in february.then there's two los angeles orphans, groove radio and knac pure rock.knac 105.5 was the center of the l.a. headbanger universe before being sold in 1995 to a spanish-language broadcaster, a common fate for niche stations in los angeles. groove radio was a dance-oriented station. both now exist as internet-only plays after being revived online by former knac employees and, in the case of groove radio, by a third-party company.knac.com founder rob jones wouldn't go back to fm even if he had the chance.three years after bringing back the knac brand, the website is no. 12 in the arbitron ratings of internet radio stations. with 600,000 unique feeds per month and over 20,000 people listening at any one time, it has more listeners than it ever had while on the airwaves in los angeles.\"knac.com has successfully transitioned from a local radio station to a worldwide entity,\" jones said. \"the radio station always had a limitation based on signal strength and being local.\"long-time los angeles radio watcher and historian don barrett, who runs la radio.com, thinks kacd has a challenge ahead since it wasn't a huge ratings success on the fm dial.\"knac is offering music not readily available on commercial stations. much of the kacd music can be found on other stations,\" barrett said. \"sold in combination with other clear channel properties ... the format on the internet can stay alive, but on its own as a stand-alone facility, it would face an enormous challenge.\"\"to think that in an era of embryonic technology and no mobility with the internet (yet) that they can survive, is very optimistic,\" barrett said.worldclassrock.com will, however, have the advantage of the $880 million radio giant behind it.when the clear channel-amfm merger is complete, the family will include 830 stations around the united states, many of which will promote the worldclassrock.com site. in addition, kiis-fm, a clear channel holding in los angeles, will continue to sell advertising space for the station.worldclassrock.com's audience isn't the biggest or the most fanatic, but it's the kind advertisers love. they are 25-54, college educated, professional, and have a higher level of income than the demographics for other stations, according to arbitron research. this leads to a very high retention rate, a vital characteristic in both radio and on the net.upcoming plans for the site include a chat room, message board, and other interactive features that have become so popular on internet radio stations. the station currently hosts as many as three weekly live performances by artists like melissa etheridge and tori amos from its studios every week, a practice that will continue.\"people just turn the station on and they leave it on all day,\" sandler said. \"we're not repetitive like commercial radio is, so people are able to listen longer.\"the switch to the internet otherwise won't mean much change for the station, with the exception that programmers will no longer have to consider advertisement-heavy drive times when they assemble their playlists. worldclassrock.com's target audience remains 25- to 54-year-old professionals listening at home and at work, not those on the road.the station's fans, in fact, had a part in its transition online when more than 21,000 people signed a petition on the kacd website asking fans to support the move. going to the internet \"was something (clear channel) had been thinking about,\" sandler said. \"i think they were encouraged by the response we got on the petition drive.\"jason jackson, editor and founder of radiodigest.com, which watches the national radio market, thinks worldclassrock.com can attract an internet audience as dedicated as its audience in los angeles. but both he and barrett question the economic viability of internet radio.\"right now, i don't think anyone has successfully determined how internet-only radio stations will generate enough revenue to make their efforts worthwhile,\" jackson said."}
