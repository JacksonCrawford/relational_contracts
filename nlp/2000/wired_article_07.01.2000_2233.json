the number of people who can be lucky for five years is smaller, but it's still pretty big. the number of people who can be lucky for 30 years, like warren buffett, is really small.how much of a role has luck played in amazon's trajectory?huge. huge. i believe that all startup companies need a huge amount of luck.what were some of your early breaks?they're too numerous to enumerate, but hiring shel kaphan [amazon's first employee and cto] was one. and being stupid was very, very lucky. for example, everybody we talked to said, \"don't launch with a million titles, launch with 300,000.\" we had no idea how hard it would be to sort all those titles, and in our blissful ignorance we went ahead and did it. i can tell you in retrospect all our early advantages came from those extra 700,000 titles. that's what impressed people. if we had started with 300,000 titles, we wouldn't have succeeded.you didn't listen to these strategic geniuses.but we should have - that's the point.what will amazon look like in five years?a place where you can buy anything and everything. and if that's your goal, you better have a tactic to accomplish it, a partnership strategy. for us, it's thousands of partners of all sizes and business models. that's what we're trying to do - within the context of being earth's most customer-centric company.are there any role models for amazon?the model is sony. sony had an early mission to make japan known for quality. not to make sony known for quality - it was bigger than that. this was right after world war ii, when japan was synonymous with low quality. and sony did it - an amazing feat. what we want to do is not just have amazon.com known for customer service and customer experience, but to raise the worldwide bar on these things. i think we can do it, but it's a 20-year kind of goal.sony ceo nobuyuki idei said recently that success for his company depends on the ability to relinquish traditional notions of control. is amazon out of control?i think in some ways it is. for example, we don't control what customers say about our products. one of the best ways to provide value to customers is by utilizing the organic forces that the internet makes possible - if you set up the infrastructure properly, millions of people can collaborate - but some of these notions are very uncomfortable inside a company, in the same way that idei-san is saying out of control. you can also build a better customer experience by partnering with thousands of slightly uncontrollable partners. for instance, the zshops [amazon's specialty retail sites] sometimes get used to compete against us. i am constantly finding toys on our site that a zshop is also selling, sometimes at a lower price. if you are used to having very strong control, that is a terrifying notion. but i really believe you can build a more robust company if you give up a bit of that control in this organic marketplace.what do you do when you see that a zshop has the lower price?we would try to match that price. if we're going to sell something, we should be selling it at a competitive price - or we should just stop selling it.could you get amazoned?of course. i don't claim amazon.com is a lasting company yet. i claim we're in a leadership position and have the resources and the team to build a lasting company.are there going to be other amazons?there may be one or two others, just like there are one or two other wal-marts. there's target and kmart; target is kicking butt, doing great, so there are likely to be a few, not many, pursuing this particular strategy. but there are going to be a lot of strategies, and thousands of big winners. you're going to have at least twice as many big winners online as in the physical world, because new business models are possible.what's the life span of a strategy?there's no rest for the weary, if that's what you mean. even the most durable competitive advantages fade with time if you don't replace them with new advantages. there has never been any company i know of where that hasn't been true. one of the best durable advantages is a good consumer brand. history has shown this to be true. some of the most persistent companies are those with the strongest consumer brands, like coca-cola.yet one could argue that amazon undercuts its brand by elevating the importance of price - that brand loyalty and price sensitivity are not a long-term marriage.we're known for competitive prices, i agree. that's very important online. but we're also known for great customer experience and great customer service. if your brand is based exclusively on price, you're in a fragile position, but if your brand is about great prices and great service and great selection, that is a much better position. there are a lot of different ways to construct a brand. i believe brands that stand for abstract concepts are more durable and more robust than brands that stand for something more concrete. a company's brand is a lot like a person's reputation. i would like our reputation to be that we start with the customer and work backward.what can't you do and keep your reputation?we can't do ordinary things in ordinary ways. we get advised by various people to open physical stores - they tell us, \"it's a great brand name and people will flock to the store.\" i always ask, \"what would be innovative about that experience? what is your idea about how we would revolutionize the physical shopping experience?\" if we can't do that, then i don't want our brand on it.has the ongoing controversy over amazon's \"1-click\" patent hurt your reputation?if you look at our inbound email, the patent issue is not at the top of the list of things generating customer response. the biggest issue is that we advertised on the howard stern show. we got thousands and thousands of letters and emails from consumers who can't believe we would advertise on the howard stern show. people heard the ad, but i don't think it influenced their shopping behavior in the way we were hoping!what's your take on the patent office's approach to software?there really is a problem with software business-method patents, and i don't think it's a small problem. but i'm not going to put amazon.com at a unilateral disadvantage. that's out of the question.still, you've been criticized for using the \"1-click\" patent offensively-patents are not intended for defensive purposes only. the intent of the system is to give innovators a window to recoup their research and development costs - 20 years from the date of filing or 17 years from the date of issue, whichever is longer. a period of 17 or 20 years, in my opinion, is excessive for software; it should be 3 to 5 years. so one of the problems with the patent system - and this is a very hard problem to solve - is that it's one-size-fits-all.maybe software shouldn't be patentable at all.you can make that argument. i personally don't make that argument.so, blame the patent examiners.it's not their fault. it's rule 56's fault. [us patent rule 1.56 requires filing companies to list prior art - if they find it. the rule, many feel, rewards willful ignorance.] rule 56 needs to require companies to search. if companies are required to search, people will build tools to make it possible for them to do so.would you get into that business?if you have some spare time and would like to be the ceo of a company, come on over and we'll talk. actually, i have offered to help fund a prior-art database, on a very hands-off basis. just to get it started. [see bezos' open letter at www.amazon.com/patents.]what are the three smartest things you've done in the past 12 months?that's a very hard question - and not because it's such a long list! it's a hard question because it's such a short list.ok, what's the single most interesting thing that's happened?becoming a father. but if you had asked me a couple months ago, i'd have said getting to know oprah winfrey. she is the most inspiring person i've ever met. she invited me to come speak to the business school class she teaches at kellogg. then i was on the show and talked to her some more. on camera and off, she's exactly the same. now that i really understand her, i can see that she is all about empowerment: live your life, use your life. these are things that she really, really believes. it's the perfect fit of person and job. looking at the number of people she affects in a positive way, she'd have my vote for the person doing the most good in the us right now.does oprah use amazon?yes, she does - i taught her. how could she be on the internet without that skill?what have you learned lately about management?that you need a strong planning process. that as you grow, the management process needs to be less ad hoc and more formal.sounds like a bureaucracy.it sounds like it, but it's not. in a bureaucracy people mindlessly follow rules instead of thinking on their own. but a strong planning process is actually very empowering and allows for decentralization because everybody is moving in the same direction. even from the beginning we've had a very formal hiring process. you need process for anything that's repetitive because you don't want to have to reinvent the wheel every time. there is a very widespread misunderstanding about process: people believe that all process is bad.ok, so process is good. what about communication?well, people think communication is good. but communication is not a fundamental good - it's a necessary evil. the goal in organizing a company should be to reduce the amount of communication needed. every minute spent communicating with your peers inside a company is a minute not spent improving the customer's experience. this is a hard thing to explain, and people get it wrong all the time. the reason communication ends up being incredibly important is that it's impossible to organize perfectly inside a company - so you need a ton of communication to compensate for the imperfections inherent in the organizational structure.so, in the perfect organization there'd be no need to communicate?exactly. i go overboard when i talk about it and then everybody thinks i'm just crazy. you don't strive for more communication. you strive for less and then recognize your limitations and communicate around them. you can tell where organizational structure is broken by looking at where the most communication is happening.how do you prevent the creep of bureaucracy?if you ever get ahold of the magic bullet, call me. i believe the biggest factor is the people. there are people who like to think and people who like to follow rules. you need both; you need diversity in a company. but you really need a critical mass of people who will only tolerate good process. what happens is that 10 or 15 percent of the people will tip the company one way or the other. if you end up with your influencers being nonbureaucratic, the rest of the company will tip that way. so you try to select for that in the interview cycle.how many people do you personally interview these days?i still spend a significant amount of my time on recruiting, but except for the most senior positions i'm involved only after we've already decided we really want this person and understand how we can fit this person into the company. we've been able to raise the bar. i wouldn't get hired at amazon.com today.some people think amazon has had its day - that soon there won't be any need for online retail outlets because personal agents will connect the consumer to the distributor. and it'll be the branded agents that matter.interesting theory. what's the difference between amazon.com and a personal agent? interesting question. personally, i don't see one. our core job is to help people make purchases, and we're investing more in personalization than anybody else. you tell me."}
