software? open-source guru eric raymond\u2019s seminar on \"successful advocacy and media manipulation\" offered to help purveyors of linux convert corporate decision makers. the self-appointed evangelist and author of the cathedral and the bazaar delighted the packed linuxworld audience with his crash course.he began by pretending to stammer into his microphone with the concept that free software enthusiasts most need to embrace: \"m-m-m-m-marketing.\"only two people in the audience had heard raymond speak before, and the crowd was rapt as he revealed his \"conscious, cold-blooded plan for world domination.\"step one: don\u2019t expect enlightenment to trickle up the chain of command at your company. you may have to risk getting in trouble by being bold enough to circumvent middle management.most hackers don\u2019t play golf with fortune 500 ceos, raymond pointed out, so another way to get access to them is with a media-centered campaign. aim for the mainstream press \"to slip your lsd into their conceptual water supply.\" work on saturating places like the economist and the wall street journal.step two: learn the lingo. corporate honchos will think you\u2019re a communist if you use the words \"free software.\" instead, raymond suggested using the \"suit-friendly label: open source.\"raymond also suggested practicing the language of the corporate set by letting phrases like \"return on investment\" and \"strategic business risks\" roll off the tongue. it can help, raymond said, if hackers stop thinking of business people as stupid and make sure they don\u2019t ooze contempt during meetings.\"i can see a lot of you swallowing hard out there,\" raymond said.the most convincing arguments for open-source based systems, raymond said, are touting its reliability and stability. try arguing that opening up source code is the best route to creating rock solid software, he said. point out that this process is how every branch of engineering works. engineers doing really large projects like dams, he said, show their work to others before building.\"give away the recipe, and open a restaurant.... that\u2019s what red hat is doing,\" he said. \"the value is not in the recipe.... a reliable customer experience is what people will come back for.\"as an argument against closed systems, he said advocates could point out that microsoft has had to patch two security holes in windows 2000 before it's even been officially released.scott martin, a middle manager with daimlerchrysler, said raymond had an excellent understanding of the corporate world and could be a \"bridge\" between the two camps.learning how to work with corporate power was the focus of an earlier session as well, when bruce perens gave a talk on how to keep free software developers interested as linux goes commercial. perens is the primary author of the open source definition and president of the linux capital group, a venture-capital firm.perens said developers will continue to harness the benefits of sharing through free software because they want to see their work survive. he said the hackers' \"community ethos\" will keep companies in line.\"we don\u2019t want to be unpaid employee dupes of your company ... because community acceptance will determine whether you will make money in linux,\" he said.when companies step out of line, he said, hackers usually raise enough of a ruckus that the problem is corrected. \"the development community is indifferent to whether vendors are able to make money,\" he said. \"we want users, and that\u2019s why we tolerate and assist companies.\"he said sun microsystems\u2019 staroffice may look like it\u2019s free, but it doesn\u2019t actually provide many needed applications. sun did release an open source reference implementation of some of its software on tuesday. he also praised ibm for understanding the community, and for working with him on open source licensing.he cautioned that while red hat is off to a good start, recent comments by the company\u2019s president indicating that \"if linux standardization helps red hat\u2019s competitors get a leg up they won\u2019t help\" could spell trouble.\"anger is an energy,\" perens said. \"when linux guys resent something they\u2019ll go to work ... and help your competitor.\"perens sits on the boards of four corporations and, like raymond, has been consulting on how to design licenses and copyrights to protect individuals while sharing their work. companies also need give back to the community, perens said. he said linuxone \"did everything wrong\" and as a result their underwriter pulled out, and now they have delayed their ipo. he criticized corel corporation for releasing a beta which asked testers to sign ndas promising they wouldn\u2019t share the code.but perens recognizes that there\u2019s more to life than just software. he offered career advice to 16-year-old kirk fort, a fan who took the train from south carolina with his mother.fort told perens he wasn\u2019t sure what he should major in at college.\"don\u2019t just be a programmer,\" perens said. \"the other thing is to have a life.\""}
