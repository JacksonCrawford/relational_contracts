problem that figures to get worse as wireless phones get more popular: digital cell phones interfere with hearing aids. the fcc is currently accepting suggestions by the industry and people who wear hearing aids as to what should be done to make digital cell phones accessible to the hard of hearing.cell phone transmission of radio waves creates an electromagnetic field around the phone's antenna that causes an unpleasant humming sound or buzz for people with hearing aids, said david baquis, a director for the self help for hard of hearing people.digital cell phones and hearing aids \"interfere to the point (that hard of hearing people) don't want to have a conversation at all,\" baquis said. \"not everyone has the same kind of experience. there are no identical types of hearing loss so they might experience the annoyance in different ways.\"organizations for the hearing impaired, such as shhhp, have asked the fcc to make cell phone manufacturers comply with the \"hearing aid compatibility act of 1988.\"the law requires that fixed-line phones be accessible to the disabled by \"inductive coupling\" -\u2013 or including technology that muffles background noise and amplifies the phone conversation.a spokesman for the cellular telecommunications industry association said the industry has been discussing the problem for a long time. it plans, early next year, to release standards that cell phone manufacturers must comply with to make sure their phones don't interfere with the different types of hearing aids on the market.nokia (nok ) and motorola (mot) already have headsets that people with hearing aids can use with their digital phones.\"wireless digital phones are not the only kinds of equipment to cause interference with hearing aids,\" said ctia spokesman travis larson. \"computer monitors, fluorescent lights, security systems in drug stories that send out signals to catch people stealing a product -- all of these create fields that interfere with hearing aids.\"indeed, we are taking steps in our industry to make life a little bit easier.\"microsoft: palm talent needed: microsoft (msft ) attended the palm (palm) developer's conference last week
