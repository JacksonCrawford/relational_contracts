i'm very optimistic. perhaps it's a danger, but i like to eat beef. it's the best meat.\"the german government wished that more people thought like gabelentz, a music student. mad cow mania quickly mushroomed into a major political issue early this week as the european union's commissioner for consumer affairs, david byrne, predicted in an interview with die welt that \"there will be other infections.\"der spiegel magazine quoted albert osterhaus of the netherlands, who sits on the eu's veterinary committee, saying that several dozen german cows could be infected and still not be showing signs of the disease.the sense of a problem that will only get bigger has led to an orgy of public self-recrimination. andrea fischer, germany's health minister, said: \"we deluded ourselves in germany.\"the berliner morgenpost agreed in a brisk attack on the government, writing: \"they made fools of us with the long-winded promises that germany is safe from bse.\"a look around the rest of europe might have disabused germans of that notion. already this year, france has reported 111 cases of bse, more than double last year's total, and ireland has also reported more than 100 cases this year. export controls are popping up right and left, with jordan banning any beef imports from europe, and switzerland putting a halt to the import of beef from anywhere.italian cattle breeders are concerned enough about bse that hundreds of them drove their tractors to the brenner pass border with austria in what they say is an attempt to stop the import of beef that could be contaminated, according to agi online. butchers in athens have stopped selling beef until more stringent bse tests are implemented.the eu, anxious to reassure the public, said last week that as of the first of the year, all mature cattle considered at risk will be subjected to a \"rapid screening test.\"another way to crack down will be to halt the practice of including remains of dead sheep in the feed cattle are given. germany may ban all use of farm feed containing animal matter, and the eu may follow suit. it will discuss the health crisis at its upcoming summit in nice starting next thursday.stephen dealer, a microbiologist who helped investigate bse in britain, told the daily telegraph: \"we are probably seeing the start of an epidemic in europe, and although it is impossible to predict its size, it will be bigger than we expect.\""}
