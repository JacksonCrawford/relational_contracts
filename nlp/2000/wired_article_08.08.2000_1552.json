standards: is outsourcing customer data analysis the same as passing the information to a third party? an analysis by chris oakes.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "08.08.2000 03:00 AM", "text": "disturbing behind-the-scenes activity at toysrus.com came to light last week: the company was whisking shoppers' personal information down an unmarked internet side road to a little-known data-processing firm. as customers browsed and shopped at the toy retailer, third-party data-analysis firm coremetrics was sucking name, address, and shopping cart information into its database.the discovery spurred a controversy over the role of this unseen third party -- as well as lawsuits targeting toysrus.com and coremetrics. the suits focused on the seemingly inflammatory fact that the hand-off was not mentioned in toysrus.com's privacy disclosures even though the information handed over was explicitly personal.but the alleged privacy transgression isn't as clear as it might seem. coremetrics was a contractor to toysrus.com, which was turning over its customer activity data for analysis to coremetrics. that outsourcing relationship between the two companies shed light on an area of relative obscurity in the debate over the acceptable ebb and flow of private information online.attorneys in one proposed class action lawsuit against toys 'r' us and coremetrics called the matter bigger than the doubleclick controversy. \"it's far worse than doubleclick,\" said bill doyle, attorney with milberg weiss. the firm has handled many privacy and consumer fraud cases.\"it may not be as widespread as a doubleclick or third-party advertisers, but it takes it to a new level,\" he added.ad network doubleclick, a ubiquitous third party on sites across the web, came under fire last july for plans to acquire an offline-marketing firm that owned a huge database of personally identifiable consumer data. if combined with anonymous cookies doubleclick placed on millions of computers, the company might have had an unprecedented ability to track users online.the controversy brought the role of third-party companies that interact with consumer information at websites into sharp focus. the federal trade commission and a consortium of ad networks recently came to agreement over self-regulatory privacy standards for third-party ad networks.but is coremetrics also a third party in addition to being toys 'r' us' outsourcing partner, and therefore subject to the same privacy rules?absolutely, as critics like doyle see it. \"we're not talking (about) search terms or just an id number, or stuff that may or may not get linked up later, we're talking everything,\" he said. \"your name, your address, your phone number, the ship-to names and addresses. that's a lot of information.\"but coremetrics counters that its relationship with websites like toysrus.com is being confused. the nature of its third-party relationship to client websites is different than that of an ad network firm.in addition to being much smaller in scope -- coremetrics provides data analysis services to approximately 40 customer websites -- the company says it does not collect and use customer data for its own business ends. instead, it processes the data for the websites to use themselves. coremetrics says it is contractually prohibited in its client deals from profiling individuals across multiple client sites.\"(the privacy concerns are) based on the assumption that we collect data across multiple sites with the intention of re-selling it to third parties, and that's just absolutely false,\" said brett hurt, coremetrics' ceo and co-founder. \"their data is going into our database, but it is their property.\"on that ground, the company plans to fight the lawsuits. \"we believe the cases have no merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves in these litigations,\" coremetrics spokesman dan dement said.privacy advocate jason catlett said concern over the issues misses the point. \"a company that outsources doesn't necessarily make its customers more vulnerable to privacy violations than a large company that processes the data in-house,\" catlett said.most people probably aren't aware that outsourcing of data processing is widespread, catlett said. but the devil is in the details of the company's privacy policy and its contract with the outsourcer. consumers can't see those contracts, just as they can't see any other contract between businesses.but there's a simple way to handle that, catlett said.\"the approach taken by most countries is a law requiring all companies to treat personal information fairly and to only use it for the purpose for which it was collected,\" catlett said. \"if this is breached, then the affected person has a direct cause of legal action. under such a regime, the outsourcing question becomes irrelevant, as it should be.\"he noted that phone companies have long outsourced the printing of their phone bills. if the printer sold customer-calling data, they would be in clear violation of decades-old telephone privacy laws. however, catlett said, recent u.s. law affecting offline outsourcing has gone in the wrong direction, because these laws are specifically carving out excessively broad exceptions for outsourcing.self-regulatory privacy seal program truste said providing notice remains the issue in the coremetrics case, no matter the nature of the third party. the industry group took the occasion to lambaste toyrsus.com for not joining the truste privacy seal program, which is meant to indicate a site's compliance with certain standards of user notice on the use of their data.\"shame on toysrus.com for not updating their privacy statement in the wake of legitimate concerns of their business practices,\" said truste spokesman dave steer.as a member, truste would have advised the company that \"while the letter of the law may be on their side, the spirit of the law isn't,\" he said. \"they may win the class action lawsuits in a court of law, but they are going to suffer reputation losses in the court of public opinion.\"coremetrics clients lucy.com and fusion.com, both truste members, have done much better in responding to the controversy, steer said. both worked with truste \"to quickly understand the concerns raised and diligently worked to address those concerns by updating their privacy disclosures,\" he said.the courts will sort out the various lawsuits, but it's clear that the privacy roadmap is still scant on many niggling details like outsourcing.\"the tragedy is,\" catlett said, \"that the courts and the class action lawyers are having to fight out questions on privacy rights that lawmakers should have addressed long ago.\""}
