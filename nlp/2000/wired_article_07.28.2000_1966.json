(ciena, incidentally, is suing corvis for patent infringement.)doug mceuen, an analyst at cahner's in-stat group, said that corvis may have an edge just because it's such an early-stage company and can devote itself to developing new products, rather than selling old ones. \"they're just a little bit ahead,\" mceuen said. \"they're planning for the next generation of networks, while the nortels and lucents, while still planning ahead, are cashing in big on what's going on today.\"several ipo market analysts, however, cautioned that corvis, like a lot of profitless companies in hot industries, is getting a little too much hoopla too early on.\"both the wireless area and optical networking are being valued by the market as if there are going to be enormous profits in the future,\" said jay ritter, a university of florida finance professor who tracks ipo performances. \"maybe that'll be the case, but i think the upside on the sector is limited given the high valuations.\"even corvis, it seems, underestimated the staggering initial demand for its shares. since first filing to sell shares in may, the company nearly tripled the size of its offering from $400,000 to $1.1 billion. even with the price hike, however, investors were still willing to pay more than twice the offering price.by not anticipating the level of interest in its stock, corvis missed out on more ipo cash than any firm in u.s. history, said ritter, who keeps a database of how much money companies leave on the table. runners-up include ups, goldman sachs, sycamore networks, and akamai technologies.peterson, however, pointed out that corvis's stock-price jump is likely to be short-lived.\"it's going to have to demonstrate quickly the ability to put product on the marketplace and to generate numbers that justify these numbers,\" he said. \"we've all seen too often that expectations do not translate into tangible results.\""}
