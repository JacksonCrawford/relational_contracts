(you can rerecord greetings in your own, more human tones.) other key features include microsoft outlook-compatible speak-and-dial voice recognition for names and extension numbers, and an intercom function between internal phones. plus each cybergenie base unit works with up to 10 handsets.of course, there is a catch. to access the higher-level features, whether on the road or in the office, you will need to leave your pc on at all times. when it's off, you are left with a normal cordless phone. still, cybergenie's got everything you need to make the spare room off the kitchen feel just like a cube - for a much lower price than a corporate phone system.cybergenie: $499; additional handsets $129 each. cygnion: (877) 438 4364, street credinterplanetary dance feverbackhandheld computingtake me to the bridgerhyme machineanother frame jobviolent typeconference call in a bottlereadmemusicthe gift of fearjust shoot mebetter red than deadjust outta betasound switcherwingo-ramapassword snatcherpalm camwelcome to the guilty pleasuredomecontributors"}
