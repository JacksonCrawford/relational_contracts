napster ... and wendy's is looking for the best song about a hamburger. brad king gets down with the week in digital music news.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "07.14.2000 03:00 AM", "text": "well, people are going to be paying for the music, but the artists still aren't going to get paid -- and not because of some evil music rep this time. two music groups are putting their music on the web to help raise money for charitable causes.sinead o'connor and thomas dolby are teaming up to produce a song from studios around the globe in hopes of raising money for war child -- a charity that helps impoverished children in war zones.with the help of such notables as tim dread, of dreadzone, and matt black, of coldcut, the group will be covering bob marley's them belly full (but we hungry). listeners will pay 1 british pound (us$1.50) to hear the song, with all proceeds going to the charity fund.\"the internet has revolutionized so many aspects of our lives, and by helping to pioneer this single, we're helping to maximize the potential of the net as a major fund-raising tool for charities in the future,\" said caroline horner, head of brand and communications for magex -- one of the companies involved in the promotion, in a written statement.more controversial than o'connor's participation (a first for sinead) is record label invention music group which will post cloning einstein's music on mp3.com.every time somebody listens to their song, the band will donate 50 percent of its earnings from the mp3.com's payback for playback online listening program plus $1.00 from each cd sale to ten charities, including the justice for police officer daniel faulkner foundation. mumia abu-jamal, a death row inmate who has garnered international support for his release, was convicted of killing faulkner in 1981.\"with all the support jamal has received from a small army of celebrities who often choose to conveniently overlook the facts and the evidence in the name of 'social justice,' the band felt it was time for someone in the artistic community to try to give a voice to the real victims of the crime -- officer faulkner and his family,\" said jeff james beck and joe dougherty of invention music group, in a statement.---limpin' into summer: first launch.com buys the warped tour, now napster is going one better -- sponsoring not one, but two summer concert tours.the tour comes complete with an interactive exhibit on the \"summer tour 2000\" bus, a roof-top dj and graffiti artists. of course, it wouldn't be napster unless the folks on the bus were giving away free stuff like mp3 players and -- here's a shock -- gift certificates to purchase cds at local record stores.earlier in the week while ceo hank barry was testifying in the senate, band limp bizkit was out on the road making the first stop on its \"back to the basics\" tour.those concerts are free, of course, because napster is footing the bill for the whole show. concert organizers will announce tour stops about a day ahead of time, with wrist-bands being passed out on a first-come, first-serve basis.---wap man: hoping to bridge the gap between the internet, mp3 player technology, and cellphones, hithive announced the mobile music service for sharing music among wireless devices. the services will enable customers to share music collections, listen to music, create play lists, and even purchase music through their wireless devices.but building that bridge will have to wait -- the service is only available to businesses right now.---the burger roll: in just another reminder that the dot-com music revolution is everywhere, rollingstone.com and wendy's restaurant chain have teamed up in an effort to find the best new song about hamburgers.but these two aren't going at it alone, they've also roped in tnn/cmt -- that's the nashville network and country music television -- to join them for the great \"wendy's search for sizzlin' sounds\" contest this summer.bands are invited to submit their materials, either through snail mail or at the official sizzlin' website.---the daryl g. berg shoutout: say what you will about hilary rosen, the head of the recording industry association of america, but the lady is one cool customer.the much-embattled rosen spent the last few weeks in the belly of the beast, traveling the country and meeting with the journalists who have spent the better part of three years knocking her around as the labels slowly meandered into the digital music space.for her efforts, she was rewarded by getting plucked out of the audience earlier this week by senator orrin hatch (r-utah), the chairman of the senate judiciary committee, during the ballyhooed hearings on the future of digital music.she wavered a bit under the senator's questions, but let's face it -- after spending time being skewered, and then attacked by surprise, who can blame her for some of her side-stepping? and jeez, who knew that orrin and some of the cats on that panel knew anything about the internet?"}
