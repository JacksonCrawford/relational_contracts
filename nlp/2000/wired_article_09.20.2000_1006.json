the network is purely line-of-sight and won't penetrate trees and houses; and there could be interference problems with signals bouncing off buildings.on the plus side, the group has access to a sophisticated network-mapping tool called web stalker, which was commissioned for the troubled millennium dome project. web stalker will generate a 3-d map of the network to help users find the nearest access point.stevens is not alone in his desire to create community-run wireless networks. similar efforts are underway in seattle, boston and san francisco.in seattle, matt westervelt is trying to coordinate a similar 802.11-standard wireless network in the city's residential capitol hill district.the plan is to allow free wireless access to net-connected computers at home, westervelt said. he had been a subscriber to metricom's ricochet service, but tired of the monthly charges.\"we're building our own infrastructure,\" said westervelt, a systems administrator for real networks. \"you shouldn't have to pay a monthly fee to be on the airwaves. you should be able to do this for free.\"like stevens, westervelt has experience jerry-rigging guerrilla networks. a few years ago he shared a t1 line with his neighbors in seattle's pioneer square by stringing ethernet cables through windows and across alleyways.westervelt and his colleagues have been running about half a dozen independent wireless nodes from apartments in the area since june, but face the problem of hooking them up into one seamless network.he said they need more volunteers to fill in the gaps or someone on a neighboring hill whom they can bounce signals off of. the group also is toying with the idea of charging users who don't contribute to the network by running a node.seattle wireless recently linked up with xlan, a project started by greg daly, an engineering student at the university of washington who is designing homemade booster antennae for 802.11 networks.daly said his designs will allow broadband-connected users to share their connections with others up to 20 kilometers (12.42 miles) away by setting up inexpensive base stations hooked to a booster antenna.\"right now a lot of people have cable or dsl connections, but people down the street don't because of distances,\" he said. \"we hope to help eliminate that.\"daly has designs for a 4-kilometer directional antenna that costs about $20, and a 20-kilometer directional antenna based on a used satellite dish. he expects to publish detailed plans for the antennae on his site within a month.in boston and surrounding areas, guerrilla net members are creating a decentralized, wireless alternative to the internet.\"the purpose is to ensure that the flow of information is not obstructed, captured, analyzed, modified, or logged,\" said brian oblivion, a member of computer security site l0pht industries.\"this requires a networking fabric which lies outside of governments, commercial internet service providers, telecommunications companies, and dubious internet regulatory committees,\" he wrote in an email.oblivion said that while the project is centered in boston, it has \"hundreds\" of interested parties worldwide, particularly in the united states and europe. if there are enough people in a particular location, they set up a \"cell,\" oblivion said."}
