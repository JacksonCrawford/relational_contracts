good reason to smile. plastic spacers offer a clear alternative to wire braces and ugly nicknames. by kristen philipkoski.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "science", "type": "article", "timestamp": "01.18.2000 03:00 AM", "text": "clear, plastic retainers created with three-dimensional modeling may spell an end to the proverbial metal mouth. align technologies has developed a system called invisalign to straighten adult teeth using a series of plastic retainers called \"aligners.\" at around us$6,000 for an 18-month treatment, the cost and the amount of time involved in the treatment is nearly the same as ordinary braces, only without the metallic grin.\"for the last 100 years, orthodontic innovation has been entirely focused on wires and brackets. what we're doing is a complete leap in technology away from that, and what allows us to do it is the computer graphics,\" said kelsey wirth, president of align.invisalign incorporates advanced 3d imaging to map out a precise treatment plan for straightening teeth.first, the orthodontist takes an impression of the teeth. it's sent to align, where it's scanned to create a 3d model.\"we capture the 3d geometry of your teeth, and manipulate the graphic to perform what we call a 'virtual treatment,'\" wirth said.technicians then create a computerized movie showing the gradual movement of the teeth from beginning to end. once the orthodontist reviews and approves the movie, align creates the aligners to match each stage of movement.\"the core of what we do is really software development, but we are a unique mix of computer engineering, orthodontics, r & d, and manufacturing,\" wirth said.so far, patients report positive results.\"as someone who has had braces before, this was a much better, less painful experience than traditional braces,\" said kara sanchez, who participated in a clinical study of invisalign and is in her 18th and last phase of treatment.sanchez had braces on her top teeth for four years as an adolescent, and is using invisalign for her bottom teeth. \"it really straightened out the whole structure of my teeth,\" she said.she said the treatment was less painful than traditional braces, and more convenient because the wearer can take them out when necessary.follow-up visits to the orthodontist were also less of a hassle, sanchez said.\"i don't love doing molds, but the key thing was i only had to do one -- the computer does the modifications,\" she said.the idea for a treatment like invisalign has been around since the forties, wirth said, but orthodontists were not able to create retainers with adequate precision.\"computer graphics allow us to design multiple stages with great accuracy,\" she said.the aligners must be worn at all times except during eating, brushing, and flossing. each aligner is worn for about two weeks, then replaced by the next in the series, which can include up to 18 retainers.remarkably, the idea for invisalign didn't come from a dentist or orthodontist. align ceo zia chishti was working for morgan stanley and wearing traditional braces when he first thought of the concept.\"zia was meeting with ceos of companies looking 15 [years old],\" wirth said. \"when he got the braces off and got a clear plastic retainer, he noticed that when he didn't wear it for five or seven days, his teeth would shift, then he'd cram it back in and they'd shift back.\"the business partners figured a similar retainer could actually straighten teeth if they could develop a series that was precisely measured and individualized.\"what we're doing is really transforming the way adults think of orthodontic treatment. the first thing that usually comes to mind is 'metal mouth.' now, adults who always wished their teeth were straighter have an alternative,\" wirth said.about two dozen patients have now successfully completed full treatments, and dozens more are in the midst of treatment.mayona engdahl, a registered dental assistant and treatment coordinator in san francisco, has set up five patients with invisalign so far, and expects to see many more.\"i see it being popular because i have a lot of patients who walk away from braces simply because they cannot face either their business clients with braces on or their social life with braces on,\" she said.unfortunately, the treatment won't work for possibly the most self-conscious portion of the population that often needs braces: adolescents. qualified patients must be over 18 because the procedure only works if all of the patient's teeth are permanent.the treatment also requires a considerable amount of responsibility on the patient's part.\"it requires a lot of compliance. you have to wear the retainer all the time except when you're eating because if they're not in your mouth, they're not working,\" engdahl said.nevertheless, wirth expects to find plenty of adult customers.\"ninety percent of all adults could benefit from some type of orthodontic treatment,\" wirth said. \"that's 100 million people between 25 and 49, but today only 400,000 adults get braces every year. there's a huge unmet need out there.\"orthodontists must complete a four-hour training in order to work with invisalign, and the company said it has trained about 1,000 to date.invisalign plans to publish the results of its clinical trials by the end of this year."}
