(a 1999 federal law limits the circumstances in which \"telecommunications carriers\" can disclose personal information about customers.)not all companies offered a rosy picture. marc lemaitre, director of technology strategy at nextel communications, says that american firms are late in addressing privacy problems.\"the stakes are now higher. it's no longer just about digital footprints,\" lemaitre said. \"it's about what store i visited first and second and third. my concern, and i don't want to be an alarmist here, is that wireless is already doing this stuff.\"\"we're late for the ball, and we don't have a dress, and now is not the time for a first fitting,\" lemaitre said.privacy times' hendricks said he hoped to see ftc mandate opt-in rules, set out an \"enforcement\" procedure, and require notification of the purposes for which information will be used before it is collected.in a statement distributed before the meeting, ftc commissioner mozelle thompson did his best to offend nobody: \"i think we all recognize that this is a rapidly changing area. accordingly, our responses should be creative, flexible and organic -- built with an ability to embrace change.\"at the same time, however, i hope that we will have laid the foundation for a continuing discussion of these issues in the coming months.\""}
