a tired speaker tends to slur and mumble words.it's impossible to say which program is best. with each new version, the products become harder and harder to differentiate. that said, i found naturallyspeaking preferred -- version 5 priced at $199 -- the most comfortable to use. the software, which has a clean interface and comprehensive user's manual, is easy to work with.still, the product is far from perfect. for example, it's frustrating how slowly it scrolls down a web page. for people who surf the web frequently but don't want to use a mouse, this is a drawback.dragon senior product manager jeff foley said the \"scroll down\" command was designed to suit the average customer's need. and the average user is probably a good deal more patient than a deadline-driven reporter.still, at least you could scroll down without a mouse. this is not a feature that voice xpress includes. and the way that viavoice allows you to scroll down is so convoluted as to not be worth it.with naturallyspeaking 5, it is even possible to drag around a mouse, hands-free. however, mouse dragging turns out to be a tedious process, full of less-than-intuitive commands like \"mousegrid six three drag.\"probably the biggest bummer about naturallyspeaking is its inability to handle macros unless you shell out the estimated $700 for the professional edition. viavoice and voice xpress, however, both permit personal commands and dictation shortcuts.viavoice -- release 8 pro edition priced at $199.95 -- has other perks as well. the software comes with a comfortable plantronics sr-1 headset and is equipped with a new \"nothing but speech\" feature. this is extremely helpful for those who sputter out \"ums\" and \"ahs\" while thinking and talking.viavoice also allows for greater computer control than the other products. if you're busy dictating a memo and you suddenly remember that you forgot to email your boss about the memo, you can say \"send an email to boss\" and viavoice will launch microsoft outlook and set up an email addressed to the boss. viavoice also allows a user to close a window of a program that one is not even in.voice xpress -- professional version 5 priced at $149.99 -- also has benefits. the software has the best text-to-speech feature currently offered by the three companies. the playback voice has shed most of the creepy qualities associated with the typical computer generated voice.the newest version also features a snazzy tutorial in the form of a virtual \"caf\u00e9\" that is inhabited by a smartly dressed teacher named jane. it's cute, but make sure the volume on your computer is turned down when you fire it up. wander away from your cube for a minute and your entire office may be treated to a very loud -- and somewhat agitated -- jane asking, \"are you there? where did you go? did you leave to get a cup of coffee?\"another cool thing that voice xpress features are the so-called \"natural language technology commands\" that allow a user to say commands in more than one way. for example, to open an application, say \"begin,\" \"start,\" \"bring up\" or \"launch.\"ultimately, each individual has to decide which product will work best for him or her. a writer -- who's apt to use word processing, email programs, and the internet -- may prefer naturallyspeaking. an accountant -- who would likely also use excel -- might go for viavoice instead. mac users, by the way, have no options at all and have to go with viavoice.whichever product you choose, be prepared to be frustrated, be prepared to spend a lot of time training the software, and be prepared to be pleasantly surprised. voice recognition software probably won't increase your production if your production isn't impaired in the first place, but if you can't type and mouse the way you'd like to, it can be something of a miracle.(editor's note: the author of these stories, lynn burke, has repetitive stress injury and wrote all the stories using voice-recognition software.)"}
