therapy experiments will continue. although problems have occurred in trials, including one death, gene therapy may be some patients' only hope. by kristen philipkoski.", "author": "wired staff",

on the research. the recombinant dna advisory committee met from 8 march through 10 march in washington to discuss ways to better safeguard patients during gene therapy experiments.the 15-member committee, while unable to come to terms on exactly how gene therapy experiments would continue, did agree they should be allowed, in spite of public concern and a death last year due to experimental gene therapy.jeremy rifkin, president of the foundation for economic trends in washington, made a plea for a moratorium on certain types of gene therapy experiments, but the rac rejected his arguments.\"the working group does not consider the proposal from the foundation for economic trends to be necessary or helpful to the goals of improving safety and strengthening oversight in gene transfer research at this time,\" the group, headed by bioethicist ruth macklin of albert einstein college of medicine in new york, said in a statement.gene therapy is a technique that attempts to cure or treat disease by injecting a healthy gene into the patient. many experiments use an altered virus called adenovirus to carry the gene into the body.the adenovirus was used in a gene therapy experiment in september that killed 18-year-old jesse gelsinger at the university of pennsylvania -\u2013 the first known death caused by gene therapy.\"in the final analysis, biotech research will be better served if we implement a ... moratorium on the use of viral vectors in ... gene therapy trials,\" rifkin said.since gelsinger's death, gene therapy has come under a magnifying glass. the fda did an investigation of the penn lab and said it found several failures to comply with nih and fda procedures. the penn lab wrote two letters back to the fda defending its experiments.at least two other gene therapy labs also have been shut down. following a letter from the nih urging gene therapy labs to report any adverse events in their experiments, 970 were reported last year and 464 so far this year. the majority were not considered to be serious.meanwhile, patients with rare and untreatable diseases and their families said they want the trials to continue, since it may be their only hope.the fda and the nih last week came up with new guidelines to more stringently monitor gene therapy experiments involving humans, and started a new series of symposiums to help researchers exchange gene therapy safety information.the rac is just one of the committees that advises the nih regarding gene therapy experiments. the national bioethics advisory committee also held a meeting recently to discuss the oversight of gene therapy experiments by the nih and the fda.\"the most important thing from the testimony that the commission heard was the degree of importance that the commissioners place on good communication between the fda and the nih regarding each of their own oversight responsibilities,\" said eric meslin, executive director of nbac.meslin agreed that gene therapy, although still not proven to be successful in humans, should continue in experiments.\"while certainly interested in what happened to jesse gelsinger and that tragedy, the brac is focused on how a federal agency can protect human subjects ... while insuring that human research goes forward,\" meslin said.patients with rare diseases such as ornithine transcarbamylase disorder, the liver disorder that gelsinger had, and parents of children with canavan disease, which damages brain cells, still hope that the oversight questions can be answered and that federal agencies can agree upon a set of solid rules.the parents of 5-year-old lindsay karlin, who has canavan disease and has participated in several gene therapy studies, made a plea at the rac meeting for the research to continue.after her first gene therapy treatment -- which used a virus to carry the gene -- karlin's parents said she showed a dramatic improvement, although it eventually wore off.\"she became a new child. this happened within a month of gene therapy,\" karlin's father said.each time their daughter got a new treatment, the karlins noticed dramatic changes, and doctors saw physical changes in her brain.\"my daughter has been helped by the gene, and had she not had the gene, i believe she would be dead now,\" karlin's mother said.most members of the agencies that oversee gene experiments seem to be leaning toward continuing with the research.\"cases like the ones we hear about that cause us to question the goals of science and medicine, and how we can assure those goals are consistent with good ethics, should give everyone pause,\" nbac's meslin said.\"i'm optimistic, but there's work to be done to make sure the system is sound and safe and secure for the subjects to volunteer themselves as well as for the agencies who conduct the research.\"reuters contributed to this report."}
