next up, he said, are germany, korea, and japan.\"part of our globalization strategy is to build joint-venture relationships with other entrepreneurs in non-english-speaking countries, who may not have had the same opportunities,\" adler continued. \"let's face it, you don't have the equivalent of silicon valley in beijing. so being able to meet different people and share knowledge is important.\"because technology development and access varies greatly from region to region, the summit organizers chose to rely on foolproof, tested technologies so that as many participants as possible could play, said martin best, vice president of interactive at poptronik, an entertainment-oriented multimedia firm in toronto.\"it's very easy to program the latest technologies that cater to the north american world, where everyone has access. but as an international, not-for-profit agency, it's the role of the ild to help everyone,\" best said.the e-summit consists mainly of a basic webcast and ongoing, scrolling-text interaction built upon a stripped-down, multi-user domain game.the multiple-user and text-based qualities of muds, which have been around for 20 years, may not make for flashy game-playing. but they seem oddly suited to real-time business communication between many people in far-flung, inconsistently wired locations, since fast internet connections aren't necessary.\"i've done a lot of business over text media,\" said matthew mihaly, ceo of achaea, in san francisco.mihaly donated the skeleton of his established indie mud, \"achaea: dreams of divine lands,\" to the e-summit cause. \"for the hong kong investors for achaea, all the conversation was over email. i never spoke to them,\" mihaly said.entrepreneurs in less-developed regions can access the e-summit in places such as nairobi, new delhi, amman, and lima, through mirror sites run by various agencies including the u.n. development fund for women.some key components of the summit also have their own simple but effective virtual counterparts.the trade show at the world trade center is being held in a conference room packed with booths and computers, among which participants can wander to chat each other up. online at the ild website, the so-called virtual trade show is a list of links to their companies' web presences, with brief descriptions of their business and of what they still want.this list --\u00ad a quick count turned up over 400 entries sorted into 10 categories --\u00ad has been posted for months to encourage networking before the summit, and will remain up afterward.and much of the information to be taught at hands-on workshops has been stored on two cd-roms that are free to all participants.one cd-rom contains a database of investment profiles for united nations countries \u00ad-- gross national products, procedures for visas, economic-system quirks --\u00ad and links for up-to-date data in the future. the other disc shows how to construct a formal memorandum of understanding.the past six summits have attracted nearly 1,800 young entrepreneurs, the ild website says.\"ild wants to help emerging entrepreneurs from developing countries to build international ventures and share knowledge. technology enables us to forge joint-venture opportunities much more efficiently and cheaply,\" said summit secretary general sujit chowdhury, who founded both the york university-affiliated ild six years ago and the summit itself as a york u. grad student.to attend this year's summit, ild required entrepreneurs to be younger than 42 (the median age of participants is 34), to have owned a business, and to have revenue from that business surpass $300,000 in developed countries and $75,000 in developing countries, chowdhury said."}
