should network solutions be responsible for ensuring that nike opts for the highest security levels available? \"laws have to be designed to enable people to know who the target of an investigation should be,\" said mangalam.in any event, the grounds for complaint against nike look shaky at best, said mangalam.for its part, amazon.com, which won a preliminary injunction last year preventing smith from using the amazon.gr domain, seemed to wonder whether smith's charges against nike were made in entirely good faith.or as amazon.com spokeswoman patti smith put it, \"you're right to look at whatever he sends you with a critical eye.\""}
