week. as the new post takes hold in corporate america, online privacy moves past adolescence. by chris oakes.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp":

over internet privacy practices. they also had some hiring advice to go along with the admonition. \"hire a chief privacy officer,\" advised dave steer, spokesman for industry watchdog truste.chief privacy what?chief privacy officer, or cpo. get used to the term, as more and more companies are heeding steer's advice.the sign of the times is nowhere more apparent than in the newborn association of corporate privacy officers, which was formed last week in hackensack, new jersey.the group announced its incorporation friday and listed its founding members, which included cpos from credit firms, websites, insurance companies, and others.\"if you think you can navigate the internet without having a privacy guide, you're in big trouble,\" said alan westin, head of the new organization. \"you need somebody in front of the boat who knows how to look.\"as he's peering from the bow, the cpo promises to push online privacy beyond what has mostly been an accidental process of \"discovery and recovery.\"in the typical privacy muck-up to date, a website is discovered to be misusing personal information, the breach is publicized, and finally the company moves to fix the problem and apologize to customers -- and hope that the next data-privacy thread to unravel isn't its own.that's not exactly a bulletproof, long-term method for sealing data holes and protecting business reputations in the suddenly hot-button and newly politicized atmosphere surrounding electronic privacy.at the very least, the cpo gives online privacy its first signs of chin stubble and a deeper voice. from microsoft to doubleclick to dot coms, companies are filling the post with people who have the authority to bend the chief executive's ear.\"we decided -- through an increasing importance of the issue, and through an increased influence in the company of my work and my strategy in this area -- to formalize the position,\" said microsoft cpo richard purcell. prior to being installed as cpo, purcell served as microsoft's \"data practices director.\"he said approximately 15 people now work on privacy at microsoft domestically, plus a few others internationally. the task force is built with representatives from each microsoft business division, operating unit, and sales organization.founding members of the acpo organizing committee include privacy officers from american express, dun & bradstreet, go.com, nationwide insurance, eds, pricewaterhouse coopers, equifax, image data, citigroup, mutual of omaha, bell atlantic, delta airlines, royal bank, and sabre.acpo was created by the center for social and legal research and is an outgrowth of privacy & american business, which westin also heads.westin said cpos will have to battle with marketing and product manager types, who often fail to consider the data-privacy implications of new products or services.\"the dominant business model on the internet is 'we must know you to serve you,'\" westin said. \"and the dominant consumer model on the internet is 'you can't know me unless i want you to.'\" the two positions are on a collision course, and the cpo must make it his mission to fix that, he said.\"the chief privacy officer is going to be in competition with the people who say, 'i have the thing that's going to make our bottom line sing.' and in that fight the money wins -- unless the chief privacy officer says 'hey, this company's name and stock is at risk and if we want to get the hit that doubleclick got in the market, yeah, we can do that.'\"the acpo dictates that the cpo must report to and have the immediate backing of a company's ceo to give it power and influence. \"if (a privacy problem) can't be fixed, the chief privacy officer has to recommend that the product not go forward,\" westin said.\"if this is a low-level, low-budget position reporting to the janitor in charge of the building (position), you don't have anything.\"privacy advocate simson garfinkel, author of database nation: the death of privacy in the 21st century, agreed.\"just like having a corporate security officer, it's important to have one person who's ultimately responsible for personal information and how the companies deal with it,\" garfinkel said. \"the position can be just a show position or it can be a real position -- and that depends on the company.\"infomediary alladvantage.com's cpo ray everett church said the goal of the cpo should be to strike a balance. he said alladvantage has come up with ways to use personal information to give value to a third party without violating people's privacy.church said the company has \"achieved more value for the consumer, and gotten a more valuable product in the end for ourselves and for our partners.\"from both sides of the privacy debate, the emergence of the cpo is seen as a positive trend.\"it's clearly a milestone on the road to success,\" garfinkel said. \"it's marvelous that corporations are doing this. it's really, really good stuff.\"garfinkel's sentiment was echoed by the electronic privacy information center, which has been an ardent advocate of consumer privacy and skeptical of industry self-regulation. \"we think it's a good trend,\" said executive director marc rotenberg. \"it's long been part of the thinking about how you get privacy done.\"yet the acpo's westin isn't about to label the emergence of the cpo as a coup of the advocacy movement. instead, sheer business sensibility -- bottom-line, stock market-driven fear -- has pushed companies into proactive privacy thinking, he said.\"one day you'll pick up the papers and the stock market will be hit, and there'll be a thousand points taken off the internet stocks, because at that moment the tumblers will click,\" he said.that's a situation any sane company would presumably want to avoid.still, \"there's always a risk that a cpo can end up spending more time doing public relations than privacy protection,\" rotenberg said. \"the measure of an effective chief privacy officer is their ability to work with consumers and clients to resolve privacy problems, and also to work within the company to make sure the company is adhering to privacy rules.\"garfinkel said microsoft's purcell has a strong position in the company and a good track record. \"he reports directly to the chief operating officer, and it's a very important position, and purcell has a lot of leadership inside microsoft,\" garfinkel said.despite purcell\u2019s presence, microsoft has still found itself under fire for gathering data that privacy advocates said it shouldn't. that's a discrepancy between the software and service side of the company, garfinkel said.\"their products have never really taken security very seriously,\" he said. \"there's a difference between having bugs and having good practices, and from what i've seen so far the practices have been pretty good.\"as companies like microsoft work to even out privacy philosophy with practices, the privacy debate should move to a new level, at least in the corporate sphere.\"it's not bad to characterize it as a mile marker,\" said epic's rotenberg. \"we're assembling a puzzle here, and it's clear that having a privacy official within organizations is part of the puzzle. but there are still a lot more pieces.\"\"the critical piece that's missing are the legal rules that provide the baseline standards for consumers. we're moving in that direction.\""}
