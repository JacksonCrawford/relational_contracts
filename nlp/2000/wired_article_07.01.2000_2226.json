(there's no map display, however.) better yet, a soft female voice warns you about approaching turns and tells you just when to take them. the travelpilot, which uses gps supplemented with a gyrocompass and speed and backup sensors, knew where i was within a car length; other navigation systems i've tried were off by half a block or more. like all good systems, the travelpilot recalculated my route if i missed or shrugged off one of its directions; unlike others, it could ask me where the congestion or roadblock was on my route and make better decisions about a detour. it also displayed the angle of most turns closer to reality, rather than showing them all as 90 degrees.the routes it picked weren't always as good as a local cabbie could have given me, but the blaupunkt got me almost anyplace i wanted to go reasonably quickly. the local-map disc had one bug: while it knew when i was driving on route 22 (the main drag in new jersey), it couldn't find that road when i asked for directions to it. but since blaupunkt logs customer complaints, that'll likely be fixed on the next disc.navigating didn't interfere with listening to the radio or the cd player. the travelpilot even retained some navigational ability when i swapped the map disc for a music cd, though operation became slower and less precise.i'm not a guy who won't stop for directions, but it's handier having them online. my only gripe is travelpilot's price, which is more than i can afford. still, it's less expensive than most aftermarket navigation systems - and far cheaper than the audis and mercedes that offer travelpilot built in.travelpilot rns 149: $1,799.95 with one local-map disc; $225 each for discs that cover other parts of the us, canada, and europe. blaupunkt: (800) 950 2528, street crede-puppet mastergene geniusgrowing up valleyliterary devicecheck in and log oncyber babethe ultimate sight managerreadmemusicjuke jerkthe pleasures of urban decaydvd without bordersjust outta betabuck stops hereblaupunkt's lost and foundcontributors"}
