why not solid-state optical ones?unfortunately, conceiving such a chip hasn't been easy. photons don't behave like electrons, which can be shepherded down wires, stopping and starting on command like a well-behaved boy scout troop. photons are more like hyperactive children. switch on the average lightbulb and photons pop into existence spontaneously, race away in all directions, and bounce off the walls before they encounter some dark-colored object, which absorbs them, causing them to vanish as mysteriously as they appeared. all of which makes mirrors a natural choice for lucent's optical router: at the high speeds required by telecommunications, a mirror has always been the best way to interrupt and redirect a wayward beam of photons. until now.after seven years of unprecedented collaboration, engineers and theorists at mit have produced the first designs for photonic processing chips, although these devices aren't referred to as chips. they go by the cumbersome and slightly misleading term photonic band-gap crystals - they aren't crystalline on an atomic level, the way salt crystals or quartz crystals are. instead, they're built on a slightly larger scale out of clusters of atoms arrayed in a regular pattern with spaces between them. think of a jungle gym, and you have a rough idea of the 3-d structure. one slice of it would be comparable to the microscopic pattern coating the surface of a morpho wing.despite its open structure, this crystal exercises an unusual power over photons. logic suggests that photons should pass through the crystal as easily as air wafting through a window screen, but if the 3-d crystalline geometry is designed just so, it creates an environment where some photonic quantum energy states, in effect, hit the wall. while most colors in the spectrum penetrate freely, a forbidden few are treated like gate-crashers. with these bands of light, the crystal behaves like a mirror, even though it's full of holes. this photonic band-gap crystal is the optical equivalent of an electrical semiconductor, and telecommunications networks are only the first of many potential applications with far-reaching possibilities.if you double the size of the crystal structure, it works with waves that are twice as long - and these waves don't have to be visible light. a coin-sized band-gap crystal can act upon radio waves; a bread-box-sized filter will block a range of sound waves. scale it even larger, and a band-gap filter could theoretically obstruct ocean waves - or even the seismic waves in an earthquake. this obscure, quirky creation could enhance a vast range of products, including cell phone antennas, home insulation, standard office paper, satellite defense systems, and audio components. it could become the technology behind everything from smart highway sound barriers and equipment that reduces beach erosion to funny-looking candy bars and computers that run hundreds of times faster than those we have today, while generating hardly any heat.already, labs in 27 countries are pursuing research into photonic band-gap crystals. in the us, darpa has issued millions in research grants. at least eight government-funded facilities and more than 40 universities are involved, along with corporations such as nec, rockwell, lucent, and agilent. last year, clarendon photonics became one of the first startups to secure funding for development of a marketable product, with sevin rosen providing the initial capital. mit continues to play a central role: in january, nanovation technologies, which specializes in optical telecommunications systems, promised to establish a new microphotonics facility on campus, with a grant of $90 million over six years. \"this agreement is the largest ever negotiated with mit,\" says nanovation cto gary bjorklund.pierre wiltzius, director of semiconductor physics at lucent's bell labs, sees the band-gap effect going far beyond lasers. \"in the last century, we had the electronic revolution; the next century will witness the photonic revolution,\" he says. \"we'll see things we haven't even started to dream about.\"the idea for band-gap crystals originated more than a decade ago in the imagination of ucla electrical engineering professor eli yablonovitch. while he was at bellcore in 1986, yablonovitch started thinking about the fundamental nature of light. \"it comes into existence through spontaneous emission,\" he says, \"and i wondered how to prevent that.\" in other words, if he could interfere with the spontaneous, uncontrollable nature of photons, he might be able to convert them into particles that, like electrons, are easily manipulated.__band-gap crystals look like micron layers of lincoln logs, but they tame otherwise uncontrollable photons like the optical equivalent of a semiconductor. and labs around the world have seen the light. __yablonovitch wasn't the only one harboring this dream: even though fiber-optic communications were in their infancy, it was already clear that a general-purpose optical computer would have significant advantages in almost any application. because each electron passing through a silicon chip generates heat, the faster a computer runs, the hotter it gets. that's why modern cpus are mounted with fans, and why some supercomputers require refrigeration systems. photons, on the other hand, hardly generate any heat in data processing because they tend not to interact with their surroundings. consequently, a 100 percent photonic computer could run 10 to 100 times faster, with virtually no heat-related problems.the prospect of cool-running computers made optical computing a hot concept in the '80s. in 1986, bell labs heightened the anticipation by announcing an optical transistor. but the invention turned out to require breakthroughs in materials science before a working component could be put to practical use. years passed, and optical computing lost its luster when it failed to deliver on the hype. researchers rechristened the field photonics to shake off the lingering stigma.yablonovitch persevered, relatively sure that a form of crystalline structure could be developed to manipulate photons. \"no one knew how to calculate what the crystal should look like, so we used the edisonian method - trial and error. we tried many crystal structures, all failures,\" he says, laughing. \"i have the first one hanging in my office.\"after working on the problem for five years, yablonovitch came up with a softball-sized prototype that worked with microwaves - the centimeters-long packets of energy that zap our food and transmit radio, telephone, and tv signals. but to process light, he needed to downsize the structure to be comparable to the wavelength of light itself.like sculptors working to remove chips from a block of stone (a subtractive process) or, conversely, assembling small pieces such as daubs of clay (an additive process), engineers can make this kind of crystalline structure by creating holes in a solid block or by stacking tiny objects in a regular pattern with gaps between them. on the scale yablonovitch was contemplating, neither approach was feasible - everything would be too small. (in fact, in 1990 the prospect of working on such a scale seemed so daunting that john maddox, then editor of nature, wrote an article titled \"photonic band-gaps bite the dust.\")meanwhile, at mit, theoretical physicist john joannopoulos was excited by one of yablonovitch's early papers on the subject. \"immediately i thought, aha!\" he recalls. \"this is so similar to a semiconductor, we should be able to do something really neat with it.\"joannopoulos has always liked a challenge. the son of greek immigrants who settled in new york (his father was a playwright, his mother a psychologist), joannopoulos decided on his career while still in high school. \"i wanted to be a physicist,\" he says, \"because it was my hardest subject. i didn't like all those experiments. you know, hooke's law, and objects sliding down an inclined plane - it's so darned boring! but it was a challenge, so i wanted to defeat it.\"eventually he became interested in quantum mechanics, obtaining a phd at uc berkeley and studying condensed matter theory. \"the novelty of it attracted me. if you discover something in a new area, you have a piece of knowledge that no one had before.\"in the early '90s joannopoulos got a chance to break ground in the area of photonic band-gap crystals, because virtually no other theorist would get involved. as for the seemingly impossible task of building the things, that wasn't his department - joannopoulos was the architect envisioning how a photonic band-gap crystal should look. down the line, when engineers figured out how to take the blueprint and build the structure, he would be able to tell them every detail, sparing them the trial-and-error process that had occupied eli yablonovitch for so long.devising a 3-d array with the necessary properties was somewhat harder than joannopoulos had imagined. but, collaborating with his graduate students, he finally did it. in 1998, their work was conclusively validated when scientists at sandia national laboratories constructed the first photonic band-gap crystal in accordance with joannopoulos' theoretical specifications.shawn lin, a physicist at sandia, had wanted to build a crystal for some time. like joannopoulos, he was a theorist and didn't have a background in materials science. however, he did know jim fleming - also at sandia - who had worked with silicon for 10 years, fabricating chips and nanoscale mems devices. \"i specialize in creating three-dimensional structures,\" says fleming. \"i had no background in photonics, but i could see it was relatively straightforward to make what shawn wanted using silicon.\"fleming chose a combination of additive and subtractive approaches: first he etched microscopic grooves in a layer of silicon dioxide and filled the grooves with polysilicon, leaving a smooth layer of polysilicon on top of the silicon dioxide. he then etched grooves in the polysilicon at right angles to the first set of grooves and filled them with more silicon dioxide, this time leaving a smooth layer of silicon dioxide over the grooves. he repeated this process - adding layer upon layer - then dissolved the silicon dioxide with hydrofluoric acid, leaving a stack of polysilicon strips that looked, as he describes them, like \"micron layers of lincoln logs, orthogonal to one another, and joined where they touch.\" to joannopoulos' delight, the spaces between the bars interacted with laser light in just the way he predicted.still, this was merely a proof of concept. the designs joannopoulos began to envision were much more ambitious, even propelling the theorist into the trenches with the engineers. \"it's been fun,\" he says, \"obtaining patents and pretending we're inventors.\"his first idea was to create flaws in a band-gap crystal, \"to make the photons do what we want them to do.\" because the regular pattern is what gives the crystal its power to turn away gate-crashing photons, interrupting the pattern is like opening a window in a wall - it provides the photons with a soft spot where they can enter. \"suppose,\" says joannopoulos, \"you are a photon. you enter through a defect in the crystal. you look around and see a perfect crystalline environment. you cannot penetrate it because you have a forbidden wavelength. so you follow the defect, no matter how it twists and turns. you must! you have no choice!\" he pauses, momentarily embarrassed. \"i really do think about particles in an anthropomorphic fashion.\"joannopoulos first described this redirection of photons in a landmark paper published in 1997 in nature. he and his mit coauthors, pierre villeneuve and shanhui fan, proposed that the principle be used to build the world's most perfect waveguide, a fundamental device in optics. then they drew up a plan for a structure containing a more complicated defect, one that would persuade some frequencies of light to split away from others. a device that can do this with laser light - a channel add/drop filter for wave division multiplexing - already exists, but it's not easy to work with.\"one of these filters is normally about this size,\" says joannopoulos, cupping his hands together to illustrate. he turns to a printed document on his desk and points to a period in the text: \"we can make one smaller than this dot. now, we're not going to go out and fabricate this tomorrow, but we have a design, and it's possible.\"actually, such a device could be on the market sooner than joannopoulos suggests. villeneuve left mit last year to start clarendon photonics, where he's reportedly working on a channel add/drop filter. though he refuses to confirm the exact nature of his work - \"we could be blown out of the water,\" villeneuve says, \"if the giants get wind of what we're doing\" - he does co-own the relevant intellectual property, which he helped develop during his five and a half years at mit.since his waveguide work, joannopoulos has been collaborating with leslie kolodziejski at mit's department of electrical engineering and computer science. kolodziejski is the one who tells the theoretical physicist what's feasible, then has the challenge of trying to build the components. \"typically,\" she says, \"we brainstorm about an idea and get everyone's input to figure out how the problem can be solved. john and his group do some trial simulations, together we get some dimensions and structure down, and my group will start to fabricate the different parts of the device.\"in the lab, cradling her 4-week-old daughter against her shoulder as she sidesteps racks of monitoring equipment and passes beneath cables as thick as jungle vines, kolodziejski makes her way to a mysterious object, a stack of spherical chambers sprouting cylindrical turrets. the whole thing looks as if it were machined from a huge block of gleaming steel. with its circular portholes, it resembles a baroque undersea exploration vehicle.the shiny object beside her is refrigerated and has had almost all the air extracted from it, resulting in an ultrahigh vacuum, so that the tiniest objects can be manipulated without interference from random molecules. in one sense, the nautical look is appropriate: on a microscopic scale, kolodziejski is doing something very similar to building a ship in a bottle. \"i came to mit in 1988,\" she explains, raising her voice above the roar of the refrigeration system. \"i wanted to do new things in epitaxial deposition, which means depositing individual layers of atoms. we can place one atom at a time, just about.\"mit's main building looks like a castle. it has massive stone walls, gigantic staircases, and a lobby with 50-foot stone columns and a great domed roof. but the modern structures behind it have a relentlessly utilitarian appearance. with vinyl floors and painted cinder-block walls, these new buildings clearly serve one function: they're a place to further science.inside this complex, ned thomas, a professor of materials science and engineering, and yoel fink, a postdoctoral associate, are developing a different form of band-gap device that - while not quite serving the purposes joannopoulos envisions - avoids the manufacturing challenges kolodziejski faces. instead of structural subtraction or addition, thomas and fink are exploring self-assembly.to illustrate the process, they lay out samples of plastic film on a table. although the film appears to be transparent, it reflects light as if it were coated with oil, forming rainbow patterns in a strange and beautiful way. \"suppose you take some polyethylene and polystyrene,\" says thomas, referring to the polymers commonly used to make garbage bags and styrofoam cups, respectively. \"you can mix them with a solvent. but the molecules don't really like each other, so they repel one another when the solvent is removed.\"a polymer sticks most easily to its own type, but chemists have found a way to force the unlike molecules to self-assemble in pairs. this creates a regular pattern that can interfere with light the way a band-gap crystal does, allowing some wavelengths to pass through while reflecting others with almost 100 percent efficiency. the phenomenon isn't new - it even occurs in nature. the lustrous hues in natural pearls are a band-gap effect, caused by layers that self-assemble as a pearl grows inside an oyster shell. the patterns on the morpho butterfly's wings also self-assemble in response to genetic code.thomas and fink have been greatly amused by thinking of applications for self-assembled band-gap films. some will work beyond the visible spectrum - on infrared, for instance. fink talks about coating windows as a way to keep heat out while letting light in, thus reducing the need for summertime air-conditioning. thomas suggests that a similar film could be painted on satellites to protect them from laser weapons.fink has even found some band-gap polymer combinations that are edible. \"my idea was to create colored food without using dyes,\" he says. \"you could have benign colorants - with very high control over color quality.\" since he made this suggestion publicly, representatives from the mars candy company have been in contact with mit, although nobody will say precisely what the \"men from mars\" have in mind. maybe we'll see some photonic sweets sometime in the next year or so - perhaps around halloween.\"clothes are another possibility,\" says fink.__the dream began with cool-running computers. now researchers envision photonic clothing, cell phone shielding, even candy bars. __\"that's right,\" thomas agrees. \"we don't have to think about just doing nerdy things. we can create colors that can be more interesting and long-lasting. all red dyes tend to fade, you know, unless you create the red by interference.\"commercial enterprises are already exploring many of these ideas. at time domain, a privately held company in huntsville, alabama, research physicist michael scalora suggests that band-gap films be used for sunglasses or safety goggles. since the band-gap effect can work with frequencies beyond the visible range, a protective film on your video screen would allow you a completely clear view of the text and graphics that wouldn't expose you to electromagnetic radiation. another kind of film could be added to the glass door of a microwave oven, replacing the fine-metal mesh used now. this film would let you see your food cooking but would protect your eyes from being cooked. scalora notes that his company is also engaged in \"ongoing collaborative efforts with the quantum optics group at the us army aviation and missile command, redstone arsenal, and the university of rome.\"meanwhile, eli yablonovitch has his own plans for self-assembled polymer films. \"the walls around you are painted a shade of white,\" he says. \"and when you print a document, you print it on white paper. in paint or in paper, they use titanium dioxide to make it white. that's what you're paying for. self-assembly methods are going to be so cheap, you'll be able to replace much of the white pigment with an array of holes.\"this bizarre-sounding concept would work on the same principle as the wing of a morpho butterfly - except the microscopic pattern would reflect all the wavelengths in white light instead of just the ones in the blue range. the reflection could be so efficient that the whiteness would exceed anything available today.self-assembly has a big disadvantage, though: since the crystal formation happens spontaneously, there's no way to eliminate tiny atomic defects. this may not matter with a piece of paper or a pair of sunglasses, but if it's going to process streams of data in telecommunications, a photonic crystal needs to be built with precise control at the atomic level.at bell labs, pierre wiltzius has developed a mode of self-assembly that he hopes will produce sufficiently error-free crystals. first he inserts microscopic particles into a fluid, forming a colloidal suspension. then he removes the fluid, allowing the particles to settle. \"they assemble themselves like a stack of oranges,\" wiltzius explains, \"with empty space between them, about one-quarter of the total volume. this process is very nice - you don't need complex machinery or tools.\"to process data, wiltzius still needs to create channels to guide the photons. \"that's where we are right now,\" he says: \"figuring out how to do that.\"at nec's research institute, david norris, another self-assembly pioneer, is studying the possibility of using metals. \"we're making pretty good progress with metals like silver,\" he says. \"but no one knows yet whether it will be good enough - that is, without defects.\"if the scale of the structure is increased, the defects become trivial by comparison. since a band-gap crystal can be scaled to work with any kind of wave, yablonovitch says we can enlarge the crystal structure to match the wavelengths used in radio communications.\"some people are afraid that radio waves from cell phones are harmful to the head. your head does absorb radio waves, but this is dangerous only to the efficiency of the cell phone,\" he deadpans. \"if you put a reflective shield between the phone and your head, the cell phone antenna could be much more efficient.\"the reflector yablonovitch has in mind would, he insists, offer three benefits: your head would stop degrading the cell phone signal, everyone would be relieved to know that their brains really are protected from radiation (which is hard for many to believe today, in spite of yablonovitch's cheerful assurances), and cell phones would be either more powerful or able to maintain the same range with smaller batteries. yablonovitch has already started a company, the photonic rf corporation, to develop his antenna idea.at rockwell international's science center in thousand oaks, california, the big-time defense contractor is pursuing similar band-gap research. rockwell physicist aiden higgins has developed band-gap crystals that work with frequencies in military communications. \"this is an r&d lab,\" he cautions. \"our product is just proof of concept right now. but we have proved quite a few concepts at this point, and i think you will see the first examples in two or three years.\"if the crystalline structure is scaled up even more, the band gap eventually reaches the point where it interacts with sound waves, which also turns out to have a military application. in 1999, darpa invited small companies to develop a way to use the band-gap effect to suppress the noise of military vehicles. aerotech engineering & research corporation in lawrence, kansas, won one of the contracts. \"a vehicle has a distinct noise signature,\" explains aerotech executive vp kyle wetzel. \"a general noise-damper tends to reduce the noise at all frequencies, but the signature is still there. what we have developed is a narrow-band filter that alters the signature.\"originally, aerotech experimented with aluminum rods. \"but now we have an inch-thick plate of epoxy that contains an intricate pattern of voids and tubes to tune the frequency. the tubes are about 1 millimeter in diameter, connected to chambers about a quarter of an inch in diameter.\"aerotech sees commercial applications that go far beyond the original darpa specs. \"we are lining up four or five partners,\" says wetzel, \"and some of the possibilities involve home entertainment.\" for example, acoustic band-gap materials will allow for speakers that are precisely tuned, amplifying some frequencies while blocking others.since large, regular structures have the potential to block sound waves, why haven't we already noticed them doing this all around us? one reason is that, in nature and in architecture, few crystalline structures exist in such huge proportions. but, occasionally, an everyday object can turn out to have band-gap properties.__the lab rats can barely contain their excitement at what they've got already. imagine when mass-scale commercial self-assembly kicks in. __artist eusebio sempere created an abstract street sculpture in madrid by standing steel rods vertically at regular intervals. acting on a hunch, scientists from the universidad polit\u00e9cnica de valencia tested the sculpture and found that it reflects some sound frequencies - partially, at least - and allows others to pass freely.at mit, ned thomas and yoel fink suggest that the same principle could be used to create sound barriers beside highways. the barriers could be tuned to block highway noise, while holes or spaces in the structure would allow birdsong to waft through. of course, perforated barriers would also use fewer raw materials and admit more air and sunlight. on an even larger scale, thomas and fink think a regular pattern of massive concrete columns could reflect ocean waves and reduce beach erosion, while allowing tides to ebb and flow.and that's not the limit for macro-effects. theoretical physicist mihail sigalas, currently designing band-gap crystals for telecommunications at agilent, remains interested in other possibilities. theoretically, he says, the band-gap effect could be scaled to block the seismic waves of an earthquake. \"those wavelengths are so large you would need very big structures, such as holes 10 meters wide, deep in the earth. it would be very challenging. but you could certainly do it in theory. it has been demonstrated on a small scale, with 1-centimeter holes in a piece of rock.\"while many commercial applications are still entirely speculative, one thing is certain: the telecommunications industry promises the biggest initial payback. some manufacturers have already begun to apply band-gap principles to optical fibers. at corning, research associate douglas allan explains that, in a conventional solid fiber, \"multiple pulses of light can interfere with one another indirectly. when one photon comes along, it slightly modifies how the glass affects the next photon, and when the intensity of the light increases, the problem increases.\"so he proposes using a glass strand with a hollow core. some smaller hollow tubes are arrayed around this core to make the strand behave like a very long, thin band-gap crystal. the core channels the gate-crasher wavelengths, which can't escape into the rest of the strand. allan estimates that possibly more than 100 times as many signals could be transmitted simultaneously - at greater intensities and with lower losses - through such a hollow fiber. but he cautions that the new fiber must be tough enough to be handled in the field and flexible enough to interface with existing equipment. these are big demands.fink believes he has an even better way to meet them. he and some colleagues have raised $4 million to start a new company, omniguide communications. like allan, fink proposes a fiber with a hollow core and arrayed strands, but with each strand built from multiple concentric layers, like the rings in a tree trunk. he claims that signal losses would be so negligible that there'd be almost no need for the amplifiers positioned every 60 miles or so along conventional optical fibers to boost laser light dimmed by passing through solid glass. \"each amplifier costs up to $50,000 for land use and $250,000 for use in the ocean,\" fink notes. \"plus, there's maintenance costs and power consumption.\"eliminating these costs will be a minor achievement compared with the performance boost. fink calculates that his hollow-core design can transmit about 1,000 times as much data per second as regular fiber can. is he planning to license the technology to fiber-manufacturing companies? \"no,\" he says, \"we actually plan to manufacture these fibers. i want to put corning and lucent out of business.\"when it comes to the routing equipment used with fiber, experts aren't convinced that photonic band-gap devices can replace all the electronics. so far, band-gap crystals are suitable only for relatively simple, specialized components such as waveguides and filters. even yablonovitch, who was originally motivated by the dream of a 100 percent optical computer, is ready to compromise. he feels photonic crystals should be used in conjunction with mems arrays of tiny, movable mirrors, since they're already up and running.but bell labs' pierre wiltzius is uncompromising. \"today,\" he says, \"we do beautiful things with mirrors, but the dimensions are comparatively large. this is the big promise of photonic crystals: to integrate functionality in a much smaller space.\"john joannopoulos hasn't given up on the idea of solid-state optical computing. the first step will be to develop the most fundamental component: a switch. since photons don't interact with one another, it's difficult to see how one light beam can switch another one on and off, but joannopoulos has some ideas for working around that. \"we could use a crystal whose dielectric function depends on the intensity of the light that's present,\" he says.in this scenario, a beam of light is pointed at a piece of photosensitive material - whose band gaps are consequently shifted - in order to switch another beam of light on or off. a priority at mit right now is to develop this concept. \"we haven't fabricated a switch,\" cautions leslie kolodziejski. \"but we are talking about the materials we need and the problems of building it. we are planning for it.\"joannopoulos' irrepressible optimism makes it hard for him to echo such caution. \"hype can cause difficulties,\" he says, acknowledging the damage done back in the '80s at bell labs. \"but, look, this field doesn't need hype. one has to be a fool not to realize something great is going to come out of this. we professors - we need to resign from our positions if we don't come up with something.\"what i am trying to get across,\" he continues, \"is our excitement about what we've got already. what we have now is so impressive, i don't need to speculate about the future.\"as always, the person who wrestles with the physical limitations of materials on a daily basis tends to be most circumspect. \"fabrication is prone to error,\" kolodziejski notes. \"always. and this is a real problem, since the band-gap phenomenon depends on absolute precision. another challenge is designing devices that can work with a wide range of wavelengths - and we have to integrate sources of light with the devices that detect light and route light. we need to do all that.\"plausible? \"it's plausible. we wouldn't be putting in all this effort if we didn't think so. perhaps within three years - or four,\" she adds, just to be on the safe side.yablonovitch has seen photonic band-gap crystals come further than anyone would have expected. when asked whether they'll reach the same level of importance that semiconductors have, he pauses to consider the possibility. his answer is simple: \"yes.\""}
