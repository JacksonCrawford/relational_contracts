myplay's locker is bottomless.... yahoo jumps on the riaa bandwagon.... and getmusic goes multimedia as brad king spins this week's digital music news.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "09.09.2000 03:00 AM", "text": "\"warning. current u.s. and international copyright laws forbid the unauthorized copying and distribution of music files over the internet. don't be the example chosen by some record company or recording artist to show the rest of the world that the law really works.\" seems reasonable, until you consider where those words came from and who recited them.those are the words of wisdom proffered by mp3.com (mppp) ceo michael robertson in his 1999 book, the official mp3.com guide to mp3.when u.s. district judge jed rakoff issued his written ruling that robertson's company had willfully engaged in copyright infringement with the creation of its my.mp3.com service, that quote was the first fact he referenced to support his decision.doh!indeed, rakoff followed robertson's quote with references to several internal emails from engineers and managers who continually raised the question as to whether the database mp3.com created was legal \u2013- which was the crux of evidence cited by the judge in the case.it's not the first time a judge has gone after a prominent digital music company using the words of its leader. when u.s. district judge marilyn patel issued her napster ruling, she cited several internal emails from co-founders shawn fanning and sean parker that anticipated the complete collapse of the recording industry under the weight of file trading.what was disappointing in this case \u2013- at least from the perspective of digital music companies \u2013- was not getting a chance to have the favor returned by edgar bronfman jr., head honcho at seagram, whose company was among those suing mp3.com.robertson's main defense was that moving early in the digital music space was the only way mp3.com could compete with the recording industry, which has been slow to license its content.as the mp3.com lawyers began questioning universal music group's competitive tactics, rakoff shut down that defense, ruling it was irrelevant to whether robertson's company had willfully committed infringement.that, of course, left some rather tasty issues unanswered at the trial:of course, mp3.com still has a lot of fight left in it and robertson will probably go out of his way to raise more questions along these lines \u2013- whether they get answered or not.myplay's digital play: not everyone would be unhappy to see mp3.com go under, though. long in the shadow of robertson's company, digital-locker service myplay.com is hoping its new wireless play will boost its notoriety.the company's \"myplay-to-go\" entertainment platform will allow telecommunications and consumer hardware and software manufacturers to work with myplay.com's virtual locker. about 2.5 million users store their music in the locker.\"the future of digital music lies beyond the pc,\" myplay.com ceo doug camplejohn said in a statement. \"soon, you'll be able to access your music collection via your mobile phone, your car, your tv set, or a number of portable devices. myplay-to-go is a key step in fulfilling our company vision of letting you access your music from anywhere you happen to be.\"---riaa to webcasters -- yahoo: portal giant yahoo (yhoo) came to terms with the recording industry association of america on rates for its webcasting license, marking another victory for the recording industry.since october 1998, internet broadcasters have had access to digital music through the statutory license provided under the digital millennium copyright act, although the royalty payments were not specified.so far, only a handful of small companies such as www.com and soundbreak.com have staked out a claim to licenses with the riaa, as most are waiting for the united states copyright office to determine what rates must be paid to artists, labels, and publishers.yahoo is jumping the gun, hoping its strategy will pay off in the long run when companies rush to obtain the newly minted rates of the statutory license, which is expected to be finalized sometime before the end of the year.---got video?: since mtv doesn't much play videos anymore -\u2013 and who really has access to mtv2 -\u2013 getmusic created videolab, where users can create their own videos.starting with songs from everclear, hanson, and sonic youth, users can choose from 15 visual shots or upload their own work that can all be edited together. after the video is assembled, the video auteur then mixes the beats to synch up with the video.finished works can be submitted to videolab for \"best video\" consideration. the only downside: the winner receives sony's own portable music player."}
