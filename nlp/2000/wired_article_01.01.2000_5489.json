every year chips get tinier, cheaper, and faster.if proponents are correct, mems will soon be ubiquitous. there will be the far out (airborne micro flying machines, networked minibots) and the practical (disposable blood-pressure gauges, wearable pollution sensors). within 20 years, there will be no avoiding mems: they will be in every telecom line, computer, and coffeemaker - even in our own bodies. as these sensors and actuators - devices that react to their environment - permeate the world, the fabric of daily existence will come alive.like the transistor and the microprocessor, mems are often described as a disruptive technology, as in change-the-world, turn-it-upside-down, rewrite-the-rules-of-the-game. forget about the kind of incremental change that fits easily into business plans. mems advocates say we need to prepare for a wholesale overhaul.the underlying technology is here, now, seeking funding and ready for deployment. hundreds of companies and thousands of researchers around the globe are working on mems projects. here's a look at five standouts, ranging from the fanciful to the front-and-center. get ready to be disrupted.moresome of the micromachines constructed at sandia national laboratories - a government research facility in albuquerque, new mexico - look like the work of an eccentric 19th-century tinkerer. a wealth of rotating gears with hubs ratchet together in delightful complexity - reminiscent of the innards of an antique swiss timepiece.one possible application for such a complex gadget is in a lock for nuclear bombs that guards against accidental detonation. but even more impressive than the machines themselves is the pioneering process behind the technology.mems are usually created through techniques that result in two or three layers of structural material. sandia, however, has patented a five-layer process, and the more layers, the more the potential complexity. federally funded to the tune of $100 million a year, sandia's microsystems center employs this method to manufacture thousands of prototype mems for academic and corporate researchers every year, says paul mcwhorter, the center's deputy director.even so, the lab is not equipped to handle mass production. the lack of any large-scale mems foundries, many entrepreneurs complain, is one of the factors holding the technology back. it's a classic catch-22: since there isn't yet enough market demand for mems devices, they can't be manufactured in numbers high enough to bring the price of mems chips down to the point where they make economic sense.that problem, says mcwhorter, is about to be solved. early next year, sandia will announce an agreement with a major corporation to create a commercial foundry that will license sandia's five-layer technology. then, says mcwhorter, \"you are going to see the logjam really break. a major manufacturing facility will be able to produce these devices in large numbers.\"if the bothell, washington-based microvision has its way, within the next several years, you won't be watching videos on a television screen, a computer monitor, or even the latest color plasma display. instead, you'll don mems-enhanced eyeglasses to beam full-color, full-motion images directly onto your retina.microvision's high-resolution virtual retina displays are being developed for use in military aircraft, flight simulators, wearable computers, and gaming systems. embedded into an eyeglasses frame is a mems chip with a moving, pinhead-sized mirror that reflects a harmless, low-power laser beam.\"you need to scan laser beams into the eyes of a user,\" says thor osborn, the engineer in charge of microvision's mems research. \"to do that in a lightweight format, mems is the natural choice - the silicon itself weighs less than a gram.\"the us air force, army, and navy are already using helmet-mounted prototypes for a virtual cockpit-training program and a portable navigation system. current versions project only red monochrome images into each eye. next, the company plans to elegantly integrate the chip into an ordinary glasses frame.successful commercial development depends on advances in computer processing power and wireless bandwidth connectivity. but with the basic mems technology proven, microvision says its immersive full-color specs are coming into focus.microsensors, a mems startup based in costa mesa, california, has trained chips to figure out where they are in relation to the physical world. similar sensors - accelerometers that react to abrupt changes in speed, such as when your car hits a tree - are already standard in air bags. microsensors is working on \"angular rate sensors\" that provide considerably more information, like how sharply your car is turning.its mems are built around micro gyros: rotating wheels that can sense oscillations. gyros-on-a-chip are being investigated for military applications such as in-flight, real-time guidance for, say, a howitzer shell. game controllers, virtual reality devices, and video cameras are other obvious markets.prototype chips are being manufactured at one-tenth the cost of non-mems gyros, says the company, and will soon be ubiquitous.take your basic mems sensor, add a few articulated legs and the ability to communicate via lasers, and you've got the makings of a microbot. this autonomous critter can navigate complex terrain and communicate with its brethren.more than most mems applications, microbots seize the popular imagination. at the uc berkeley sensor and actuator center, professor kris pister and grad student richard yeh have already manufactured a microbot exoskeleton - a silicon slab 5 millimeters wide that sports six hinged legs and an array of sensors.yeh sees clear uses for the lilliputian bots. an army of these mobile sensor units could gather data from areas inaccessible to humans, such as post-earthquake rubble or a war-torn battleground.pister and yeh chose to mimic bugs because of the insect world's awesomely efficient physics. as yeh puts it, \"nature has already thought of the most optimal body and mechanisms for a robot.\"the project still has a long way to go. pister and yeh have completed the exoskeleton, but they're working on the all-important actuators, the mems chips that will enable the hinged legs to move. there are also niggling problems such as developing an appropriate power source. but in the not-too-distant future, you may want to look twice before you swat that bug crawling up your leg.\"fiber-optic mems switches will be the first billion-dollar mems telecom application,\" says david bishop, head of micromechanics research at lucent's bell labs. according to bishop, these switches, perhaps just a few years away, will uncork the internet's bandwidth bottleneck and set traffic roaring at light speed.current routing technology - which slows the bit flow by transforming optical signals into electronic information and then back into light before redirecting it - can't keep up with the amount of data that can travel through a fiber-optic pipe. \"we're already putting 3 terabits through fiber,\" says bishop. \"if you have hundreds of fibers coming in, what gizmo can you build that lets you handle thousands of terabits?\"the answer is a mems switch - little more than a chip with a movable microscopic mirror that can redirect beams of light nearly instantaneously without having to do translation. bishop says advances in semiconductor fabrication processes have reached the point where mass-manufacturing such devices is now practical. mems switches, promises bishop, will not only significantly increase the net's overall throughput but will save money.\"a typical optic switch might cost a thousand dollars,\" says bishop, \"but using mems, you can achieve that same functionality for 10 cents. five years from now, the winner will be the one that got mems out fastest, and the losers will be the ones that didn't.\"the mems revolutionintroductionmems megafoundryhi-res retina displaysmicro-gyro sensorsmicrobotsterabit fiber-optic switches"}
