challenge microsoft's windows operating system. by leander kahney.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "science", "type": "article", "timestamp": "08.15.2000 03:00 AM", "text": "some big names in the computer industry are teaming up to help create a free, easy-to-use operating system to rival microsoft's windows. sun microsystems, ibm, and compaq have joined with red hat, the free software foundation, and va linux, among others, to form the gnome foundation, a coalition to develop and promote the gnome desktop environment.at the linuxworld expo in san jose, california, on tuesday, the foundation announced that it will establish gnome as a common desktop environment for gnu/linux and other unix operating systems.the gnome project also formed an advisory board for the foundation with members from compaq, hewlett-packard, ibm, red hat, sun microsystems, eazel, the free software foundatio, turbolinux and va linux.the move is another step toward establishing gnu/linux as a viable alternative to windows and the mac os, and goes some way toward reuniting the numerous, incompatible flavors of unix on the market.while gnu/linux is popular in the world of servers, its lack of a nice, friendly interface is one of the major reasons it hasn't taken off with joe sixpack -- despite the fact that it's free to download, install, copy, and redistribute.the 3-year-old gnome project had planned to change that by developing a framework and an all-important suite of software libraries developers need to create software applications, the life blood of any operating system.but miguel de icaza, gnome's chief coordinator and the chief technology officer for helixcode, said the ad hoc nature of the project, which is made up of about 400 volunteer programmers, scared off a lot of big companies.\"so far the gnome project has been managed by me and my friends,\" he said. \"but it's really hard to keep track of everything. the gnome foundation will provide a central point of contact for everybody.... the foundation gets everyone working together on one unified standard for one unified desktop.\"de icaza said the foundation, which consists of more than a dozen free software developers and leading hardware vendors, will coordinate gnome's technical development and provide legal and financial support to the project.the foundation also makes it easier for competing companies to work together to develop the gnome technology, he said. in the absence of a formal entity like the gnome foundation, antitrust regulators might view collaboration between ibm and sun as illegal market fixing, de icaza said.\"i think we're going to come up with something mind-blowing that will offer a very good alternative to proprietary operating systems (like windows and the mac os),\" he added.marco boerries, sun's vice president and general manager of webtop and application software, said the initiative in some respects reverses the '70s famous splitting of unix into numerous, incompatible versions.the foundation \"is a very credible attempt to bring it back together, at least at the desktop level,\" he said.boerries said sun will contribute technology that improves gnome's quality and reliability, and code that improves access for non-english speaking users and those with disabilities.the foundation will also integrate gnome with sun's openoffice.org initiative, which includes a set of open-file formats and apis for productivity applications, as well as sun's staroffice suite. the marriage will provide gnu/linux with not only an easy-to-use desktop, but a set of open productivity applications to rival microsoft's critically important office suite, boerries said.boerries said sun will be adopting gnome as the default user environment for solaris, the company's version of unix.another member of the foundation, eazel, is working on nautilus, an easy-to-use file management system, which will make its first public appearance at the linuxworld show.gnome will use the mozilla web browser and a software installer and tools for setting up the system from de icaza's helixcode.stacey quandt, an analyst with giga information group, said she was encouraged by the roster of big names backing the project, but said gnome may have a tough time taking on microsoft, which is entrenched in the pc market.she did say, however, that gnome may fare better with new internet-access devices -- from handhelds and smartphones to web tablets and email appliances.\"right now microsoft dominates the desktop,\" she said. \"but gnome could be the desktop for different form factors.... this fits very much with sun's strategy of making applications available over the internet. and sun's strategy is very much real, while microsoft's net strategy looks very much like vaporware at the moment.\"quandt said gnome is already getting off the ground. she noted that compaq will be showing its new ipaq handheld running gnome at the show, and that ibm will offer gnome as an option with its popular line of thinkpad notebooks.\"the implications for microsoft are tremendous,\" she said. \"i think it will be a serious threat to microsoft.\""}
