next beer-tinged revelry. not so jon johansen. the norwegian teen hacker may testify thursday in a landmark trial over the dvd-descrambling program he wrote, which hollywood hopes to ban from the internet.in the half-year or so since he published decss on his website, johansen has become the closest thing the linux and hacking communities have to a teen idol.protesters outside the courthouse this week waved huge, almost eerie, placards with his face on them while chanting open-source software slogans at passersby. hackers in town for a convention pointed at johansen from afar with palpable awe, even reverence.what cemented his status as a cause c\u00e9l&egravebre was hollywood's harsh reaction to the publication of the decss decryption utility. in january, officials from norway's department of economic crime hauled johansen to a local police station for questions related to the u.s. lawsuit brought by eight movie studios.the lad was never imprisoned, but the idea of a programmer being interrogated -- and having his computers seized -- for what amounts to a clever hack seemed to symbolize, to many in the community, corporate arrogance gone too far. at linuxworld 2000, johansen fans passed out bumper stickers that read \"free jon johansen.\"attorneys for the entertainment industry don't seem to appreciate the idea of johansen as a countercultural poster boy.during a private conversation with u.s. district judge lewis kaplan on tuesday, charles sims of the law firm proskauer rose objected to johansen taking the witness stand. \"i think he shouldn't be allowed to testify as a witness. i think this is improper game play,\" sims said during the sidebar, according to a transcript.sims said that if johansen wanted to testify, he should do so next week so that proskauer rose attorneys would have time to perform a deposition.\"he came here to support your cause, and at a convention he's making speeches with his father for a week. if he wants to support your cause, let him stay until monday,\" sims said.ernest hernstadt, an attorney representing 2600 magazine, said that johansen was scheduled to leave late thursday. \"he's not in our control. this is a 16- or 17-year-old kid. he's here with his dad,\" hernstadt said.\"he's going to say that he did decss, he and two other people did decss in order to help the linux dvd player. and he's going to say that he didn't hate linux and he doesn't have any problems with linux,\" hernstadt said.kaplan sided with the defense. \"i will hear him, if he's here and he wants to testify on thursday, out of order, provided he's made available ... to the plaintiffs for a deposition,\" he ruled.earlier in the day, the motion picture industry tried to depict johansen as a foe of the open-source linux operating system.the move was designed to show that if linux users truly wanted to play dvds on their systems, decss would not have been a windows utility. in the suit, the plaintiffs have argued that decss allows widespread piracy of dvds.robert schumann, president of a consulting company that has as its biggest client the motion picture association of america, took the witness stand tuesday and pointed to messages he found in the archives of a linux-dvd mailing list.\"this is a posting by jon johansen and what he describes here is that he has released (decss and) provides the location to go ... click to get that executable,\" schumann said. \"and also you'll note in the middle two sentences that he specifically says it works on (windows). note that there is no reference to linux and any other operating system other than the windows operating systems.\"schumann also suggested that johansen doesn't really like linux much at all.\"this message was written by jon johansen, again, in reply to one of the members of the dvd group,\" schumann said. \"apparently, jon johansen has told this member that he doesn't like linux. ... he really prefers freebsd, which is another open source unique environment and there appears to have been an angry exchange between these two about the merits of their respective operating systems.\"johansen later told wired news that he has a linux setup at home and thought the industry's allegations were ridiculous. he also said that the norwegian police still have the computers they seized from him, though they did return his cellphone charger.the defense lawyers responded to the charge with their own witness, cryptographer frank stevenson.\"it is my understanding that at the time the decss, the windows program, was released, the linux operating system did not have the capabilities to read the udf file system that is used on the dvd disks themselves,\" stevenson testified. \"so for this reason if you want to play a dvd you would have to do the decryption under an operating system that did support the udf file system, and windows is one such file system.\"in january, eight movie studios, including disney and warner brothers, sued 2600 magazine for distributing decss on its website.kaplan granted the plaintiffs a preliminary injunction against the magazine. the electronic frontier foundation is paying 2600's legal fees.johansen, who says he occasionally uses the handle \"mnx,\" is a member of masters of reverse engineering, the group that released the decss utility last year. other programs appear to have used the decss routines, but the more version added a graphical user interface.his father, per johansen, said his son plans to study computer science at a university in france."}
