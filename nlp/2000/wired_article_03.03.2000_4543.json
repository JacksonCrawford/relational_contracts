web competition starts to heat up: patent wars. by chris oakes.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "security", "type": "article", "timestamp": "03.03.2000 03:00 AM", "text": "many silicon valley companies are deciding that when it comes to technology patents, the best defense is a good offense. in the high-technology age, the patent has become more than a way to protect legitimate intellectual property. it's often the legal equivalent of a cold war nuclear stockpile: sue me over your patents and i'll sue you over mine.\"it's what i like to disparagingly refer to as 'mutually assured crap,'\" said greg aharonian, a patent researcher and an oft-quoted critic of the u.s. patent and trademark office. \"it's like the cold war strategy of mutually assured destruction.\"amazon came under fire this week for winning what critics charge is another patent for a web technology that is too fundamental to be owned by any company.internet- and web-related patents often are approved by a patent office that has admitted that it is overloaded and under-resourced.amazon.com has already sued competitor barnesandnoble.com over another of its web patents, which resulted in a web community-organized boycott against amazon.\"internet-involved enterprises of all types continue building their own patent portfolios, for both offensive and defensive purposes,\" said intellectual property attorney alan fisch.but given the current state of patent law -- and the patent office -- it's a sound business strategy, said patent attorney virginia medlen. \"it's a gray area. if you're not well-prepared you could end up falling into the pit.\"the pit isn't pretty.medlen cited a case her firm is representing for a wisconsin biotech company. the patent-infringement suit was filed in 1993 and has yet to go to court.\"we're talking millions of dollars down the drain -- nonproductive money being spent on lawyers. it's a very ugly situation,\" medlen said.as a weapon against competitors, a patent can be a potent offense.\"if you have a patent and approach someone else, you can get an injunction [and] cause a lot of harm up front,\" aharonian said.as a result, there's little incentive for companies not to patent everything they can.\"people will throw something into the patent office just to see if they can get something issued,\" medlen said. \"once it's issued, under law the presumption is that it's valid. and to knock it down the challenger has to produce clear and convincing evidence that the patent is not valid, and that clear and convincing evidence is very difficult to prove.\"that's where the defensive counter-patent comes in.a judge faced with two similar, but competing patents is likely to tell the opponents to settle the issue themselves, rather than try to wade through the subtle differences in court.\"[the counter-patent] is a relatively inexpensive way to present evidence of invalidity,\" medlen said.internet companies certainly seem to be in the know about the strategy.speaking wednesday at the robertson stephens tech 2000 conference, infospace ceo naveen jain detailed his own company's defensive approach to patenting.\"we have a patent on co-branded e-commerce. we are not people who try to enforce our patents. all we want to do is make sure no one tries to come after us,\" jain said.software giant microsoft is also among those who have claimed defensive reasons for their patent filings. web developers were up in arms a year ago when microsoft was awarded a patent that could give the company control over important open standards used in the construction of web sites, called stylesheets.but the company said it wasn't looking for money, but defense against others that might seek to wrest control over open web standards.indeed, prior to the patent award, microsoft itself had been sued over what appeared to be another fundamental web function: adding features to web browsers via plug-ins.among the so-called bogus patents are many legitimate ones -- only courts can decide for sure -- but it's all part of a more benign approach in an ugly patent game.one industry source said the practice is so common that some big-name companies chock full of communications technology patents have struck agreements not to sue each other.their other competitors may not be so lucky.fixing the problem, most agree, starts at the patent office. the office needs better-paid, better-educated technology examiners, critics say. but technology experts and engineers come at a cost in this booming, stock-option-rich net economy.aharonian thinks that adding $1,000 to the processing cost of each patent application would be enough to fund the office into shape.\"companies are already spending 10 to 20 grand to file applications,\" he said. \"for 5 to 10 percent more you'd get rid of most of these problems.\"but getting that money reallocated is difficult, aharonian said.\"congress has been raiding patent office money instead of giving them money,\" he said."}
