napster can be shut down because it is a company and requires dedicated servers.\"\"gnutella is open source and does not require any servers, it cannot be stopped without placing individual writs on the entire internet community around the world.\"a spokeswoman for electronic frontier foundation, which has championed free trading of music, said the group would not comment on the decision until it was clear whether a stay would be granted."}
