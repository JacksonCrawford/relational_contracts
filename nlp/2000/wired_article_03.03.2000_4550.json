telecommunications in mexico is violating international trade agreements by not forcing telmex, the country's largest phone company, to allow competition.", "author": "wired staff", "category":

found out who calls the shots there -- telephone group telmex. patagon.com technology director ian zagury said that lines have taken weeks to install. data services and line rentals that cost less than $100 a month in the united states cost thousands of dollars a month here and only telmex can set up connections, even though patagon.com has relationships with other data service providers. when new york-based derivatives brokerage gfi group wanted to set up direct, always-on phone lines to shout prices back and forth with mexico city brokerages, it could not get them.\"in a nutshell, the last mile is controlled by telmex and telmex makes it very difficult for any other vendors. we've been trying for years to get circuits to mexico city,\" said sean gormley, senior vice president of gfi group.these are just two of the frustrated firms that include banks, multinational corporations, and internet companies that need broadband telecommunications -- high-speed lines to move large amounts of data around mexico and abroad.competitors, consumers, and analysts accuse telefonos de mexico of blocking competition by dragging its feet or refusing to make connections data service providers need to link clients to their own fiber optic rings.the controversy has spilled over the border. u.s.-based competitors have complained to american authorities, saying mexican regulator cofetel violates international trade commitments by failing to force telmex to allow competition.even big competitors, such as mexican long-distance companies alestra, 49 percent owned by at&t, and avantel, 45 percent held by mci worldcom -- depend on telmex's enormous network.telmex, which declined to comment on the controversy, is the flagship of the expanding international business empire of mexican billionaire carlos slim, latin america's richest man, with an estimated personal wealth of $12.5 billion.slim's companies, ranging from copper to coffee shops, have a combined market capitalization of over $60 billion and account for nearly one-half of mexico's stock index.telmex, the largest publicly traded company in latin america, is mexico's dominant local, long-distance and cellular operator and the biggest internet service provider, with 58 percent of the paid internet accounts in mexico.competitors that offer data transmission services say they want to rent lines from telmex rather than install high-capacity links, a huge investment that duplicates telmex's network.but five companies -- competitors and consumers -- said that renting lines is difficult or impossible because telmex is more inclined to provide lines for clients that use its data services.\"it's a very unhealthy situation where only one company is offering services ... . it makes it very difficult for (them) to get or retain customers for broadband, high-speed data services,\" said philip peters, telecommunications analyst and vice president of the lexington institute in arlington, virginia.mexico's own antitrust watchdog agency says telmex is a monopoly and an independent report by the organization for economic cooperation and development last year rapped the company for anti-competitive practices. telmex press relations officials provided data on the broadband network, but declined to arrange an interview or comment on complaints about broadband access.two internet companies say that telmex protected its own internet interests -- by making it tough for new isps to get the high-powered links they need.\"it's a huge, huge monopolistic problem, where people who want to sell internet service provider service in the market are being blocked out,\" said one executive.the same source said telmex did not flat out deny services, but was slow filling orders, \"and meanwhile they're trying to mop up demand in each of these areas.\"an executive at another major internet firm also complained about the delaying tactics and said telmex discriminated, making life difficult for some companies and not for others, depending on the relationship it has with them.the loudest complaints have come from avantel and alestra, which broke into mexico's long-distance market in 1997 and into high-capacity local service and isp services in the past year. avantel says telmex is breaking the law by refusing to provide the private line connections.avantel regulatory affairs director luis mancera displayed a nine-inch stack of avantel orders for connections since july 1999, all of which he said telmex has denied.telmex has said it refuses to sell avantel and alestra connections because the two owe hundreds of millions of dollars for special services it provided some time ago. avantel and alestra insist they have court orders suspending the payments.mancera says avantel has lost $17 million because telmex has refused connections and says the practice jeopardizes global contracts with large, multinational companies. in the case of a big customer, avantel will build its own high-capacity lines or install a microwave connection. but the huge investment is not worthwhile for low-traffic clients. mancera said that because other networks depend on telmex, high prices for high-speed data services will continue.the issue has led to international scrutiny. in january, spurred by complaints from at&t and mci worldcom, the u.s. federal communications commission fined telmex's u.s. operations $100,000, saying telmex violated an american long-distance operating agreement by refusing connections in mexico.the u.s. trade representative is also looking into complaints that mexico has broken international trade rules. if the ustr agrees with complaints from mci worldcom and others, it could take the case to the geneva-based world trade organization, which sets global trading rules.peters said that while telmex's behavior in mexico could damage its international reputation at a time when slim is expanding abroad, the mexican government has shown no interest in pressuring telmex.in january, cofetel president jorge nicolin said the agency, fearing telmex legal action, was backing down on a long-standing promise to curb its monopolistic practices.peters was pessimistic that cofetel's effort to broker talks between telmex and competitors would bring change any time soon.\"cofetel sounds like a spectator or mediator. the regulator simply has to regulate,\" he said."}
