and patients rather queasy. surprisingly, it may be a myth, according to a fair percentage of health-care providers and consumers attending the towards electronic personal records conference here on monday.many patients at the conference said they feel comfortable communicating online with their doctors and appreciate being able to locate their personal medical information on the internet.but that doesn't mean privacy and security weren't foremost on attendees' minds. in a move to assuage all parties' fears, an independent coalition presented a list of 14 principles to the 4,000 attending doctors, pharmacists, and health-care advocates, and encouraged all health-care sites to adhere to them.the conference's prevailing theme was that online medical information not only can offer more convenience and quicker treatment, but that posting it poses very little risk of security or privacy breaches as long as proper precautions are in place.\"not only is home where the heart is, but home is the heart of e-health,\" said dr. john yee, director of clinical electronic services for healthvision.yee echoed the opinions of his colleagues on the internet health-care panel that patients find it burdensome to visit the doctor's office for consultation. he cited studies that said 48 percent of online users would rather communicate with their doctors via email and that 63 percent of doctors email clients daily.to ease audience fears that privacy or doctor-patient confidentiality could be breached by exchanging personal medical information online, yee said the use of encryption and pins could practically ensure that only the doctor and patient have access to sensitive material.but because it's not 100 percent sure, another doctor emphasized the need for patients to be able to specify what personal information can be posted online.\"the internet is just a vehicle of communication, so the issue is who has access and security,\" said dr. helga rippen, chairwoman of the internet healthcare coalition that promotes quality online health-care transactions and resources. \"i think we all have to be concerned about having personal information online, based on who has access to that information.\"it's irrelevant whether it's on the internet or another system,\" added rippen, who led a panel discussion for consumers who asked which health sites provided the most comprehensive and accurate information.audience members and panelists seemed to agree that records stored at the doctor's office were more likely to be tampered with and contain errors, and that online records were more useful in the case of an emergency.one man who favored easy access to online medical information said that people wanting to steal medical information would do it whether it's online or off.\"i think they (medical records) should be there (online) with the right security, of course,\" the man said. \"they (healthcare websites) need to have many elaborate (security and privacy) things in place, but overall it's probably safer there than in the doctor's office.\"today there is no comprehensive and universal system to place medical records online, but many hospitals and insurance companies are looking to third parties to create it.thomas levin, president and ceo of the pre-ipo personalmd.com, said his company's core product \u2014- a personal homepage for each user containing medical data and news content chosen by the member -- already has 125,000 registered members. the company is closer to its 750,000-member goal for july now that it recently closed a deal with bluecross-blueshield of rhode island, to create personal sites for its 500,000 clients.blues patients are allowed to determine whether their information will be posted online, and levin said 20 percent of its current members update their sites at least once a month.\"what happens with our members is they quickly get a sense that they have control of information they did not have before,\" levin said. \"you're able to control medical information about yourself and this is valuable to a lot of people.\"levin said the ability for consumers to access their own records is a dramatic departure from the tradition that only doctors may view and alter a patient's medical records. he said privacy is protected because members must have a self-created pin to access their personal site and said personal data sent by the doctor or patient is encrypted so that only the party receiving the information can see it.levin added that if a patient wants to add, delete, or correct information to the record, a doctor has to communicate that information directly to the company; the patient can't do it alone.however, some doctors still remain wary of posting medical records online. they think it benefits third parties and tventure capitalists who fund them more than it does the patients themselves.dr. edward fotsch, president and ceo of the health site medem, said it would be a \"herculean task\" to get all doctors to comply with these internet companies and submit information.\"in my mind, medical records have clinical information from doctors and generally lots of lab information that comes from many different sources,\" he said. \"putting it online is a huge technical challenge because the information comes from so many sources.\"fotsch then said he does not know any patients, especially the terminally ill, who would like to see, for example, their colonoscopies online.but some online health providers insisted that easy access to medical records can save lives.glenn charlton, associate director of emergency care consultants in pennsylvania, called concerns surrounding privacy and security \"overblown.\"\"i've had fraud on my credit card, but it wasn't online, but a waiter,\" charlton said. \"if people want to break in, they will do it no matter where.\"meanwhile, health internet ethics, a coalition of 20 popular internet health sites, announced a set of security guidelines to ensure the consumer's privacy. while consequences for not following them have yet to be outlined, the coalition's 14 principles called for complete dissemination of how consumer information will be utilized.coalition members say their guidelines are consistent with the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996, which calls for the right of individuals to control how personal information is disseminated and asks that companies be extra cautious in handling personal information. the specific data-security measures companies must take have yet to be announced by the government.among the principles hi-ethics established are providing easily accessible privacy policies, providing risk information to consumers, maximizing network security, and ensuring the quality of health information content.coalition member doug levy, senior editor at the online drugstore planetrx, said health sites would be remiss not to adhere to the 14 principles.\"without that (consumer) trust, our businesses can't succeed,\" he said."}
