so in third generation, that was taken care of in changes to the auction rules earlier this year, but that didn't happen in second generation.\"however, the government has said it will not introduce a competition rule for 2g spectrum in the auction. \"the government considers that further delay in holding the auction may hold up the introduction of 3g services, and risk damaging new zealand's credibility with international investors,\" said acting communications minister trevor mallard.the government was confident that an earlier consultation with ihug would mean the judicial review was unlikely to be granted, mallard said, adding \"given the extensive consultation undertaken with ihug, i am confident there are no grounds on which to base a judicial review of the government's decisions.\"the government is also confident it will fend off a second request for an injunction from a group of new zealand m\u00e3ori. last year, the group argued that ownership of the spectrum was their right under the treaty of waitangi, new zealand's founding document.the treaty, signed in 1840 by m\u00e3ori leaders and the british government, promised to protect \"taonga,\" the m\u00e3ori term for resources considered valuable by new zealand's indigenous people. in 1840, those resources were land, forests, and fisheries but now m\u00e3ori believe the concept of taonga extends to the radio spectrum.\"since the signing of the treaty of waitangi, when neither the crown nor our tupuna (ancestors) knew about these pathways in the air, we have not sold them, we have not leased them, we have not given them away,\" the group wrote in an email note to supporters. \"accordingly, they must be ours or, at least, partly ours.\"a consulting body that advises the government on treaty issues agreed with the claimants last year but the government rejected its recommendation that the government negotiate with m\u00e3ori \"to reserve a fair and equitable portion\" of the spectrum for them.now the consulting group is asking the high court to again delay the auction to review this decision. a court official said the requests for injunctions would be considered later this week."}
