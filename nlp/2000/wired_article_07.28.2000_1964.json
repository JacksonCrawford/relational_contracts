he said that resentment toward the music industry has been building for some time. \"if the riaa is going to tell 20 million users 'you are all thieves,' what do you expect?\" said jones. \"the public is rebelling because a lot of people are pissed off about the price of cds.\"but jones doesn't think this boycott will get a lot of traction. \"while i appreciate the passion, and while i'd like to believe there's power in numbers, i don't think that there are enough numbers,\" said jones. \"people will bitch and complain and cry while they hand $20 across the counter for a cd.\"slashdot has been one of the many sources where napster users have debated what to do. some people recognize that the riaa is fighting music piracy.\"as a musician i do not agree with the unauthorized distribution of my music,\" wrote one slashdot participant. \"whether or not mp3 sharing helps me and gets me album sales is irrelevant. if i don't want my creation to become public domain, then no one has the right to make it otherwise.\"word of the boycott is getting out even across the pond to places like guilford, england. napster user \"assimilator\" plans to support his american counterparts. \"i believe the boycott will only have a significant effect if all napster users go along with it and they tell their family and friends to join, too,\" he said.\"assimilator\" said he downloads mp3s as a way to try records before buying them, which has resulted in him making purchases, and that's why he's supporting the boycott, even though it's primarily taking place in the u.s.\"i want to show (the riaa) what proportion of their sales are napster users so that they realize that extra revenue is being generated as a result of napster,\" he said.but the retail music stores don't seem to be sweating the prospect of reduced sales. best buy declined to comment on the boycott, and a representative of musicland stores, which owns the sam goody chain of mall-based record stores, was reluctant to guess how sales might be affected. \"we can't predict the future so we can't forecast sales,\" said lisa svac, a spokeswoman for the minneapolis, minnesota-based chain.musicland has embraced selling digital samples from new releases on its website, which it said has helped boost sales. \"we find that as people get a small sample or a taste of a product, they determine if they like it, it does spur them to sales,\" said svac.musicland reported quarterly sales earlier this month that showed revenue and net income rising over the previous year, and an explosion in their digital sales. electronic revenues in the second quarter were $1.7 million, compared to $.03 million in the second quarter of 1999."}
