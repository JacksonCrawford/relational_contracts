about napster ... the land of the forgotten expo ... and this week's deals ... as brad king spins the week in digital music news.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "business", "type": "article",

in los angeles last week as napster ceo hank barry, company founder shawn fanning, and bertelsmann ecommerce group ceo andreas schmidt relived their recent press conference.building on the hype from two weeks ago when the two companies announced a joint venture that could end litigation against the file-trading company, the boys reassembled on stage to talk around the important issues.not so shockingly, no definite answers came from it. but as always, there were interesting read-between-the-lines moments. despite the smiles and back slapping, there are two questions that continue to plague the new venture:where does security fit into this?and what does the new file-trading network look like?to the first question:\"all of these security measures can be put on a spectrum,\" barry said. \"you can put music in a vault, nine stories below the earth and it's secure. or you could set it out in the middle of town and it's free. what you do along the way really determines how much access you are going to give to the consumer.\"that was followed by this: \"sometimes i think the music industry competes with the nsa in terms of security,\" schmidt said. \"we need to look at this from the customer's point of view. you can build out a basic technology first and then improve on it later.\"we have to compensate the rights holders, so there needs to be a basic control. but we can't mess up the consumer experience.\"this leads into the second question of how the network and business model would develop.it has been reported that the new service will contain three tiers.the top level would be an all-you-can-eat buffet of downloadable music that costs $4.95 per month to use. the midlevel would encompass some kind of pay-per-download model. the low level would be some version of the current free napster service.\"it would be very discouraging if that was part of the business model,\" said barry, who thinks this three-tiered system would be too cumbersome for consumers. \"you want people on the system, you want people to share, and that is what the core of napster is.\"---napster redux ii: recording industry association of america ceo hilary rosen, and motion picture association of america ceo jack valenti, had their own stage one day later.valenti nearly stole the show, spinning yarns and playing country bumpkin. in between tales of dog sleds and backwoods hunting, valenti got around to talking about the mpaa's new digital strategy division -- which is analyzing ways for the movie industry to distribute their content online.since only about 20 percent of the 443 movies released in the last year figure to make money, valenti stressed the importance of finding new, cheaper revenue streams for distribution.\"if i wasn't in this business, i'd be file sharing because i think it's a hell of an idea,\" valenti said. \"we decided a long time ago to be part of the digital world. there are only about three million users on broadband. without broadband, i could dog sled from here to seattle quicker than you could download a movie.\"of course, valenti is still allowed some breathing room since the only popular multimedia file-sharing service, scour, announced it will soon shut down for good.---the forgotten expo: one of the dirty little conference secrets is that the expo -- where companies send employees to endure eight-hour days of waiting for someone to stop by and ask about their products -- are notoriously big money-makers.you can fund a whole year's worth of activities by lining up dozens of businesses to pay between $2,000 and $5,000 for booth placement.the problem this year for webnoize and other conferences is the money crunch facing the industry. several booths went unmanned -- which is fine if you're a lunar module company, and not so great if you're a consumer-oriented business. most of the faces populating the expo were new as well. there was talk that not one major sponsor was repeating from last year.that's not a reflection of the conference. it's a testament to the hard times people are facing -- because music people, even if they are in technology, are notorious for their parties. and conferences are where the best parties take place.---the deals gone down: but it's not all fun and games. here's a quick look at this week's deals.liquid audio (lqid) will be selling music from independent label zomba records group.... myplay.com will integrate its locker service into etc music's in-store music kiosk musicteller to allow users to download music into portable music players.... emusic (emus) has added classical music to its mp3 catalogue.... gearing up for the inevitable radio-on-demand services, radioamp launched its personalized news, weather, and sports applications.... in talks with yahoo, digital music jukebox company musicmatch rolled out the latest upgrade to its system."}
