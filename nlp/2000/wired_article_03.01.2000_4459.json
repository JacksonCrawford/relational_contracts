not only is she black, she's naked and jumping off a cliff. that's certainly in the spirit of your two covers featuring black men. they've both been criminals: o.j. simpson (wired 3.03) and a cracker (wired 2.12). i'm sure this is all just unconscious creativity. but that's the problem: unconsciousness!__ joseph edwardsjoed@mindspring.com __wired's december cover is one of the most arresting images i've seen in a long time. it's why i bought this issue.__ jack pughjpugh@wyoming.com ____ gorey ending __the article on al gore (\"where's tech support when you need it?\" wired 7.12, page 312) reveals both his understanding of the electronic explosion and his inability - because of a lack of charisma - to develop a following among the power brokers involved. end of story for gore.__ jerry menelljmenell@jmcav.com ____ the cult of cute __as owner of a children's gift shop, i never cease to be surprised at the sales generated by sanrio's kawaii - i.e., cute - products (\"cute inc.,\" wired 7.12, page 332). i am even more surprised at the age of customers who cannot live without the newest sanrio creation. our most recent example is an energetic woman in her eighties who has been purchasing badtz-maru figures as birthday gifts for her eightysomething friends.__ kimberley fitchpeacockf@mindspring.com __since when is cute a synonym for annoying?__ sean merriganlefty@flashcom.net __thanks for your on-target article on japan's cute industry. anyone who has spent time in japan knows that cuteness abounds in even the most unlikely places: hand towels, coffee mugs, household slippers, rice cookers, you name it.the story did resort, however, to some exoticizing of japan, a country that consists largely of normal people living normal lives - despite a penchant for cuteness. most japanese find the schoolgirls'-used-panty vending-machine industry distasteful. this shocking and oft-mentioned example of alleged japanese perversity is not as common as the american media would like us to believe.__ john treibertreiber@cris.com ____ less d, more r __thomas a. bass' article on interval (\"think tanked,\" wired 7.12, page 204) was an excellent view into research. it's too bad such an interesting organization has to enslave itself, like the rest, to the bottom line. nonetheless, i do hope interval tries to approach its marketing in the spirit with which it conducted research.__ marcus del grecomindmined@llamalinks.com ____ risk assessment __your story on clay struve (\"got risk?\" wired 7.12, page 148) explained better than any finance article why long-term capital management failed and what the supervisory community will have to do to prevent a recurrence of the ltcm fiasco. you've done a hell of a service to the banking industry and the world that depends on it.__ robert gumerlockrobert@gumerlock.org ____ just do it __i'd like to ask klaus schwab just whose world it is that he and the members of the world economic forum hope to improve (\"global power, straight up,\" wired 7.12, page 350) - you don't win the nobel peace prize by making billionaires out of millionaires. then i'd like to ask nike, davos' newest company, whether it has considered cutting into profits to pay its third-world laborers a living wage.__ alex gaalagaal@netzero.net ____ feeling dumped on __i take great exception to the inclusion of multilevel marketing on the list of 100 things that shouldn't survive into the next century (\"dump file,\" wired 7.12, page 395). the heyday of mlm is yet to come: it's a powerful medium in this day of advertising saturation. high tech requires high touch; only in mlm can a technology be demonstrated in millions of homes at no cost to the manufacturer. greater acceptance of mlm is just around the corner; in the future, everyone will be involved with mlm, whether as customers or distributors.__ john m. von pischkejmvp@bigplanet.com __if i wanted to read tim cavanaugh's stand-for-nothing, dis-everything agnostic frothings, i'd log onto suck.com. no beatles, no star wars, no 007? cutting-edge cynicism hardly seems worth the price.__ curt cloningercurt@lab404.com __ouch!
