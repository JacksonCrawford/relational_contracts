company blames their sagging revenues on the millennium bug scare and expects to recover by years end. their burgeoning internet component supply business could be the light at the end of the tunnel.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "01.19.2000 02:30 PM", "text": "ibm, hardest hit among major computer makers by the year 2000 computer bug, reported wednesday that fourth quarter earnings fell 10 percent from a year earlier, but exceeded lowered analyst expectations. but revenue for the world's largest supplier of computer hardware, software, and services fell 4 percent to us$24.2 billion, below wall street's hopes, amid declining sales of each of its four main hardware product lines.fourth quarter net income fell to $2.1 billion, or $1.12 per share, compared with $2.3 billion, or $1.24 per share, recorded in the year-earlier fourth quarter.the latest quarter's results were 6 cents per share ahead of the earnings consensus of $1.06 per share, according to first call/thomson financial, which surveys brokerage estimates. the consensus view had reflected lower guidance ibm (ibm) gave in meetings with analysts in october and again in december.\"as we had anticipated, the y2k issue hit us hard in the fourth quarter,\" louis gerstner, ibm's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement reporting the resultshowever, he noted that while fourth quarter results declined, net profits for the full 1999-year were a record, growing roughly 22 percent and its internet supply business represented a growing percentage of its revenues.\"ibm -- with the broadest portfolio of products and services in the industry -- is exceptionally well positioned to benefit from ... growing e-business demand,\" gerstner said. \"we continue to believe that, once the y2k transition is completed, this can be a very good year for ibm.\"ibm officials have blamed the shortfall on a spending pause on new computer systems by some large corporate customers as they sought to avert potential millennium bug computer crashes, especially among large banks and financial service customers.after the report, john joyce, who two months ago was named ibm's chief financial officer, warned that first quarter results would continue to be hurt by the lockdown on new computer purchases that began in the fourth quarter.he predicted that first-quarter profits would be flat or slightly below the 78 cents per share reported in the first quarter of 1999, repeating the company's prior caution.joyce also advised wall street analysts against taking the y2k-crippled fourth quarter results as a guide to modeling how financial results would play out during the whole of the year 2000.ulric weil, an analyst at brokerage friedman, billings, ramsey, said his initial reaction was that the decline in revenues could raise concern among investors on thursday.\"the street is becoming very discriminating, and revenues are the key. look at microsoft and motorola -- they all beat their [earnings] number ... but the stocks got manhandled. the same could happen to ibm,\" weil said.for the 1999-year as a whole, ibm had revenue of $87.5 billion, up 7 percent from 1998, following strong sales growth in the first half of 1999.excluding the effect of translating revenue earned in foreign currencies into a generally stronger us dollar, fourth quarter revenues would have declined only 2 percent.geographically, revenues fell 4 percent to $10.4 billion in ibm americas region, down 4 percent from the 1998 fourth quarter. europe/middle east/africa revenue fell 15 percent to $7.2 billion, but would have declined only 6 percent, if the effects of a strong us dollar had been normalized.asia-pacific revenue rose 12 percent to $4.4 billion, but would have grown only 2 percent had it not been for the favorable effects of gains in the japanese yen against the dollar.a bright point in the dismal growth picture was the company's booming technology component supply business, which grew 12 percent to $2.2 billion. but ibm's overall hardware revenues declined 11 percent to $10.2 billion from the 1998 fourth quarter.a drop in demand for its system/390, as/400, rs/6000, and pc lines, related to y2k, was a significant factor behind fourth-quarter revenue decreases.revenues from servers, the powerful computers used to manage networks of other machines, declined 34 percent overall, while pc revenues declined 11 percent.revenues from ibm global services, including its mainframe maintenance business, but excluding the effect of the sale of pieces of its ibm global network internet access business to at&t last fall, grew 2 percent to $8.7 billion.joyce said services growth was hurt by a fall-off in y2k services repair work, which had previously accounted for a tenth of services work.ibm's services revenues have traditionally grown in the high-single digits in percentage terms, excluding the drag of declining revenues from its aging mainframe maintenance business,ibm said it signed $10.3 billion in new services contracts in the quarter and concluded the year with a total services contract backlog of about $60 billion, which represents 20 percent growth from the year-earlier, joyce said. services work generated about 36 percent of total revenues, it said."}
