online. but how far will musicians and labels go to promote their tracks? by christopher jones.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "03.03.2000 03:00

but how will online music fans feel about ad banners that pop up every time they listen to a music track?new york-based everad will test that concept with a new technology that embeds banner ads in the free music tracks listeners download to a pc. when the track is played, a revolving series of ads comes up regardless of whether a user is online or offline, and stays in the forefront of the screen during the duration of the song.since the ad banners appear every time a song is played, it does run the risk of annoying some listeners. but if people like the music they will accept the ads, said jason pascal, executive director of everad's playj music division.\"the trade is a fair one to make, similar to network television or radio,\" he said. \"you're getting a certain level of programming in exchange for advertising, and the ads themselves are relatively small and nonobtrusive.\"up to this point, artists haven't seen much real revenue from online music. but new business models are starting to offer some promise, including royalty schemes for streamed music and various methods of selling downloadable tracks.everad's plan is to split the ad revenues 50-50 with the distributors, who in turn compensate the labels and artists.bradley johnson, interactive editor for advertising age said the everad technology has good potential.\"we've seen time and again how things on the internet morph from pay to free,\" johnson said. \"the internet is an amazing place where consumers have become accustomed to getting so much for 'nothing.' we're in an era of free isps, free pcs, free content, and this plays right along. the internet is one big free-for-all.\"whether artists will like the idea of tying their music to banner ads is another question.pat dinizio, the former lead singer of the smithereens who now sells solo tracks through liquid audio, said that musicians need to really consider how they promote themselves and their music on the net, just as they have with other mediums in the past.\"any videos that the smithereens did were largely performance pieces that didn't attempt to tell any kind of story because you don't want that music associated with anything specific,\" he explained. \"now, if a certain song available as this [playj] download reaches enough people with an ad attached to it, you're going to think of the ad.\"\"it gets back to purity. you're sending some bizarre message whereby anytime you hear this song, because you've gotten it for free, you have to suffer looking at a commercial,\" he added.other music sites have initiated ad-sharing models in online music, but the playj files are one of the first instances of ad banners tied to specific music tracks, which in turn can be targeted to specific demographics.the internet underground music archive, one of the oldest net music sites, splits 25 percent of its advertising revenue between all the unsigned bands on its site. mp3.com has cut artists in on ad revenue through its payback for playback program, and sites like riffage.com and artistdirect have similar profit-sharing models.aol's spinner division, which broadcasts about 150 music channels, has a proprietary technology for embedding ads in its streams, which are synchronized with banner ads.likewise, sites like mjuice have built a secure mp3 format that includes a pop-up screen tied to the tracks, giving listeners artwork and information about the artist.andrew de vries, vice president of marketing at mjuice, said the company has experimented with putting ads in tracks, but those ads primarily provide information about the artist and the label. another advertising vehicle mjuice uses is its download wizard.\"what we like about doing it as part of the download process is that while you're waiting for it, why not show somebody an ad?\" de vries said.everad's biggest challenge, he said, will be getting support for their new format in the existing, popular players.like mjuice, everad's music format is proprietary and is an encrypted version of mp3, which ties the ads to the music. the security also prevents tracks from being burned onto cd-r discs or sent to mp3 portables.\"i think it's [playj] a good idea, but i think it's going to be hard for them to get critical mass,\" de vries said. \"instead they should find a way to get the technology to work with the formats already out there, like real and liquid and us and others. i think it will be an uphill battle otherwise,\" he said.pascal said the company is trying to get support for playj in the winamp, realnetworks and musicmatch players.the cost of the ads will be about $15 \"cost per mega\" (cpm), or per 1,000 impressions. each track will include eight to 10 spots, and a user must view a spot for 20 seconds for it to count as an impression. doubleclick and netgravity will place and track ad impressions, and everad will collect data on every song a user plays, how often, and for how long.currently, johnson said, cpm rates for ads on the internet run anywhere from $5 to $60, depending on how targeted an ad is. in the case of playj, he said advertisers probably would be interested in testing it out because music provides a good opportunity to target young audiences, one of the most desirable groups to reach.\"younger people are called consumers for a reason. they consume a lot of stuff,\" he said.the playj ads will be similar to the dynamic banner ads found on today's web sites, but may get more creative in the future.\"we're planning on using this technology to move into other areas which will require more animated advertising,\" pascal said. \"for now, we're trying to stay in line with the banners that ad agencies have already created.\"everad has a list of record labels that are ready to use the technology and, pascal said, \"we are in discussions with two of the majors, and one pretty seriously.\""}
