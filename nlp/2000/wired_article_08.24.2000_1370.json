distribution. lately, it's been getting easier and easier to find. by lynn burke.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "security", "type": "article", "timestamp": "08.24.2000 03:00 AM", "text": "when wayne camolli emerged in handcuffs from his dilapidated, roach-infested home in a florida suburb last week, he looked every bit the kid porn peddler -- investigators said he had a \"kind of unabomber appearance.\" it was a relief to many in one noticeable aspect: he did not look like the man next door.but while camolli and his living conditions made for sensational television coverage, he isn't the poster boy for child pornography that some might have hoped. and he isn't nearly as underground.in fact, this man was so out in the open with his trade that he operated a very public email group on egroups.com, a site that caters to a mainstream internet audience. and his group, called \"picman's_list,\" announced rather openly that it was \"dedicated to nude male teen and twink (slang for young boys) pix.\"perhaps more disturbing is the fact that this one list had over 3,000 members.disturbing, yes, experts say. but not surprising.\"the internet has made it much easier for child pornography traders and collectors to ply their trade,\" said layne lathram, spokesperson for the u.s. customs service, the government agency responsible for handling the vast majority of child pornography cases.gone are the days when one had to travel to the seedy corner store and ask for the contraband material under the counter, or face the mailman delivering a brown paper package, she said. \"they can sit there in their basement and feel relatively anonymous in front of their computers. it is now a faceless exchange.\"and as the numbers of arrests continue to grow, the evidence of exactly who is sitting behind those computers shows that everyone from business executives to suburban housewives are in on it -\u2013 the kind of people who do live next door.\"in the old days, before the internet, before the ease of communication, pedophilia and child pornography were disgraceful things,\" said lathram.she said the fear of getting caught prevented most people from acting out on their predilections then. now, people go onto newsgroups and find forums like \"dadsanddaughters\" and \"babyrape,\" she said, and suddenly don't feel so alone.\"they're finding validation out there,\" said lathram. \"they say, 'wow! look! i'm not so bad, i'm pretty mainstream.'\"egroups is far from alone in having this problem. aol is often cited by law enforcement officials as an isp that has grappled with illegal distribution of pornography since the mid-1990s.experts say there are several reasons for the mainstreaming of this illegal fetish, and technology is always at the top of the list.\"if i'm going to blame anything, i'm going to blame the technology,\" said fred lane, internet pornography expert and author of obscene profits: the entrepreneurs of pornography in the cyber agedistribution is almost a no-brainer these days, he said, and manufacturing has become a whole lot easier with the introduction of the digital camera.\"all it takes is a fairly forceful adult with a digital camera,\" he said.indeed, the world of child pornography has undergone a sea change in the last few years. experts say the relatively static pool of illegal images produced in the 1970s has given way to a new crop of photographs.\"we're starting to see a significant growth in the production of new child pornography,\" lane said.u.s. customs special agent greg stine, who works on child pornography cases full-time in palm beach county, florida, agrees.\"i think that's a fair assessment,\" he said. \"child pornography -- it's like kicking over a rock and ants scurrying everywhere.\"child pornography fighters like parry aftab, an internet lawyer who operates online safety site cyberangels, sees this growth firsthand.\"it used to be nonexistent 10 years ago, but now it's growing by leaps and bounds,\" she said. \"we're finding 70 sites a day \u2013- i have 7,000 volunteers in 70 countries. that's scary.\"aftab, who wrote the parent's guide to protecting your children in cyberspace said child porn traders are so numerous they have an easy time staying one step ahead of the feds. knowing that newsgroups are often populated by undercover agents, she said, many kid porn users have moved over to mainstream email clubs, like the egroups club where camolli was ultimately caught.egroups.com, which was acquired by yahoo in late june, appears as ripe a place for any to find like-minded individuals for child pornography. a search for \"child porn\" on egroups calls up such groups as \"childpornonly\" and \"high-qualityyoungladypics\" -\u2013 a group that warns its members not to post \"any obvious child porn.\"there's also \"under21females,\" a group that warns \"no child porn\" but says in the same e-breath that \"under 18 is ok.\"officials at egroup.com did not return telephone calls for this article.\"it's gotten so big that child porn users are thumbing their nose at regular people,\" she said. \"the more mainstream they become, the more likely they're going to run into regular people who will be outraged ... they've made a big mistake. they've gotten greedy.\"and they're getting caught. according to u.s. customs service records, 204 individuals were arrested on child pornography charges in 1999. that's a significant increase from five years ago, when 48 arrests were made. and customs has a pretty good track record on obtaining convictions in these cases. records show that nearly all of the individuals arrested were later convicted.the fbi, which also investigates child pornography cases, has made a total of 580 arrests and 525 convictions since the 1995 introduction of its \"innocent images\" program, an initiative that coordinates investigations at each fbi field office to avoid duplicate efforts.the u.s. postal inspection service is also charged with investigating child pornography cases. and though the cases it investigates concern kid porn sent through the physical mail, officers say numbers are up due to the internet.\"eighty percent of last year's cases had a nexus to computers and the internet,\" said postal inspector tony esposito.he said people meet each other online, and trade and sell images offline. \"it's a lot easier for them to send a disk through the mail,\" he said. \"a cd can contain hundreds of images.\"postal inspection service statistics show that in 1999, 160 individuals were served with search warrants, and 147 of the suspects were convicted on child pornography charges. esposito said 48 of those convicted were child molesters, and as a result of the investigations, 84 children were identified and rescued.who is behind these crimes? officials say there is no typical child porn peddler.\"people think of the pudgy pink pedophile in the raincoat, drooling at the edge of the playground,\" she said. \"that's just not it.\"experts like lane say the mainstreaming of child pornography shouldn't come as much of a shock, given the prevalence of the suggestive images of teen celebrities such as britney spears and christina aguilera.\"as a culture, we're spending more time promoting the sexuality of young people. it shouldn't be a surprise to take that one step further,\" said lane.a quick scan through hundreds of headlines over the last few years obliterates the myth of the raincoat man. a suburban couple in fort worth, texas, a real estate investor in san diego, a retired air force pilot in kennebunk, maine, an investigator for the nevada gaming control commission, and a presbyterian priest in new jersey are all among the hundreds of individuals charged with possession and distribution of child pornography over the last couple of years.wayne camolli might have grabbed attention last week as he was led away from his trash-filled home by federal agents decked out in haz-mat gear and oxygen tanks.but the profile of a child pornography offender is often much more mundane.\"it runs the gamut,\" said lathram. \"it is the person next door.\""}
