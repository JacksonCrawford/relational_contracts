(see \"data storm,\" wired 3.01, page 39.)the company, which is named for the group of '60s radicals from ann arbor, has drawn fans from some unlikely quarters. \"a couple of weather underground members contacted us, and at first we were kind of nervous,\" masters said. \"but they just called to tell us that they liked the site.\"must readthe eballot and the bulletdistance makes the heart grow strongermp3 meets mpaaask dr. bobcaught in the actnow that's slugging percentage!peoplejargon watchnasa's backup backupdns gets tongue lashingvirtual viral marketing virusthe weather overgroundraw data"}
