we want to create an opportunity and tools for kids to control technology.\"certainly that was the goal with the lego mindstorms product line aimed at older kids. mindstorms products use programmable bricks that connect with pcs to allow kids to build customized robots and robotic vehicles.child development experts are universally enthusiastic about the lego-medialab research and the products that have emerged thus far from the partnership.\"oh, mindstorms is a wonderful line,\" said hillary rettig, editor of technocopia. \"the whole purpose of play should be relaxed, non-threatening activities that allow kids to think creatively and express themselves. a product like mindstorms adds technology into the mix, giving kids the tools to actually build the toys they dream up.\"the tools are also seductive to parents, who hope that techno toys will better prepare kids for the demands of school and the workplace.established companies like mattel (which formed the smart toy lab with intel) and fisher-price are creating and rolling out more technology-enhanced toys, while newer firms like vtech and neurosmith are upping the ante with toys like neurosmith's create-your-own-symphony music blocks.some of the new toys are cool enough to evoke a \"wow\" even from jaded adults; the toy manufacturers of america association notes that almost a full third of lego mindstorms products sold were to grown ups. but experts warn parents not to let that gee-whiz reaction blind them to the possible downside of smart toys.\"just because a toy has a little bit of computer intelligence inside doesn't mean it teaches kids anything,\" rettig said. \"most people would call a furby a smart toy but when you get down to it, what does it really teach a kid? sixty bucks worth of paint and clay would be a much better bet for kids' development than a $60 furby.\"\"a lot of toys with electronics don't teach kids anything,\" agreed diane cardinale of the toy manufacturers of america. \"and they're so expensive that the results hardly justify the costs. better to buy your kid a $2 jump rope or a basic set of blocks than an electronic toy that doesn't teach.\"some toys may even be harmful. rettig knows a child who was traumatized by a squalling, bleeping, 3-foot robot, and others who have been terrified of talking dolls and toys. rettig and cardinale both recommend that parents not get caught up in how cool a toy is and instead make sure that a smart toy's extra expense is justified by impressive teaching features.\"kids should have a variety of options,\" cardinale said. \"high-tech toys, squishy teddy bears, building blocks, matchbox cars, things that are kid-powered as well as computer-powered. traditional toys have much to recommend them. parents shouldn't lose sight of that.\"parents who hope their kids will grow up to be the next bill gates or esther dyson sometimes forget that techno toys don't automatically turn a regular kid into a computer genius, rettig said.\"what they should remember is that the leaders of the computer industry now didn't grow up playing with advanced smart toys,\" she said. \"they grew up taking apart clocks and playing with erector sets. \"kids today can learn the same valuable lessons they did, and without (their parents) paying hundreds of dollars for advanced toys.\""}
