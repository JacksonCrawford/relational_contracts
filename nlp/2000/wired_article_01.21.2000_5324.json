nightmare. service and support are horrible. do you really want to go there? subscribers say yes. by michelle finley.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp":

this article, please send an e-mail to sourceinfo[at]wired.com.digital subscriber line (dsl) service was supposed to provide consumers with a ticket to high-speed heaven. for many users, it's become a fast trip to hell.complaints of long waits for the service to be activated, terrible technical support, and erratic and unstable connections litter the comp.dcom.xdsl newsgroup and account for a large share of the postings on dslreports.com.dsl providers have been overwhelmed with requests for the service, which, they insist, is a central cause of the problems some subscribers are experiencing. \"we just didn't expect that everyone and his mother would want dsl,\" a spokesperson from earthlink-sprint said.research by the yankee group shows 300,000 residential dsl subscribers at the end of 1999 with a projected total of 900,000 subscribers by the end of 2000. that's up from virtually none in 1998 when the service was largely unavailable.downloading data over a dsl connection is anywhere from eight to 100 times faster than downloading with dial-up modems, depending on the level of dsl service a user selects. basic dsl costs about us$50 a month, while a standard dial-up account costs less than half that.despite its problems, dsl remains poised to become the high-speed access of choice, having surpassed isdn among home users a few years back.price issues doomed isdn. hardcore net users, isdn's prime audience, balked at the pay-per-minute metered pricing structure.but the rising tide of consumer complaints may cause many users to skip over dsl and wait for the \"next\" broadband technology.justin beech launched dslreports.com in june after his own arduous search for a dsl provider.\"i picked probably the worst isp in new york, bell atlantic,\" said beech, who's currently connecting via a dial-up modem.\"i now find that canceling the service and doing a switch to another isp is impossible because bell will not release the line, although they would be happy to disconnect it and bill me for the remainder of the contract,\" he said.a bell atlantic official declined to address beech's situation but said most of their customers' problems could not have been predicted until the product was launched, and that they are working on correcting them.\"while we thoroughly tested dsl in the laboratory and conducted trials of the service before we started offering it, some issues could not have been foreseen until dsl was deployed to the mass market,\" said joan rasmussen, director of media relations at bell atlantic.\"we know there have been some hiccups for our dsl customers,\" she added. \"these are issues that the entire industry is facing, not just bell atlantic.\"bell atlantic has hired several hundred dsl customer support reps within the past month, rasmussen said. the company has also been working to streamline installations, offering optional do-it-yourself installations and connection kits with everything needed to get computers dsl-ready.further complicating the matter, dsl requires the coordinated efforts of several companies. an isp has to work with a competitive local exchange carrier (clec), such as northpoint or covad, then obtain a local loop from the regional bell.\"getting connected is usually the biggest struggle,\" beech said. \"what starts as a simple phone call ordering service often ends up in a complex and confusing blizzard of appointments and finger pointing between the isp, the dsl network, and the clec.\"\"we are certainly aware that there are some customers who are frustrated with the dsl install process, but we feel very strongly that those customers are in the minority,\" said scott chase, senior vice president of corporate communications at firstworld, a colorado-based dsl service provider.\"i would wager big bucks that the reason that firstworld thinks the majority of their customers are happy is because most of us haven't been able to contact them with our complaints,\" says george andres of sausalito, california.\"i've spent many hours on hold with firstworld, and when i do get through it's not unusual for them to cut me off when they -- as they inevitably do -- transfer the call. and you never get a call back.\"\"luckily, waiting for the service installation of my firstworld dsl taught me patience,\" andres jokes. \"it took three months to set up an appointment, and then they failed to show up for the first three appointments.\"\"andres finally got his service, which he describes as \"shaky.\"some days it's super fast, some days it drops to 56k dial-up speeds. also, my connection often gets dropped off after roughly 100 minutes, a problem that more than a few dsl users have reported.\"responds firstworld's chase: \"we are working diligently to address the demand for dsl and to make sure that all of our customers receive the best service possible. in fact, to date, we have cut down our average install time, from an industry average of 8-10 weeks to five weeks.\"truly awful tech support is another big issue customers face. help-line staffs have been strained to the breaking point with the huge demand for dsl support. then too, dsl customers tend to be technically advanced users. they don't like being treated like net newbies.\"there's no follow-though, you never get a call back, and there's no problem-tracking,\" fumed dan rudy of laguna beach, california.\"the support people run me through the same lame script over and over, each time i call. after being asked multiple times whether i was sure that my computer was on, i was told that i was basically flashcom's guinea pig with this new technology and i'd just have to bear with them.\"deb franklin of cleveland, ohio, says she couldn't even get flashcom to turn the service on. \"i ordered dsl service from the company on 27 august and was told the line would be up by 10 october. appointments were made twice, i took the day off from work, and both times they never showed up to set up the service.\"i've called at least 10 times, spent hours on hold, and sent about a dozen emails which went unanswered. i've got a $100 charge on my credit card, plus i lost two days of pay,\" said franklin, adding she has given up on getting dsl.flashcom president and ceo richard rasmus acknowledged that his company had had some problems. \"there are also problems that span the dsl service industry as a whole. we are taking steps to put solutions in place,\" he said.flashcom has recently made a substantial investment in its internal it structure, putting in place a system that tracks service calls, support issues, and billing. the company's new back-office system was deployed this week, rasmus said.the next step is to hook parts of the database to the web so customers can track the status of their orders and get self-help support, freeing technicians to handle more complicated queries.dsl isn't hell for every user. some are connected with ease and have never had to call for technical assistance. and even disgruntled users admit that dsl is worth all the trouble.\"dsl is a technology struggling to live up to its own marketing,\" beech said. \"we early adopters can be very vocal and difficult to please. but despite all the difficulties, very few people would give up their dsl. once you've experienced broadband access, you would rather chew on tinfoil than go back to using a regular mode.\""}
