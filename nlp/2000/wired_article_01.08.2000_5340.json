(wiredplanet has no connection to wired news.)\"you might like that station, but tomorrow it might be off the air. we run our own servers with our own content,\" hale said.expo attendees liked the ampradio model.\"if you're a musician and you need to get ideas for styles and you're dry, you could hop on here and get ideas,\" said bob nafarrete, a keyboardist who watched the presentation at the expo, and runs his own recording studio in san francisco.the software will be a venue for lesser known artists to get airplay, bernthol said.\"it's tough to make it in this business, and this technology evens the score a bit,\" bernthol said.\"and it can be done with practically no investment at all,\" said vinay venkatesh, a graphic designer and webmaster at subband.bernthol cited the example of the band creed, which recently booted the bigger-name garth brooks down to number two on the charts. creed made several of its tracks available for free on the internet, which some say is the reason the band's album did so well.bernthol compared burgeoning technologies like ampradio to the proliferation of cable tv satellite dishes.\"it's the concept of mass information for everyone. it's not a matter of mp3s but of the latest technology,\" bernthol said. \"it's fundamentally the causative radio free europe.\""}
