could go in the sick and disgusting file, but it's a strong community for those who need to mod their bods. by michelle finley.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "culture", "type": "article",

sources cited in this article, please send an e-mail to sourceinfo[at]wired.com.when he was 10 years old, shannon larrat occasionally passed the time by biting deep gouges on the inside of his cheeks and threading electrical wire through them.later in life he sliced his flesh open with razor blades, tattooed himself, got his ears, nipples, and genitals pierced, and pressed hot metal against his skin to create raised scars.it wasn't until he was 21, he says, that he began modifying his body on a \"pure\" level, unrelated to any form of self-abusive behavior.\"some of the mods i did on myself were certainly a sign of being 'not right,'\" he said. \"rather than trying to achieve a concise goal of changing my body to suit my inner visions and desires, what i was doing was primarily self-destructive. i had other problems in my life and they were physically manifesting themselves in my body.\"now 29 and a resident of toronto, larrat designs custom software and large-scale telephone systems. he's also the webmaster of body modification ezine, a sort of by-membership cyber-community center for people who choose to change their bodies in, um, interesting ways.larrat first went online back in 1994 primarily so that he could read and participate in rec.arts.bodyart, a usenet newsgroup focusing on body modification. shortly after, he discovered the web and set up a personal page displaying photos of his piercings and tattoos. people visited -- and in large numbers -- what was then a very small and humble homepage. and they started sending larrat their own photos and stories to add to the site.so he formalized his web site into bme, a space where people could freely share their body modification interests. larrat now gets about 5,000 photo submissions a month and about 500 articles. he estimates the site has at least 20,000 regular readers.bme presents information on a wide range of flesh-altering possibilities in full and sometimes gruesome detail. the site is divided into two sections. section 1 features pictures, stories, and links to information on what are now considered the \"mainstream\" modifications: tattoos, piercing, scarification, and branding.the second section, bme/extreme, is private. people get a password to this section only by submitting materials for publication.but the extreme faqs are public, intended as a resource for those who are looking for some information on subjects like do-it-yourself amputation and castration, tongue-splitting and tooth-filing, implanting objects under the skin, and temporary and permanent fingernail removal.larrat has provoked rage within certain segments of the tattoo and piercing business by publishing information on the more extreme forms of body modification -- particularly the articles that provide do-it-yourself-tips.\"the way i see it, most of the people doing these procedures will do them no matter what, so if i can pass a little bit of information along to them to make it safer, i will,\" he said. \"i hope that people will read the information with common sense and intelligence ... and then make a rational decision as to their actions.\"larrat feels that much of the ire people direct at him stems from a prejudice against extreme body modifications that exists within the mainstream tattooing and piercing culture.most people who are into piercings and tattoos largely just making a fashion statement, he thinks, whereas people who do more radical changes to their bodies have made a much \"deeper commitment\" and are generally more open-minded.jade, who writes for tattoo savage, a newsstand publication, disagrees. \"it's not just a matter of being open-minded. i think that a lot of people who have tattoos and piercings feel that it has some true aesthetic value, and would rather not be associated with things that i think most anyone with any common sense would see as self-destructive at the worst, and just plain ugly at best.\"larrat disapproves only of involuntary body modification (anything done without the full and educated consent of the person being altered) and modifications that are done for what he considers the wrong reasons.he defines \"wrong reason\" as \"self-abusive behavior or simple trendy bad judgment.\" larrat believes that as many as 90 percent of all modifications are carried out with a negative motivation.changing your body simply to shock people, he says, or to make oneself \"freakishly unique\" strongly suggests that the individual has problems that need to be addressed before any level of physical change can be safely attempted.while larrat feels he is educating people on smart, safe, sane ways to alter themselves, his critics suggest he is providing information that could cause some to make unpleasant, unhealthy, and irreversible changes in their bodies.\"i really admire what shannon has done with bme,\" jade said. \"but i also worry that some of the information he presents might encourage people to do things that a more seasoned professional body modification artist would never attempt.\"but to larrat, the most important thing about bme is not the nuts and bolts information it provides, but the fact that his web site is the focus for a new fellowship.\"bme has managed to bring a large number of dislocated and alienated individuals together into a relatively coherent community,\" he said. \"it lets people know that what they're doing is ok, that it might just not be insanity. it lets them know they are not alone.\""}
