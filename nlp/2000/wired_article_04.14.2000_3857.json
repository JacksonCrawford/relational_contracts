york -- waves of selling swamped u.s. stocks friday as news that inflation raced at its highest speed in more than five years shattered a fragile market, capping one of the most dramatic one-week slides in history. wall street's three major stock indices logged their biggest one-day point declines in history as nearly every sector was ambushed in heavy selling that intensified in the final minutes of trading.cash tumbled out of top technology, computer-chip makers, financials, retailers, and manufacturers in a slide that left trading floors with only sell orders.traders were dumbfounded as sell orders flooded the system, saying they couldn't even look at their own portfolios.\"it's too painful to look today,\" one trader said from the floor of the new york stock exchange.\"today gave back the final bit of frenzy that started last october and broke the back of the complacent investor,\" said scott bleier, chief investment strategist at prime charter ltd.\"those wishing to sell ranged from the day trader type all the way up to the money manager guy,\" he said. \"momentum in this market runs both ways and momentum tends to overshoot both ways. and we're seeing that.\"the dow jones industrial average lost a record 617.78 points, or 5.66 percent to 10,305.77 as financial stocks erased all their recent gains, joining technology leaders to drive the blue-chip gauge further into the red for the year.american express (axp) was pummeled 12-9/16 to 133-7/16, while j.p. morgan (jpm) slid 9-1/2 to 122. investors sliced more than 10 points off intel (intc), leaving the stock at 110-1/2.weakness in leading tech names sent the nasdaq composite index plunging to finish down 9.67 percent, or 355.51 points to 3,321.27 -- a level not seen since november. the gauge also logged its biggest one-day point drop. it has fallen 34.2 percent from its march 10 high of 5,048.62 and is down 18.4 percent for the year.broader market measures were also battered. the standard & poor's 500 index fell 5.78 percent, or 83.20 points to 1,357.31. the wilshire 5000 dropped 6.45 percent, or 860.30 points to 12,475.14.investors were stunned and hushed, crowding around outdoors stock monitors in new york all day.\"up until now, when the market pulled back, it was on an earnings disappointment by a major player or on some bearish comments from federal reserve chairman alan greenspan,\" said charles payne, head analyst at independent research firm wall street strategies.\"today's (news on inflation) was the first real evidence that inflation may be creeping into the picture. the market was already vulnerable,\" he said.clearly stoking the selloff was a labor department report that the cpi rose 0.7 percent in march, surpassing the 0.5 percent expected by economists polled by reuters. the core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy, rose by 0.4 percent -- or by double the expected amount -- marking its biggest gain in more than five years.the cpi figures heightened fears the federal reserve will boost short-term interest rates more aggressively when its policy-setting panel meets on may 16. the central bank has jacked up short-term rates five times -- by 25 basis points each time -- since last june in an effort to slow the booming economy.that only exasperated a month-long pullback in technology and a more recent drop in other sectors. what's more, market watchers said they saw more downside ahead, while technical analysts scrambled to pinpoint a bottom.\"i suspect a lot further on the downside,\" said alan newman, technical analyst at h.d. brous & co. \"over the short term, i would expect some kind of bottom next week. we just cannot keep on going down at the same rate every day.\"margin calls compounded the basic selling momentum, analysts said, as officials demanded that customers deposit enough cash in their accounts to meet minimum requirements.the new york stock exchange said margin debt was at a record $278.530 billion in march, up from an old high of $265.210 billion in february.\"i wouldn't even try to figure out how low it could go,\" said larry rice, chief investment officer at josephthal lyon & ross. \"the market got carried away to the extreme on the upside and now it is going to get carried away to the extreme on the downside.\"computer-chip stocks tumbled and the philadelphia stock exchange's semiconductor index dropped 11.64 percent to 892.16. the exchange's bank index fell 7.09 percent to 752.20.even reports of strong earnings were ignored, as shares of sun microsystems lost their gain, closing down 1-1/4 at 76-1/2, after beating wall street's profit targets.among the standard & poor's 500 stocks, only 11 were winners. four of those were gold companies as investors scrambled to find a safe haven. the s&p gold index gained 7.43 percent to 114.18.the bond market moved higher, with the 30-year u.s. treasury bond up 4/32, pushing the yield down to 5.79 percent from thursday's close of 5.80 percent."}
