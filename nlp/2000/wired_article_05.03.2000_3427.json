with a new leader and backing from one of the world's largest grocery holding companies. but judging by the company's latest financial results, peapod still faces a strenuous uphill battle in its struggle for profitablility.on tuesday, the company said it appointed marc van gelder, former vice president of logistics at the stop & shop supermarket company, as its new president and ceo.the appointment capped a tumultuous month for peapod, an early entrant in the web grocery business whose recent financial difficulties have made the company a hard sell with the investing public.on wednesday, the company reported quarterly earnings slightly below wall street expectations. the company said its first-quarter net loss reached $12.7 million up from a loss of $5 million in the same period last year. at the same time, with net sales jumped 38 percent to $24.9 million from $18 million last year.peapod incurred extraordinary expenses of $4.1 million related to severance arrangements, investment transaction costs and other one-time events. stripping out those items, the first-quarter loss came in at $8.6 million, or 47 cents a share.analysts had expected a loss of 46 cents a share, according to first call/thomson financial, which tracks such estimates.still, it's the picture isn't quite as bleak as it was a month ago.as recently as april, peapod (ppod) was perched on the brink of collapse. the abrupt departure of then-ceo william malloy, who resigned for health reasons in mid-march, prompted venture capitalists to pull out of a previously announced $120 million round of financing. the pullout left peapod practically out of cash. the company warned shareholders that it could be forced to close or sell its assets.the picture brightened about two weeks ago, when grocery holding company royal ahold, which owns stop and shop and a host of other supermarket assets, invested $73 million in peapod in exchange for a 52 percent stake in the online grocer.now, with a fresh infusion of cash and a direct connection to several u.s. supermarket chains, peapod's new ceo wants to revamp the struggling business, with a plan to be worked out in detail over the next three months.the focus, van gelder said, will be on cutting operating costs by using ahold's supply chains, space, and bulk-ordering capabilities to turn peapod into a more efficient business.\"if you look at the pure internet plays in grocery delivery, it's a tough story,\" van gelder said. linking up a grocery chain with a net delivery service, however, \"gives you a good foundation for a profitable company,\" he said.such link-ups between net businesses and established retailers appear to be gaining popularity in the grocery business, which is characterized by intense competition and low profit margins.last month, supermarket mega-chain safeway agreed to invest $30 million in groceryworks.com, an upstart online grocery delivery service.in 1993, safeway partnered with peapod, but that program proved too expensive for the traditional grocer and was discontinued.in peapod's case, van gelder said he will try to make use of backroom space at grocery stores to stock products for peapod. the company currently has six such distribution centers, and hopes to expand existing ones and add new ones.drawing on expertise from established supermarket chains and simplifying its supply chain are both smart moves for peapod, said phil terry, ceo of creative good, an internet consulting firm that has worked with online food businesses.but terry mentioned another big issue that businesses like peapod have to contend with: making sites where people actually feel comfortable buying things.although peapod, webvan, and a number of net delivery companies have done a good job making themselves known to potential customers -- largely through advertising -- they haven't been able to turn name-recognition into sales. many customers come to sites to buy, but have difficulty navigating and actually placing an order.\"unfortunately they're like the rest of the internet world, where in the last few years there's been too much hype on marketing and technology and not enough focus on the basics of merchandising and selling,\" terry said. \"now they need to focus on these basics.\"for now, industry followers are waiting to see whether peapod's revamped strategy will eventually allow it to achieve what few online grocery business have: a profit. van gelder says that should happen in the next three years.forrester analyst evie black dykema blamed peapod's troubles earlier this year on several factors, including the fact the 10-year-old company may have entered the market too early, overspending before customers were ready to buy its services. she said the lack of a centralized distribution system also didn't help.dykema believes the online home-delivery business eventually could develop into a $20 billion market. however, it's a virtual certainty that not all the players around today will survive and flourish -- particularly given the vast variety of businesses vying for a piece of the market.peapod, for its part, faces substantial competition from a number of companies, each with a different angle on how the delivery business should be run.webvan, for example, is spending huge sums to build superautomated warehouses in urban centers to serve its fleet of delivery trucks. shoplink.com, which specializes in perishable foods, got $37 million in funding earlier this year for a delivery service targeted to suburban america. netgrocer ships products via federal express. meanwhile, upstart homeruns.com is expanding grocery delivery in the boston area.needless to say, not a lot of companies are eking out any profits.\"although there are some companies that are doing a little bit better than others, we believe there are no leaders right now,\" terry said. \"everyone's making a lot of the same basic mistakes.\"(reuters contributed to
