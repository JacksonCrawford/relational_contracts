chromosomes -- another volley in the public v. private challenge to fully sequence the human genome. by kristen philipkoski.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "science", "type": "article", "timestamp": "04.17.2000 03:00 AM", "text": "the publicly funded human genome project has completed mapping three chromosomes that play an important role in several major diseases -- and bolstered its claims to a more thorough mapping of the human genome than the efforts of celera, a private company that recently announced it had finished sequencing the entire genome. by completing maps of chromosome 5, 16, and 19 last week, the joint genome institute in walnut creek, california, completed its portion of the first draft of the human genome map. the chromosomes are significant in the development of diseases such as schizophrenia, diabetes, various cancers, and hypertension.even though it's a first draft, the information can already be useful to researchers trying to find the secrets behind disease, said trevor hawkins, the director of sequencing programs and the deputy director of the department of energy joint genome institute.\"if you're a biologist looking for particular genes, you are going to be able to find your genes of interest within the data being produced already. that's why it's so interesting -- 99 percent of the data is now out there,\" hawkins said.researchers discovered during the mapping process that the three chromosomes were associated with the diseases.\"it's been a learning phase, that's the beauty of this research,\" hawkins said. as we keep going, we learn more and more information and that's what makes it so exciting. it's a pandora's box.\"hawkins, known as the \"king of automation,\" worked to design automation tools responsible for helping the genome researchers finish two months ahead of schedule, achieving what hawkins called a \"massive increase in throughput\" -- producing information at 10 times the rate previous to incorporating automation nine months ago.\"we didn't get any new money, space, or people, (but achieved) month-by-month increases in efficiency,\" he said. \"we have worked very hard on automated equipment and a production line using statistical methods to track our process.\"celera genomics, the private company that began operations in 1998 and portrayed as pitted in a race against the publicly funded human genome project, announced it would finish a map in two years. earlier this month, the company said it had completed the sequencing phase of the entire genome, including all 23 chromosomes.but hawkins said that his project is one step ahead of celera's because his map of the three chromosomes is assembled, whereas celera's is not. celera said it will assemble its map -- a process similar to putting together the pieces of a puzzle -- over the next several weeks.also, the three chromosomes have been mapped six times over, while celera's sequencing effort has only repeated the effort (which is done for accuracy) three times.the berkeley lab also used a different approach to map the chromosomes, which hawkins said can be more complicated and expensive, but also more precise. he also said his lab has figured out ways to bring the cost down to be on par with most other techniques.\"the joint genome institute is the only site focused 100 percent on doing this,\" hawkins said. \"it's a subtle but critical difference because (the method) allows you to really figure out and trust the data set you're looking at.celera's claim to have sequenced the genome has been refuted by francis collins, the director of the human genome project.although both celera and the human genome project deny that they are racing to finish the map, collins and craig venter, chief scientific officer of celera, have publicly exchanged harsh words, mostly revolving around the use of the genome information.celera has been accused of wanting to keep the information private and make money from it, although the company has since vowed to publish its results when the map is complete. the public effort posts its data on a searchable web site every 24 hours.this free information gives celera the obvious advantage of being able to use and compare it to its own.\"i don't really believe there is a competition,\" hawkins said. \"it's very much a collaborative effort -- as craig venter has often said, they use our data. they take if off the ftp site just like everyone else does.\"before joining the joint genome institute, hawkins, who said \"sequencing is in my blood,\" was vice president of genomics for two years at curagen in new haven, connecticut.\"i've worked on the other side of the fence, i know exactly what goes on,\" hawkins said.despite the contention, celera has also been credited for speeding up what began as an arduous and expensive 15-year project. while some government researchers have maintained it was simply the availability of better technology that allowed the public consortium to tighten its deadline from 2005 to having a finished draft by this year, others say celera's challenge to finish first made the hgp scramble.\"i think that what they have achieved is a great step forward,\" hawkins said. \"i think it really has inspired us and inspired a lot of other people to take their lead and scale up and think bigger and believe that the genome can actually be sequenced faster, cheaper, and better.\"celera did not return phone calls requesting comment.researchers hope to use the human genome map, a road map of the estimated 140,000 genes in the human body, as a starting point for discovering disease treatments and diagnostic tools.rivalries exist within the various government labs working on the publicly funded project, albeit a bit more friendly.\"we all like to do a good job and like to be recognized so there certainly is competition ... but we try not to let it be destructive,\" said bob waterston, director of the gene sequencing center at the washington university school of medicine in st. louis, missouri.waterston commended the berkeley lab's efforts, and said the accomplishment is the first of many soon to come in the public sector.\"i think it's another step along the way and it helps substantiate that the whole public effort is closing in on the goal for completing a working draft on all the chromosomes,\" waterston said."}
