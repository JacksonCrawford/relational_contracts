companies with faltering stocks or insufficient assets. dotcoms are beginning to be among the casualties. by joanna glasner.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "08.21.2000 03:00 AM", "text": "times were tough enough for efax.com when it was still trading on the nasdaq exchange. the company's stock, worth more than $13 a share in december, was trading in the sub-dollar range by mid-summer. the fax-to-email service provider's quarterly revenue fell by 25 percent from a year ago. meanwhile, losses continued.the final straw came last friday, when the nasdaq exchange removed efax (efax) from its listings, saying it had failed to meet financial requirements to continue trading there. the company moved to the lower-profile over the counter (otc) exchange, where executives have remained reasonably upbeat about the stock's performance.\"its only impact has been the price has been reduced,\" said todd j. kenck, efax's chief financial officer.in the last week, the stock has dipped from 41 cents to 32 cents a share. trading volume hasn't changed much since the delisting, he said.efax is one of several firms forced to leave the nasdaq -- the fast-growing exchange where the majority of the most prominent u.s. internet and technology companies trade -- this month. others include outsource international, a personnel services provider, and u.s. diagnostics, an operator of diagnostic imaging centers.a much longer list of companies that have recently fallen out of step with listing requirements are still trading on the nasdaq. their ranks include a number of internet and technology firms that began trading on the exchange at the height of dotcom stock market mania, but have since seen share prices plummet and profits fail to materialize.\"the interesting thing with the internet companies is there aren't a whole lot that have a significant amount of income right now, so it's possible they could fall under the listing requirements,\" said stuart bressman, a partner at the law firm brown raysman, who specializes in corporate finance.companies get delisted from nasdaq for a variety of reasons, including failure to maintain a minimum level of corporate assets or fpr accounting violations. in addition, if a company's shares fall below a dollar for more than 30 days straight and don't recover within a set time frame, nasdaq officials will remove the stock from the exchange.no one gets booted from the exchange without extensive advance warning. typically, exchange officials notify a company soon after it falls out of compliance, and give executives several weeks to put their financial house in order.\"my experience is nasdaq doesn't jump all over you when things turn down. they give you some time to recover and meet the listing requirements,\" bressman said.when that doesn't happen, nasdaq officials move to delist companies in order to maintain the integrity of the exchange.nasdaq officials didn't disclose how many companies have received warning letters threatening them with the possibility of being taken off the exchange. bressman believes many companies won't receive warnings until next year, after they submit their annual earnings reports.still, the early indication is that things are not shaping up well for a number of once sought-after companies currently trading on nasdaq.among the list of dotcoms in trouble are e-commerce firms pets.com (ipet) and beyond.com (bynd), and beleaguered health care website drkoop.com (koop).nasdaq also halted trading of bankrupt online retailer value america (vusaq) last friday, saying trading will not resume until the company provides more complete information about its financial situation. shares of the company are currently worth just 72 cents.a large percentage of companies that get booted off nasdaq wind up trading on the otc bulletin board -- a decentralized market for securities not listed on a stock exchange. when that happens, a company can expect a lower trading volume than is typical on nasdaq and less attention from institutional investors and banks who track publicly traded firms.however, although delisting can be a tough blow for already struggling companies, it's far from the end of the road. they can re-apply for a nasdaq listing once their financial situation improves.in efax's case, kenck said the company isn't planning to apply for a new listing because it has agreed to be acquired by a competitor, jfax (jfax), which is already traded on nasdaq.even without pending acquisitions, many companies have seen share prices rise briskly on the otc exchange.still, if the continuing mad rush of pre-ipo companies planning debuts on nasdaq is any indication, being excluded from the most prominent marketplace isn't exactly a positive development, according to bressman:\"it doesn't mean a company can't recover, but it's not heading in the right direction.\""}
