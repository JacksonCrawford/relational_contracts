amazed that these highly technical academics ever birthed something so fun and easy to use. the protocol wonks of the world wide web consortium get impassioned debating the merits of transport layers and the relative benefits of \"xml-rpc versus soap.\" how could they have begotten the hamster dance and the mahir phenomenon?the people who build and maintain the technology that moves data around the world this week are jousting over how to take the web wireless at the world wide web meeting. although they\u2019re still discussing old favorites like hypertext, xml, and convergence, wireless dominates many conversations.the imminent arrival of several hundred million wireless application protocol (wap)-enabled phones -- 525 million by 2003, according to strategy analytics -- is forcing the w3c to figure out how to deal with all these web users who can\u2019t sit still long enough to use a tethered computer.the idea of being able to access all information, anywhere, anytime, was part of the original vision of the web as defined by its creator (and w3c director) tim berners-lee. but as often happens, a group of impatient companies has independently grabbed the ball and is running with it -\u2013 forcing the w3c to figure out how to play with them.software company phone.com and the wap forum it co-founded, along with several handset manufacturers (motorola, nokia, ericsson), has defined its own rules for displaying web content on wireless phones, using wap and the wireless markup language (wml).on its brochure web pages, the wap forum says it\u2019s working closely with the w3c, but it was clear that some in the w3c resent the company plowing ahead with its own new rules, and not waiting on the w3c\u2019s more ponderous process.some web standards diehards are convinced that xml and its html variant, xhtml, are all you need to display content on mobile devices, so the fact that phone.com is going ahead with wml ruffles some feathers. but the w3c is starting to come on board with wap, and now says on its website that wap is on the path to becoming a recommendation.having a company or small contingency strike out and promote its own technology as a standard is nothing new for the w3c. developers will remember that microsoft and netscape ruffled feathers by creating their own markup tags that they said users were hungry for, things like the infamous blink tag.\"where is netscape today?\" boomed one indignant w3c member, murray maloney, at a wap panel wednesday morning. \"it\u2019s a part of aol, and it doesn\u2019t have that kind of control anymore.... the people who are working on wap need to get with the program.\"bruce martin, a phone.com representative who played the role of the black hat on the panel, professed allegiance to the w3c and its processes. but his company is out ahead dealing with new issues, and like netscape and microsoft before it, is unlikely to wait when customers are eager to buy.but designing user-friendly interfaces does not seem to be a primary concern for many of the meetings' participants.in addition to defending phone.com, martin reminded the audience that mobile users have different needs. \"it\u2019s not just that the interface is different,\" he said. \"it\u2019s that people use it differently. the user tends to be very focused on a specific task.\"at wednesday\u2019s wap panel, when the conversation drifted too deeply into a discussion of transport layer protocols, one panel member from ericsson, johan hjelm, tried to get the group back on track. \"the important thing isn\u2019t what carrier type you use, the important thing is the user experience.\"it was a dead giveaway of the audience\u2019s sympathies that in an crowd of 1,000 people, only one pair of hands applauded his jibe.martin\u2019s colleague don schuerholz, the manager of the developer program at phone.com, told the audience at another session that too many people are trying to port their web pages and services to phone handsets, without considering the user. \"think about the value of your application for someone in a mobile computing environment.\"that kind of thinking is leading to the return of interest in push technology. push had its heyday as a buzzword in 1996, and schuerholz is convinced it will be back with wap phones. the small screens and limited memory are much better suited to receive chunks of requested information, he said, including things like sports scores and the oft-cited stock quotes.other presentations showed that some academics pay attention to the differences of mobile users and desktop users. a team from stanford university\u2019s digital libraries technologies group, for example, showed off a power browser designed for the palm operating system. it featured more controlled search capabilities, helping with shortcuts and limiting results to a number manageable for a small screen."}
