(note: as of tuesday march 28, the site was unavailable, following the appearance of a message from lowry saying traffic overload at his web hosting service forced him to temporarily remove the posters and stickers offered for download. lowry was hopeful the site would return later in the week after a new hosting site is found.)with a visit to the website, some avery sticker labels and a laser printer, anyone could plaster his neighborhood with dot-commentary in a matter of minutes.\"penisenlargementgiftcertificates.com.\" \"beatoffpicturesgalore.com.\"it's hard to miss the emphasis on sexual and scatological themes, most of which lean heavily toward the obscene. lowry says the message needs to be shocking, to be heard over the rest of the dot-com din.\"there's so many [dot-com ads] out there that unless it's completely obscene, and gets someone to do a pretty solid double-take, they'll just think that it's another dot-com advertiser.\"he hopes the campaign will get people to think about what they're doing -- and would-be dot-commers to think twice before believing all the hype.\"people are working ridiculous hours. you hear stories about someone, you know, who made $25 million and doesn't have to work anymore. everyone's kind of working towards that ideal, or they think they want to. [meanwhile] no one can get an apartment because they cost way too much, and some 23-year-old already paid cash for it.\"some of the poster slogans target the business models of hit net companies like home-delivery service kozmo.com -- \"freeanalpastedeliveredinanhour.com\" -- and auction site ebay -- \"bidonmycollectionofrawfeces.com.\"the most popular campaign, according to lowry, had a simple, pointed message to it: \"fuckyouandthestartupyourodeinon.com.\"\"that seems to sort of characterize the angst,\" lowry said.asked to comment on being caught in the satirical crossfire, kozmo representatives took a look at the website, and decided to decline. ebay acknowledged its amusement, then excused itself from the fray.ebay spokesman kevin pursglove said the company laughed itself \"silly-dot-com,\" when he and others at the company gathered around the campaign's website for a look-see. \"we got a chuckle.com out of it,\" he said. \"we appreciate a good laugh.\"pursglove attributes the backlash reaction to dot-com over-promotion -- on radio, tv, billboards, and the sides of buses and taxi cabs. \"clearly there's sort of a suggestion here that there's a revolt against dot-com advertisers -- but ebay doesn't advertise,\" pursglove said. \"and it's interesting that we still have that level of penetration in the public psyche.\"lowry said the reaction to the campaign has been overwhelmingly positive, and not just confined to san francisco. \"i get like 50 emails a day from people, all over the world, going, 'thank god you did this;' 'we've been meaning to say this;' 'this is exactly what it's all about,'\" lowry said.once confined to the bay area, lowry said he has found takers for the stickers and posters in new york, chicago, philadelphia, and even london. remote sympathizers can download pdf files to make their own posters.but san francisco remains the epicenter of the dot-com phenomenon or, if you prefer, cancer.tim redmond, executive editor of the san francisco bay guardian, which runs its own \"take back san francisco\" campaign on billboards and news racks, says the dot-com images are blitzing the city. \"i know this because we were talking about our next promotional campaign. you cannot rent a billboard in san francisco right now. you can't get bus sides, because there's so much [web company] advertising.\"but most of the grassroots support probably springs from the pressure created by the dot-com economic boom in san francisco, where rents, as well as advertising rates, are soaring. meanwhile, not everyone's boat is being lifted by the dot-com tide.\"it's dot-com land and there are billboards everywhere and there are millionaires being created every day -- and there are more homeless people than ever in the streets of san francisco,\" redmond said. \"there's something very wrong with this picture.\"inevitably, some have seen a capital idea in lowry's campaign. he said he's received invites to dot-com opening parties, and plenty of people think the whole thing is just another dot-com business in the wind. some want him to do a t-shirt deal.\"everyone who sees it who understands all this, they're like, 'yeah, of course.' and then everyone else is like, 'shoot, why didn't i think of beatoffpicturesgalore.com?' i heard a story where the person [reacting to one of the posters] couldn't believe that that company got funding. the whole thing just went right over their head.\"is his message doing more than making people laugh? what's the end game?\"if it could just take a little bit of the edge off of how cool dot-com's are, then i think it would be kind of successful. if someone who was on the edge said, 'you know what? maybe it's not so cool to go get a job for cleanyourunderwear.com,' i would consider that a marginal success right there.\""}
