dot-com riches that have brought good fortune to their neighbors could force them to change their profession or zip code.the couple, who just had a baby, have a roommate in the house that they rent from heidi's mother.\"we're both professionals,\" said heidi, a physical education teacher at peterson middle school in sunnyvale. \"but unless you're in the computer industry, you can't (afford) a house.\"\"it's depressing,\" agreed dave, who has a master's degree and teaches spanish at santa clara high school. \"we put in our time and effort and we still can't afford a house in the area we grew up in.\"i don't see myself in teaching for too long because it's just not affordable,\" he added.soaring real estate prices in silicon valley, which is rapidly becoming one of the most expensive areas of the country to live, are posing problems for teacher recruitment and forcing some veteran teachers to leave their homes and seek employment in more affordable areas.teachers earn a beginning salary of about $36,000 in the valley, where the median price tag for a house is $535,000.now several technology companies that helped inflate the housing market have stepped in to help.earlier this month, hewlett-packard donated $1 million to the housing trust of santa clara county that will be earmarked specifically for teachers. the fund, which was established last year, awards grants or loans for down payments, or low-interest mortgage loans.teachers would pay back the loan at a 2-percent rate, rather than the usual 7 or 8 percent.\"with housing prices climbing so high, hp wants to help enable teachers to stay in this area and buy homes in the nation's most expensive housing market,\" said bess stephens, director of education relations and philanthropy at hewlett-packard.receiving a grant \"makes a significant difference on a monthly payment,\" said paul wysocki, the interim project director for the trust, which is devoted to assisting first-time home buyers and building affordable apartments and transitional housing. \"it might make a difference between buying a house and not buying a house.\"applications will be made available to teachers in the fall, and grants and loans will be awarded sometime next year. the fund will help roughly 240 teachers, though wysocki admits \"i'm sure we'll have far more (requests) than we can accommodate.\"the money is welcome news to school administrators who have had a tough time finding teachers.\"we're excited about it because we're having trouble recruiting new teachers to our district -- and it's not just our district, it's the entire area,\" said dan vinson, assistant superintendent of the a mountain view school district.vinson said one-bedroom apartments in mountain view cost between $1,000 and $1,500 a month to rent.according to the silicon valley manufacturing group, almost 50 percent of new teachers leave silicon valley within four years of being hired. teachers usually move to san diego, sacramento, or california's central valley, where the cost of living is more reasonable, vinson said.in addition to the hp grant, the mountain view administrator is pleased that certain apartment buildings have agreed to waive a portion of their up-front fees for tenants who have teaching credentials or contracts.other school districts in silicon valley are pursuing creative measures to find housing for teachers.after losing 35 teachers this year and 25 the year before -- specifically because of the housing issue -- the santa clara county unified school district has several new initiatives in place to help teachers find homes.the district is building a 40-unit apartment complex for teachers that will rent for 50 percent below market rate. the building will open in the fall of 2001.\"we've got a teacher who is renting a living room for $600 per month. we've got four teachers who are sharing a two-bedroom apartment,\" said roger barnes, the director of education partnerships for the district. \"we're going to easily fill up the 40 apartments.\"while the apartments are tailored for young teachers who rent, the district also has a partnership with intel to help teachers buy homes in the valley.intel \"bought a $10 million bond from us at 4 percent and we'll repay the bond in five years,\" barnes said. the district re-invested the money at 7.36 percent. with the money earned from the difference in the two interest rates, the district will buy equity shares in the teacher homes.this arrangement enables teachers to buy houses that they could not afford on their salary alone. after five years, the teacher -- who, in theory, will be making more money at that time -- will be able to pay that money back to the district, which will fund more homes for future teachers.\"intel's investment has allowed us to help teachers basically forever, because the money renews itself,\" barnes said.the first loans will be granted by a lottery system. the llamases are relying on help like this.\"if we don't get the lottery this year, we're probably not going to stay,\" heidi llamas said.the san francisco unified school district is facing similar problems as living costs there escalate due to the influx of dot-com companies. in an effort to help teachers, the school board recently passed the teacher housing initiative, a plan to build apartments on school land that would serve as subsidized housing for teachers.but the idea infuriates some teachers.\"it's insulting,\" said susie siegel, a kindergarten teacher at yick wo elementary school, who has taught for nine years. \"i think that while the intention is good, i think it's terrible that it has come to this.\"if we were adequately compensated like any other professional, we could live anywhere we want in the city,\" she said.she said the plan amounts to placing teachers in dorms, and the location of the apartments -- on the site of the future dianne feinstein elementary school -- would be \"like living at school.\"the proposal emphasizes the universal problem that teachers are grossly underpaid, said mark sanchez, a former fourth grade teacher at paul revere elementary school, who is running for school board. \"we're in such bad shape that we have to resort to public housing.\"nevertheless, both agree that something must be done.\"none of those drawbacks are as big as the drawbacks that teachers are facing right now -- which is that they can't afford to live in san francisco without sharing bedrooms, or else commuting 30, 40, or 50 miles,\" said dan kelly, who has served on the school board for 10 years.\"the model of employer-sponsored housing in high-rent cities is well-established,\" kelly said.other cities have had great success with it, he said. hospitals in new york, for example, own housing for their nurses.for now, teachers, administrators, and the companies that want to help them will watch and see what happens.\"if things go well, we expect that we'll be going back and starting another fund-raising campaign,\" wysocki said. \"we want to build on a feasible success first.\"and wysocki said that the housing trust has received calls from other districts that hope to set up similar programs.in the meantime, vinson said, the mountain view district will continue to look for other ways to help teachers because \"we want to recruit great ones and keep the good ones we have.\""}
