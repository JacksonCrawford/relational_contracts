please send an e-mail to sourceinfo[at]wired.com.a hacker didn't need keys to access the private information that was supposed to be securely stored on zkey's award-winning information storage portal. all he needed was a little javascript.a new security hole, discovered aug. 14 by a hacker who calls himself \"blue adept,\" allows zkey users on internet explorer 5.5 with a zkey account to easily steal the user names and passwords of other zkey users simply by sending an email that includes a specific javascript code embedded in the body of the message.once a malicious user knows the username/password of the victim's zkey account, they have full control of the account \u2013- and access to stored files, calendar, contact lists, and email from both zkey and any email accounts the user has linked to their zkey page.blue adept made the code available to wired news for testing. his claims were checked by pasting the code into self-addressed emails that were then sent through the zkey systems. once the emails were opened, the script then sent private account information directly to the server at hacker site becausewecan, and, within minutes, blue adept was able to reveal testers' user names and passwords.zkey provides free, secure socket layer (ssl) protected file storage space (\"z-drive\"), collaboration utilities, contacts, calendaring, and web-based email, and bills itself as a safe and private repository for personal information.it is popular among mobile users, and once received an editor's choice award from zd. zkey officials say they have about 300,000 registered users.the hacking code, along with blue adept's notes about its development, can be viewed here.\"it would be trivial for someone to rework my code and use it to access zkey user info,\" blue adept said. \"making it work on a browser other than ie 5.5 might be a bit tricky -- but far from impossible.\"blue adept specifically asked wired news not to publish this story until thursday, so that the company would have time to patch the hole before he made details of the crack public. he did not access any of zkey's user accounts, and the hole has been plugged.blue adept says that he attempted to inform zkey of the hole by emailing the company several times on august 14. he received no reply.when contacted thursday morning, zkey vice president darren jordan wrote in an email, \"as of right now, there is no documented security breach nor can we re-produce this alleged security hole.\"a later email from zkey's company president, jay udani, did confirm the hole and said that the problem had been resolved.\"the issue was a classic trojan-horse measure in which the security of the zkey site and zkey database were never compromised,\" udani said. \"this particular script, which worked sporadically at best, and only under very specific browser and operating system conditions, merely tricked users into entering their own username and password into a false user session login.\"again, explicit cooperation was required from the user, and at no time was data taken from the zkey database.\"andrew antipass, a manhattan-based security consultant, disagrees with udani's comments about the limited nature of the hack.\"this 'explicit cooperation' he refers to actually was very subtle. what happened was when the script ran, it appeared to the user as if he or she had been disconnected from the service and was being asked to log on,\" antipass said. \"it was extremely, if not impossibly, difficult to tell that there was any outside interference. zkey should be thankful that blue adept is one of the good guys.\"blue adept notes that cracking zkey presented some interesting challenges.\"first, the site is ssl'd -- served off a secure socket layer (medium-grade encryption key rc4-40), which encrypts data in transit and also restricts the kinds of cross-site scripting techniques that can be used without alerting the user to suspicious activity. secondly, the email service itself has filters in place to strip out malicious code from the body of email messages. but both security measures were surmountable.\"but he says he didn't specifically set out to crack z-key.\"i have no control over who has security holes, i just report them when i find them.\"blue adept says cracking zkey's security was \"fun \u2013- it only took about a day,\" but is quick to point out that he doesn't think that zkey is a \"villain.\"\"they overlooked some security issues in their email service,\" he said. \"sure, they could have gotten back to me sooner and not waited ... but it's a common situation that web-based companies don't focus on security as much as marketing.\"blue adept also noted that his hack of zkey highlights the fact that ssl-servers alone are not enough to prevent cross-site script attacks. this issue is relevant to many other web-based service providers.he pointed out that, when testing the hack, a user will notice that the site does generate a dialog box warning that the page includes insecure elements and asking if the user wants to display them. but even if you select \"no,\" the crack still works.\"let's face it, there's nothing such as a 100 percent secure system,\" says blue adept, \"so generally, companies allocate their resources in other directions (like growth). the real responsibility of a company is to face the music and fix the problem when a security hole is revealed, and i'm confident now that zkey will look into it.\""}
