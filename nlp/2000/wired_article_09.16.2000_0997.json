the web. are these heavyweights really luddites? by robin clewley.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "business", "type": "article", "timestamp": "09.16.2000 03:00 AM", "text": "interested in reading the latest article online from  talk magazine? how about vanity fair? what about that one article that came out a few months back in the new yorker?don't even think about looking for these articles using the web. they don't exist. you'll have to head to your local library and thumb through the old card catalogue.these are just three of the magazines on newsstands today that do not have content-oriented websites. in an age when people are becoming more and more tech-savvy, these publications are placing their bets that readers will be content to go to their local bodega for their latest literary or high-society gossip fix.but why not supplement offline magazines with content-rich sites?\"we feel the internet is still relatively new, and we as a company are being careful as to how we want to deal with it,\" said maurie perl, senior vice president of corporate communications of cond\u00e9 nast, the parent company of vanity fair and the new yorker.\"right now we view it as more of a business opportunity than an editorial opportunity,\" she said.this attitude becomes clear when visiting the websites of talk, vanity fair and the new yorker. these marketing-oriented websites tease the reader -- saying, in so many words, that if they want the content, they should subscribe or buy the latest issue.officials at all three publications had little or nothing to say about the issue.vanity fair didn't return repeated phone calls from wired news, and the new yorker spokeswoman perri dorset declined to comment.talk spokeswoman hilary bass said only that an \"editorial site is in the works,\" but refused further comment.some publishers and industry observers say that not having a content-based website in conjunction with an offline publication is shortsighted -- and loses a significant portion of a publisher's potential audience.elle magazine's site creates 80 percent of its content separate from the newsstand publication. elle.com complements the magazine with original articles, and interactive features.karen verlander, creative director of elle.com, said it's valuable to have an online and offline presence to speak to a larger audience. the magazine-website combination strengthens the overall brand, she said.\"today there is a generation of young people, both men and women, who think of the internet as their medium,\" verlander said. \"in all likelihood, a younger age group will immediately tap into the internet to see if that information is there from those particular magazine names. if i was doing research, i would see if vanity fair was online.\"andrew ross, executive vice president of salon.com, said some magazines believe they will lose money by publishing their printed matter online. free online content, they believe, will hurt magazine subscription and newsstand rates.\"in the age of the internet, (publishing) month-to-month has to be somewhat frustrating,\" he said. \"but it would make sense for the magazines to use the internet to extend the experience -- to build communities.\"malcolm gladwell, a staff writer for the new yorker, has built his own community by posting his own articles. his site went up january 2000 and receives 5,000 to 6,000 hits a day, he said.\"there's a huge demand for the new yorker online,\" gladwell said. \"everywhere i go, people ask me that question.\"gladwell said archives of the new yorker do not exist in any sort of computerized format, which is why he put up his website. he has tried to convince his fellow staff writers to create their own sites, but thinks he's the only one.\"maybe i'm the only one with the ego large enough to have my stories live on,\" he laughed.when asked why he thinks the new yorker still remains offline, he said, \"god knows. but it does seem a little late in the day.\"roland de wolk, who began an online journalism curriculum at san francisco state university, said he thinks publications such as the new yorker are staying away from the web because of the fear of revenue loss. he also pointed to what he views as a lack of online-trained people on the east coast, where most magazines are based.\"to launch a successful, content-rich website, it takes people with three to five years' experience,\" de wolk said. \"you're not going to find that kind of talent outside of the san francisco bay area.\"karrie jacobs recently launched an offline magazine, dwell, simultaneously with a website.jacobs, the editor-in-chief, said starting the architecture-and-design magazine and the website together was not difficult because she was hired a year before the first issue was to come out. with extra time, she had the first six months to concentrate on the website.\"when you're launching a magazine, people want something that they can see,\" she said. \"the best thing the website did, even though it was not content-rich, was give the overall attitude of what dwell is.\"since the debut of dwell this month, the website has had to change direction, and jacobs says that's been difficult. no longer is the website a marketing tool for the publisher, but an interactive and independent, albeit complementary, element to the san francisco-based magazine.\"the problem is that i have tremendous ambitions for the website,\" jacobs said. \"but personally i don't have the energy to make it all happen. so it becomes a stepchild.\"jacobs did say, however, that it is not always crucial to have a website just because you have an offline publication.\"with talk, they had so much advance publicity; everyone knew about it,\" she said. \"for us, it was really good to have a website. we were just a string of adjectives.\""}
