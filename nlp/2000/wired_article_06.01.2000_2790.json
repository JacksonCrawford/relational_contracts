and that's just one  incubateur. the post-minitel generation comes of age.the temple d'or stays open all night. the beer on tap is good, the c\u00f4tes du rh\u00f4ne is not. the beaujolais is ok, and a cup of coffee costs half what it does in other, richer parisian neighborhoods. this is a working-class place, and there wouldn't be much to distinguish it from a lot of other little caf\u00e9s in forgotten corners of france if it weren't for the hours it keeps - and the fact that, even in the dark before dawn, the smoke-filled air is thick with ideas and ambition.lila abid, the waitress whose uncle owns the temple d'or, knows all the new clients from les start-up across the street at an incubateur called republic alley, where 14 internet companies, employing 130 people, have raised about $20 million in the last year. she points to a table where half a dozen men and women are leaning in, talking so close together they could be a football huddle. the man who seems to be calling the plays is slight, with unkempt curly hair, round glasses, and a sheepskin vest that looks like it was made for a pyrenean shepherd. one of the women has brought her dog, a friendly pooch named moose (i see from his collar), who begs some roquefort off my plate.right away, the temple d'or is starting to feel like home. if there's any place in the city where you can plug into what's happening, been happening, gonna be happening, this is it.we are in northeast paris, a block from the sprawling place de la r\u00e9publique in one direction, and the canal st-martin in the other. it was just a couple of hundred yards from here that the worldly, shrill, slutty, and so very gallic actress arletty spoke those lines every french moviegoer remembers: \"atmosph\u00e8re! atmosph\u00e8re!\"this corner of paris is dense with the past, like the rest of the city, but it's also dense with the future. barges still creep through the slow-rising locks of the canal, and lovers still embrace to the sound of water cascading over iron and rivets. but down in the sewers, among cat-sized rats, technicians from colt telecom are laying miles of fiber-optic cable. les mis\u00e9rables meets the megabyte. this is the side of town where the city of light becomes the city of color. italians and russians and jews flooded in toward the end of the 19th century; algerians and moroccans, pakistanis and turks, toward the end of the 20th. you don't hear much tourist english on the streets. french is just the common language, and people smile when they speak it. at les start-up, english is as much the lingua franca as french.this is the part of paris where kings and emperors, prefects and presidents are used to seeing trouble - a collection of streets where workers used to dance to accordions and make revolutions with paving stones. it's still where they march when they want to bring down a government. and it is becoming ground zero for another kind of revolution. space is cheap where the sweatshops have shut down, and the fiber-optic backbone, built by the state to feed the needs of the nearby stock market, is strong. people who are smart and creative but who want to stay in france, in the parisian heart of it - and who wouldn't? - think this is a neighborhood where they can find refuge from the rest of the finger-wagging french and let themselves go wherever their intellect, initiative, and long workdays will take them.because they know what happened with the internet in america, they have a pretty good idea of what will happen here: it's a revolution foretold. but because it's at a relatively early stage, there's still a tremendous intimacy to france's internet insurgency. the culture, the business, the opportunities are \"exploding\" (a word almost everyone uses), but the community has not yet atomized.france's gurus are few but known to all, and jean-michel billaut, a 54-year-old analyst at the french bank bnp paribas, has been an apostle of the new economy for so long he's sometimes called e-papy - \"e-grandpa.\" in 1979, he started a forum for new business projects, especially those related to technology, that came to be called l'atelier. in 1994, after an extended visit to the united states, he brought back his enthusiasm for the internet - along with a steady stream of people to talk about it. now l'atelier may host two or three presentations a day by french and european entrepreneurs. founders of american startups often arrive from the states early in the morning, then fly out again in the evening. billaut's offices, which look out on a little clearing in the forest of steel and glass that is the bnp paribas building, are near the arc de triomphe. that's on the other side of the city, and seemingly on the other side of the world, from the temple d'or. but billaut understands the spirit there as well as anyone, and has had no small part in shaping it.as recently as the summer of 1999, billaut feared france would be an eternal also-ran in the new economy. he had seen a generation of young french engineers and entrepreneurs - 3com's eric benhamou, for instance - abandon their country to make a future in america. some 40,000 of france's best and brightest had settled in silicon valley, and french companies like software designer business objects tended to have at least as much of a presence in california as in paris. the only good news was that \"the american giants can't come here without allying themselves to 'the natives,' as they say,\" billaut told the journal du net last september.but when billaut invites me for a cigar and a shot of j&b at l'atelier one evening six months later, he is quietly effusive. i ask him about the quote. \"france has woken up since then,\" he says. \"there's something in the air.\" the fact that the country increasingly sees itself as part of the expansive, expanding european union, with open borders and a single currency, instead of as an insular bastion of gallic specialness - that's part of it. so are some of the policies of prime minister lionel jospin's government. such is the fervor that captains of france's old industries, armed with a whole lot of cash, are scrambling to make up for lost time.luxury goods tycoon bernard arnault, head of lvmh mo\u00ebt hennessy louis vuitton, set up europ@web last year with $500 million (and a tech swat team headed by 33-year-old chahram becharat) in order to buy his way into internet businesses new and old. artemis, the holding company of retailing king fran\u00e7ois-henri pinault at pinault-printemps-redoute (ppr), has also moved aggressively onto the web. jean-marie messier took hoary conglomerate compagnie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des eaux (whose core business was water distribution), focused it on communications, renamed it vivendi, and, during the vodaphone-mannesmann takeover battle, positioned it as a pivotal player in global cell phone services. serge tchuruk of alcatel went on a shopping spree, acquiring $9 billion worth of us tech firms over the past two years.but while these french equivalents of time warner-aol have gotten a lot of the media ink, billaut gives most of the credit for the change in the air to france's kids. they were fed up with the \"sclerotic\" atmosphere in paris, as he describes it, but not all of them could or would move to mountain view. \"they have a little bit of the spirit of 1968,\" says billaut - that spring when students raged in the streets, thinking they could radically change the old, uptight system. but those were times of great ideologies, billaut points out. the difference today, he says, is that the young \"don't think about how they're going to reform the system; they think, 'just do it.'\"the technological foundations they have to build on are good ones. ciaran quinn, of virtual european office (veo), which advises foreign companies looking to set up french offices or operations, likes to tell american clients that \"france is one of the most wired countries in the world.\" of france's 58.5 million people, 13 million use the minitel, the dumb terminal from the 1980s that has taught the french to seek information and shop online. two and a half million households have digital television, and the country is a leader in developing interactive tv applications. there are 17 million gsm digital phones in france, and, says quinn, more gsm users in europe - about 140 million - than there are internet users in the united states. it should be easy for france to make the transition from digital talk to digital data. as for the internet itself, the number of users has gone from fewer than 1 million to 6 million in three years and is climbing fast. investment is pouring into france's dot-coms - not least because, starting so close to zero, their growth rates are very high. according to government statistics, more venture capital was invested in forgotten france in 1998 than in cool britannia. \"in 1998, the money started,\" says orianne garcia, a 27-year-old star of france's wired world. \"in 1999, it exploded. what's really characteristic in france right now is having more money than projects worth a shot.\"britain's 3i technology, one of europe's oldest venture capital companies, has seen the flow of business plans into its paris office increase from about a dozen in february 1999 to 137 in february 2000. \"we used to move ahead to what we call wips - works in progress - on about 50 percent of them,\" says 3i's cl\u00e9ment cordier. \"now it's more like 5 percent.\" there are plenty of other vc players to take up the slack. in 1999, about 25 \"majors\" invested some $320 million in 300 companies, and those numbers could double or triple by the end of this year. money attracts money from the long-established likes of sofinnova, which was bought out by management (old-timer jean bernard schmidt, newcomer franck delorme, and others) in 1997, just in time for the boom; from the big conglomerates; and from smaller groups of angels, like the teams at chausson and leonardo. even xavier schallebaum, webmaster at the elys\u00e9e presidential palace, got into the act by joining vc group apollo invest.\"france has woken up,\" says paris' so-called e-grandpa. \"there's something in the air.\"france's business culture used to be notoriously risk-averse, and not without cause. \"before '95, there were no exit strategies for these players except to go to the nasdaq,\" says michel birnbaum of close brothers equity markets in paris. but the development in the last five years of \"new markets\" modeled on the nasdaq - france's nouveau march\u00e9, germany's neuer markt, and others - has changed that scene completely. last month, the french stock exchange added two new indexes to track technology stocks, based on the performance of companies such as tv network tf1, consultancy and smartcard-maker bull, electronics manufacturer thompson multimedia, and videogame outfit ubi soft entertainment.sensing that the new economy would be a hot issue in the 2002 presidential elections - with the most wired-looking candidate better positioned to win - french president jacques chirac paid a visit to republic alley in march. he appeared at once baffled, amused, and impressed - especially when he realized that he'd talked to people there for more than an hour and \"there was not one recrimination.\" the france that chirac knows and leads has always been one of r\u00e2leurs - bitchers and moaners - who talk obsessively about the affronts of the past. les start-up at republic alley just wanted to talk about the future.st\u00e9phane boujnah, who was the point man on new technologies for france's finance ministry until he headed for a private-sector berth at credit suisse first boston earlier this year, maps out what he sees as the developing heart of paris' new economy. \"it's an area with risk, commerce, and newcomers,\" says boujnah, \"and that's what the internet is all about.\" the bourse and the financial district are to the west, the centre pompidou and the cozy, gay marais are to the south, the canal st-martin is to the east, and the train terminals - gare du nord and gare de l'est - are to the north. what we're talking about is paris' east end, although nobody calls it that - yet. \"it's like it was in the middle ages,\" says billaut. \"you had the street of tailors, the street of butchers. now you have the street of startups.\"the future's first outpost in eastern paris was around the sentier metro station, which the french press has dubbed \"silicon sentier.\" there were about 30 embryonic internet companies operating in silicon sentier at the end of 1999. now, just a few months later, there are closer to 200 of them. even those who prefer the more flexible, efficient office spaces in the nearby paris suburbs of levallois-perret and boulogne - or in la d\u00e9fense, the architectural ghetto to which paris' skyscrapers are exiled and where microsoft and ibm have planted flags - admit that for young french entrepreneurs, the tiny maid's rooms in the roofs of eastern paris have a major mystique. \"in silicon valley, it's the garage; here, it's the chambre de bonne,\" says eric perbos-brinck, president of bravonestor.com, the levallois-based shopbot affiliated with mysimon.the east-end boom was begun by some big names, in fact. yahoo! france was one of the first to settle into this end of town: its offices, along with reuters', are in an ultramodern complex of cut stone, steel, and glass. but they're hidden from view by a blank white wall and a nondescript door at 8 rue du sentier. multimania, yahoo!'s biggest homegrown competitor in france (ranking consistently among the five most-visited sites), has its offices near the gare de l'est. nptv, which specializes in interactive television, is growing so fast it's devouring office after office in the republic alley building. a maid's room can't hold a successful startup for long, and even an atelier can get tight.orianne garcia was one of the neighborhood's first big success stories. a millionaire chemical redhead with a slightly cynical smile, garcia is one of france's two most effective internet entrepreneurs, according to the journal du net. she's also become a tv host and been celebrated in a photo spread in paris match. in 1995, garcia, with four friends and a couple of pcs, started lokace, one of the first french-language web directories. three years later, the five sold their operation to infonie (an access provider that now calls itself infosources) for about $2 million in stock. next, garcia and her friends spun off caramail, a free email service, to compete with hotmail and yahoo! - but in french. \"caramail was able to succeed because france wasn't an important market for americans,\" garcia says, with more than a trace of amusement. caramail was user-friendly, and it quickly started adding chat rooms and organizing tools to keep its clients loyal - and online. by october 1999, when the dutch bank abn amro put about $2 million into the company, there were more than a million subscribers. by this february, when garcia et alia sold caramail to the sweden-based portal spray for an undisclosed amount of stock, the number of subscribers had doubled and was increasing by 12,000 daily.by then, caramail had moved to a building with a private garden in the quiet and refined 7th arrondissement. \"rive gauche,\" garcia says, with a laugh that verges on a giggle. \"tr\u00e8s chic.\" the garden, she adds, is especially nice for her cocker spaniel, n\u00e9m\u00e9sis, who comes to work with her every day.\"in silicon valley, it's the garage. here it's the maid's room.\"but most of those who began in the east end of paris try to hang on in the old neighborhood. the popular family-services startup magique emilie, for instance, just moved from its fourth-floor walk-up on rue d'aboukir to larger quarters around the corner. it's not just the price per square foot or the telecom backbone that makes them want to stay - after all, colt telecom workers have been to the sewers of the chic 7th arrondissement, too. and it's not just the nice little restaurants or networking opportunities. this is france, which means there's a kind of existential statement connected to the neighborhood: a general feeling that french technology needs not only a place but a face of its own - an icon that clicks in your mind, even if you've never been there. the east end of paris is just that kind of place - whether it's eventually called silicon sentier, republic alley, or something else; whether it's where most of the capital's internet companies wind up being, or have been, or only where they'd kind of like to be.down on the street, sentier is still the garment district, a world of handcarts and traffic jams, sweat and shmattes. \"here, there used to be wool fiber - now it's optical fiber,\" says philippe hardoux, in the pristine new quarters of rosebud technologies at 32 rue des je\u00fbneurs, where he recently moved from the remote corner of the city near p\u00e8re-lachaise cemetery. he has been in the networking business since 1995, which makes him an old-timer and something of a philosopher. his company is all about picks and shovels, hardoux says, rather than content. it's made most of its money developing intranets and web sites for content publishers, competing with us companies such as vignette. so why did he call it rosebud? because he loves citizen kane, he says, though he isn't enamored of the empire-builder based on william randolph hearst. \"it's the other side of the mirror: it's the loss of innocence.\" ah, i say, having some trouble following the logic, but knowing that it is very french. and how has it worked out? \"there is so much stress,\" says hardoux, \"so much fun.\"this work/fun factor strikes me almost everywhere i go among france's self-described internautes, and at first it seems to me amazingly un-french. since the days of the bastille and the guillotine, neither money nor the work required to make it has been held in much esteem by french society. the revolution imagined itself an act of the stinking, pantless poor, for whom work was slavery, overthrowing the perfumed and powdered aristocrats, for whom work was contemptible. in the france of today, ideals are still important: libert\u00e9, egalit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9. the intellect. l'amour. and food, of course. but to extol the virtues of sweat and sacrifice, or to make money in order to make still more money - well, even the bourgeoisie think that's despicably bourgeois. \"we don't like money, and you like money,\" says a former finance minister, drawing a distinction - and a rather essential one - between the french and american spirits of enterprise.there is another great tradition among the french, however, especially the young, and it's their taste for idealistic adventure. their great hero is arthur rimbaud, the fin-de-si\u00e8cle poetic genius who burned out at 19 and spent the rest of his short life rambling in lost corners of the orient. the french love wanderers: saint-exup\u00e9ry and ushua-ia, paris-dakar and doctors without borders. one of the hottest french search engines calls itself nomade.fr. the men and women huddled at the temple d'or see themselves as - and they are - part of the new generation of creative wanderers.the guy in the round glasses and the sheepskin vest is the reason these particular wanderers ended up in paris' east end, just three short metro stops from sentier. his name is laurent edel, and he's 30 years old. i follow him across the street from the temple d'or and through some high iron gates, under a big, neon-lit top hat proclaiming the presence of a nightclub called gibus, for the innovative frenchman who created the collapsible top hat. \"this was my playground when i was a kid,\" says edel as we walk past the sculptured caryatids, gray with industrial grime, that support the building's portal. beneath skylights, a long central hall with a concrete floor stretches ahead of us. the space once housed an equestrian circus, then a machine shop. edel's grandparents, leather wholesalers from poland, bought it after world war ii so they could fill its ateliers with garment workers and inventory. even today, many of the internet companies have merely pasted their names over the gold-and-red leopard logo of a departed furrier called marc dominique.a year ago, edel was working for paribas - for billaut at l'atelier, in fact - doing roadshows for startups. he'd been all over the world looking for opportunities, spending a year in silicon valley and a couple of years in vietnam when that was the place to go.the sentier had 30 startups at year-end. now there are 200 and counting.back in paris, he started talking to some of his friends who were looking for space to launch their internet businesses. all were working for large corporations, most were living in rich neighborhoods. two of them, chine lanzmann and alexandra de waresquiel (owner of the dog moose), developed the business plan for their webzine for women, newsfam.com, on the tables of the historic caf\u00e9 de flore.there was talk of setting up in the practical, soulless suburbs of boulogne or levallois-perret. then edel thought of his old playground in the heart of the city. \"we had a vision that it would be cool,\" he says at his spare office looking out over the rooftops toward montmartre. and the vision grew. a dozen companies are now installed, some of them barely more than a desk, a laptop, and an idea, and some of them, like nptv, the recipients of millions of dollars in private investment and headed toward highly anticipated ipos. in a nearby office, young veterans of the stock market have set up tradingcentral.com, an online newsletter. in another, employees at plantes et jardins are helping the french tend their gardens. k-mobile is preparing to provide sms messaging and wireless web service to mobile phone users, while super-secr\u00e9taire.com is offering relief for the overwhelmed.the whole place rocks. when venture capitalists come to the building after 8 pm, the only way upstairs is through the gibus nightclub. on weekdays, a school for african and brazilian dance holds classes in the middle of the building - beneath the skylights - and the most sympa brazilian bar-resto-club in paris, favela chic, just moved here from oberkampf.house music - homemade with computers, often in garages - has a special place at 18 rue du faubourg du temple. streampower.net, a video studio and service center setting up on the second floor, grew directly out of the electronic music scene that france invaded with groups like daft punk and air. the founding partners, benoit mennesson and gil machac, both 28, have been webcasting from europe since 1996. mennesson is a musician who calls himself paikam when he's recording house music and metis (to take note of his mixed african blood) when he's recording jazz and funk. streampower is pulling together a network that will help navigate on-demand video content, and packaging a talk show called public alley. the day i visit their spare, undecorated offices, mennesson and machac are signing with investors for another $300,000.\"people work hard here,\" says edel - but, he adds, \"it's basically a club med village.\" edel is clearly an apostle of romantic realism. \"it's very sexy now to work for a startup. it was not two years ago,\" he says. graduates of france's top schools - les grandes \u00e9coles - used to set their sights on running the national government or managing big corporations. today they aim to be entrepreneurs. of course, in this business, educational credentials aren't everything - in fact, they're often not even relevant. \"it's more about guts, and i don't think that the grandes \u00e9coles give guts,\" says edel. \"good projects come from people who have a great idea and awesome ambition. the other excellent projects are from people with 5 or 10 years' experience who want to put that online.\"edel peers at me over his glasses, making sure i understand what all this means in a society as burdened with tradition - and taxes - as france is. yes, those who make money will wind up giving a lot to the government. but there's so much money to be made, and these dot-commers' sights aren't set on as many zeros as americans' tend to be. \"everybody's thinking of making a couple of million dollars, minimum,\" says edel, \"and they are willing to pay a million in taxes because they know that, at their previous jobs, it would have taken them 10 years to make that much. what the internet offers us is the prospect of becoming free and rich, and having fun, very rapidly. everybody is willing to pay for that. and when i see - as i did the other day - 300 people waiting in line at a resto du coeur (soup kitchen) on r\u00e9publique, i think it's ok to pay taxes, if it will help.\" edel thought about this for a second. \"for money, the right place, i guess, is dublin, or the right place is the uk. but here, it's not money for money. it's money for freedom to do other things. and, i guess, we really think we can change something.\"in france, just as in the us, the new technology has sparked an age of innocence. but in the great war for control of the information age, these guys could wind up like so many poets in the trenches of the somme, their ideals discarded, their ambitions overwhelmed. as michel birnbaum of close brothers puts it, \"the traditional groups do not want startups to take a bite out of their markets. that is what they learned from america.\" france telecom, despite several failed acquisitions and alliances in the past year, still has the dominant service provider, wanadoo, and portal, voila. the kind of success enjoyed by michel meyer, who just took public his independent portal, multimania, to the tune of $800 million, is the exception, not a rule.the french state is more than a government in the minds of its people. \"the frenchman expects his happiness on earth to come from the state,\" says jean-michel billaut. \"he's just made that way.\" over the past half-century, french governments coddled and restricted, inspired and repressed their people, eventually lulling them to sleep. for the 30 years after world war ii - les trente glorieuses, as they're called - massive government investment and state-owned companies rebuilt france and restored its prosperity. billions of tax dollars were invested in industries that made big planes, atomic reactors, and high-speed trains. government officials saw no room for a new economy. so when the old economy stagnated, and unemployment approached 13 percent in the 1980s and '90s, it seemed there was no place to go.vcs were a rarity (there was the problem of an exit strategy), and other traditional financial tools were under siege. the supposedly pro-business gaullist government slapped stock options with massive taxes that included retroactive social charges. the high tech companies that had managed to get off the ground - software designers like business objects and bvrp, or smartcard manufacturer gemplus - were threatened with extinction.the goals are more financially modest, more intellectually ambitious. very french.then, in june 1997, socialist lionel jospin was elected as the new prime minister. jospin himself is not cutting-edge: it has been reported that he doesn't even carry a cell phone. but he brought in as finance minister dominique strauss-kahn, who was willing to challenge the most fundamental french assumptions. \"we had to explain to the people that the future is risky - and that there is no future without risk,\" strauss-kahn says now.the new finance minister set out to encourage - to re-create, really - the french entrepreneurial class. he changed state policies that prevented french researchers from founding companies based on the technologies they developed, and he fought the draconian anti-encryption laws that had kept france enslaved to the minitel's elementary technology. to get around the gaullist law on stock options (the socialist coalition as a whole wasn't inclined to overturn them), he created a new class of options for companies less than 15 years old, on which taxes are now as little as 20 percent.during strauss-kahn's term, the amount of venture capital invested in france shot up from 161.2 million euros to 259.6 million in a year, while the overall investment capital in unlisted companies surged from 656 million to 2.6 billion. the nouveau march\u00e9 took off: 150 companies are listed now, and soon there will be 500 of them. the amount of money raised there went from 76.2 million euros in 1997 to 360 million in 1999.bruno vanryb, whose bvrp software in levallois-perret has been around since 1984 (the company designed winphone and winfax), was part of the pre-internet generation of entrepreneurs that led the options battle. \"now you have real startup investment: $3 to $4 million at the beginning,\" he says. those numbers sound low by american standards, and they are. but the goals are different. \"you cannot say it's the american culture coming to france,\" says vanryb. \"the emphasis is more on the quality of innovation than on the quality of market leadership.\" more financially modest, that is, and more intellectually ambitious. yes, it sounds french.\"strauss-kahn was the only guy in the government who really understood what was going on,\" says vanryb. but the finance minister resigned late last year, when he came under investigation for corruption by france's version of a special prosecutor. (he denies any wrongdoing, and the case is running its course in the courts.) his supporters see him as the victim of a vast conspiracy - perhaps even as france's first internet martyr. as one told me, \"somebody has to pay for all this change.\" today, strauss-kahn has a comfortable office near les invalides, where he stays in close touch with friends and supporters on an ice-blue apple ibook. after the encryption battle, he says, \"i got a message from a friend that said, 'the maginot line has fallen.'\"strauss-kahn is confident his successors at the finance ministry will keep up the good work. but vanryb and others have their doubts. these pre-internet pioneers founded the interest group croissance+ (growth plus), and have seen it burgeon to 600 members - making it a unique and major lobbying power. but they take nothing for granted: they know their country and its governments too well. \"we like to say that a french entrepreneur can run with the best in the world,\" says vanryb, \"but he's wearing handcuffs and shackles.\"until recently, you had to be an escape artist to succeed in france, so it's fitting that the imaginative french artists of escape led the way for a lot of internet startups. building on the national passion for quality comic books, or bandes dessin\u00e9es, french designers of computer games grew fast in the 1980s and expanded vastly in the 1990s. bruno bonnell cofounded infogrames with schoolfriend christophe sapet in lyon in 1983, exploiting what came to be known as \"the french touch\" for \"wonderful graphics and weird worlds,\" as he puts it. bonnell and sapet now control several french companies with market caps in the tens of billions of dollars, including infosources. last year, infogrames acquired gt interactive software in the united states. meanwhile, titus interactive, founded by the brothers henri and eric caen in 1985, and ubi soft, established by the five guillemot brothers in 1986, also became global players. alone in the dark, rayman, v rally, even looney tunes - whether you play them on sega, playstation, nintendo, a pc, pda, or mobile phone - are all made by french-owned companies.not to be outdone, the voracious vivendi conglomerate bought the american gamemaker cendant software in 1998 (with warcraft and diablo, among other products) and folded it into its multimedia division, havas interactive. but bonnell feels more than ready to meet the challenge. he remembers well the way it was in france when he and sapet were 25 and had managed to scrape together $10,000 to start their business. \"we were hyperidealistic,\" he says, \"but it was like trying to shoot the moon with gunpowder.\" bonnell and sapet had to visit 17 banks before they could find one that was willing to let such upstarts so much as open a business account. now, several ipos later, bonnell's over the moon, and looking to conquer the world with new games and new technologies. he imagines playing a game on interactive television, then going out for a walk or on business; his mobile phone rings, tells him his game character is under attack, and asks him what to do about it ...bonnell, who can afford a sense of humor, pauses for effect.\"of course the biggest game you can play on every platform - interactive tv, pc, pda, mobiles - exists today. you know what it is?\"i give. what?\"i've never seen so many ... desires. we will see nouveaux riches like never before.\"\"the stock market.\"france has all kinds of characters looking to get in on that game. when veo's kevin moir and ciaran quinn imported the first tuesday concept from britain to france last year, they held the monthly meetings in trendy little bars. with no agenda other than to trade cards, talk shop, listen in passing to a visiting guru, meet a few members of the press, and drink, people showed up by the dozens - then by the hundreds. and by the first tuesday of february this year, the trendy little bars have been replaced by the cavernous interior of the 19th-century bourse de commerce. above the crowd of 1,200, the dome's interior is painted with a vast allegory showing france's view of world trade a century and a half ago: america is represented by a fallen flag and naked indians. the shaven-pated, black-clad kids swilling champagne and talking t1 lines don't notice. if they were to, they might be puzzled. america may be feared and envied - or admired and emulated - but no one on this floor would hold it in contempt.i talk to a bright-eyed man in his thirties, who tells me he has started a company that sells made-to-measure men's suits online, then proceeds to show me how i can take the measurements myself at home. i don't get the impression that his business has taken off. a pair of engineers in their forties tell me they're exploring business-to-business possibilities - but they don't think french purchasing departments are catching on, though in fact a few b2b startups with connections to big old companies like airbus and danone are doing quite well. jacques-christophe blouzard, who runs the french affiliate of uk-based lastminute.com from offices on rue des je\u00fbneurs, tries to convince me that the french really can deliver services with a smile - and on time. eric perbos-brinck, head of bravonestor.com, gives me a crash course on the relative merits of shopbots and tells me why his, from mysimon, is better (even though it's facing tough competition from buycentral and kelkoo). i like these guys. but the general - almost inescapable - feeling i get here is one of longing.\"there is a real awakening of entrepreneurs,\" patrick robin tells me over his cell phone after i track him down one afternoon. \"i've never seen so many ... desires.\" and robin has seen it all. in 18 years, he's created 25 startups in different domains. his imaginet, started in 1994 to create and host web sites, was sold to colt telecom in 1998. though isdnet, uunet, and france telecom all offer similar services, colt is the provider most closely identified with internet pioneers in paris. that's partly due to skillful marketing (startups get 50 percent off, for instance) and a lot of investment. but it's also because of robin. from his offices near the canal st-martin, he plays the role of business angel to several fledgling companies, and it may well be that he's personally responsible for a lot of the atmosph\u00e8re around sentier and in republic alley. \"today, there's no more amazon jungle to discover, no more virgin lands to conquer,\" he once told the journal du net. \"what's left to us? enterprise or militancy. the creation of a business is still a new amazon wilderness. i say i'm a 'startup lover' because every time it's a little love story.\"for consumers, the romance is only beginning, partly because delivery of basic services is lagging behind the hype. affordable high-speed access is still a problem: few french homes are cabled, and the cable modems available have a very bad rep among the few who've tried them. i ordered adsl from france telecom in january, and finally got it in march. following a recent court ruling that ft must allow competitors to offer adsl service on its phone lines, the venerable phone giant may have to become a bit more responsive. but europe is used to being wireless. since 1996, i've had a gsm phone i can plug in to my laptop to get online just about anywhere i go, from london to mauritius: there's no need to convince me that europe's got the wireless edge.the newest available mobile phone technology is a disappointment, though. at 14.4 kbps or less, wap is far from wondrous. what it reminds me of most is the minitel - sloooow. any comparison with the web, at this point, is pure fancy. the white pages never seem to work. there are news headlines, but only seven at a time, and the stories that follow are just a couple of sentences long. there's a service that's supposed to tell me how to avoid traffic jams, but by the time i tap in my itinerary, i'm usually in the middle of one.all this should work better when mobile phone data speeds increase to 60 kbps this fall. third-generation broadband phones are supposed to be just around the corner - by 2003 or so; they will be fast enough to allow for good real-time video and net surfing as smooth as on a desktop.many french consumers may make the transition from their old wired dumb terminal, the minitel, to their new wireless dumb terminal, the mobile, without ever using a pc. from republic alley startups such as k-mobile and nptv to philippe hardoux's rosebud technologies to the corporate offices of a communications giant like vivendi, the rush is on to develop portals that will work together on interactive television, on desktops, and on the new phones. vivendi's chair, jean-marie messier, says he's especially excited by the idea that the wireless network will know where you are at all times, match your current location with your known preferences, and tell you what you want to know (or ought to buy) in the neighborhood - perhaps before you even ask.this raises more than just the usual questions of privacy. for the french, the new economy provokes a kind of existential angst. at the finance ministry, bureaucrats already are pondering the implications of a society that no longer holds money in contempt. during st\u00e9phane boujnah's last days on the job, he wondered aloud if the country could cope with hundreds of new millionaires. \"we will see nouveaux riches like we've never seen before.\" will that cause a new counterrevolution by the unwired and the unrich? in france it might. but as the country catches up - and, as the history of tv and cell phone technology proves, france is very good at catching up - the advances could also be a tremendous source of validation and pride for those who've never clicked a mouse or scrolled a cell phone menu.what won't change very much are the streets of paris. slowly, the ads in caf\u00e9 windows for minitel chat sites are giving way to posters for search engines. the major papers all have their multimedia pages, and there's no shortage of dot-com coverage on television. internet caf\u00e9s are plentiful, from vivendi's own near the etoile to the web bar, among iron beams and balconies near r\u00e9publique. but it is precisely the way the new technology has blended into the city - been hidden behind nondescript doors on rue du sentier or in the mansions of the rive gauche, taken up residence beneath the skylights of republic alley, and electrified the late-night air of ordinary caf\u00e9s like the temple d'or - that gives wired paris an atmosphere like no place else in the world.plusgo to: jargon watchseeing the sitesnetwork hubsfrance by the numbers"}
