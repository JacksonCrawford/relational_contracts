[editor's note: in the original version of this story published february 25, the email address was identified as \"videoupdates@gohip.com,\" which was invalid. gohip contacted wired news about the error on march 14.]calls to justin hirsch, the site's contact filed with network solutions, reached an answering service that does not know the name of hirsch's company and forwards his calls to a voice mail. messages left there were not returned.a public records search discovered that hirsch is involved with several internet companies, all registered at the same street address in chatsworth, california. among the companies is babenet, ltd., and under gohip's adult category section, babenet is the first site listed.other companies associated with hirsch include bigwebtools, a company that claims to be an internet marketing firm. a search for bigwebtools on gohip calls up links that direct users to hard-core sex sites, many of which are based in japan and russia.at the bigwebtools site, there is testimony from a \"robert molder\" of rmi networks, who says of bigwebtools, \"calling them was the best business decision we've made since we started our company.\"but a spokesman from chicago-based rmi networks says he's never heard of bigwebtools or robert molder.babenet and bigwebtools both have the same telephone number that reaches justin hirsch's answering service.calls to alchemy communications, the los angeles-based company that hosts gohip's site, were not returned.alchemy lists the site at the top of its \"featured clients\" page.\"discover gohip!\" the site reads, \"and change your life on the web.\"exactly, says dahl, one of gohip's dissatisfied users.\"i compliment gohip for a fine marketing effort as i certainly know who they are. i hate them, but i know who they are,\" he said.(this story was updated march 14, 2000).there's no biz like e-bizdiscover more net culturethere's no biz like e-bizdiscover more net culturesee also: microsoft's activex too active?see also: microsoft's activex too active?"}
