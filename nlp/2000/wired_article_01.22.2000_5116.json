(the self-congratulatory press releases quickly followed.)the interesting thing, though, was how the ftc decided on the members. over 180 people applied, and about 40 were picked. you'd think that of that pool of eager applicants, the ftc would have an exquisite selection of potential choices. nope.the commission decided to pass over veteran privacy advocates and technical experts -- like systemexperts cto dan geer, a security guru and usenix officer since 1985 -- to choose someone who hadn't even applied for the gig. they picked e. david ellington, chairman and ceo of netnoir, an online services company that targets african-americans.it probably didn't hurt that ellington gave us$2,500 to democratic candidates -- including $1,000 to al gore -- during the last two years, according to federal election commission records. an ftc staff member wouldn't say why ellington was chosen except to say the commission wanted to \"make its best efforts\" to make sure the group was representative.\"the commission retained discretion in the absence of a nomination to appoint advisory committee members to ensure balance,\" said jessica rich, who pointed us to a federal register notice in december that said precisely that.perhaps the ftc hoped serving on the advisory panel, which first meets on 4 february, would prove educational? netnoir asks visitors for their home addresses, birthdates, and telephone numbers, but does not have a posted privacy policy saying what it will do -- or won't do -- with that info.that runs afoul of the better business bureau's principles for ethical conduct for web businesses, not to mention the ftc's own guidelines. the only other person on the panel who didn't apply was robert henderson of ncr corporation. the ftc said he replaced peter reid, also of ncr, who did apply.forbes, gore talk tech: kent lassman from the free-market group <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"externallink\",\"outgoingurl\":\"http://www.cse.org/\"}' href=\"http://www.cse.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">citizens for a sound economy</a> has a hectic job: following presidential wannabes as they stump in iowa. he writes in to tell us that tech issues have been on their minds.\"when forbes took q & a, the local precinct captain who had given the introduction read him the riot act on internet taxation ... and he has a good position,\" lassman said in an email message talking about gop hopeful steve forbes.he also cornered vice president al gore.\"this evening gore said, 'we've got to use the antitrust laws much more aggressively.' i asked if that meant in high tech. he asked if i meant the microsoft case. i said no ... intel, microsoft, [and the] merger policy with regard to att-tci and aol-tw.
