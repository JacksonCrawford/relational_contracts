\"i can\u2019t tell you,\" he said. \"i think that after the law is changed, opening the market to competition, we will get the licenses. fast internet is important to bezeq and to the people of israel. everyone is waiting for this to clear the bottleneck.\"in the meantime, the approximately 750,000 internet users in israel (according to the european survey of information society in israel) are, etzioni argues, at a competitive disadvantage in the global economy. etzioni estimated that in 1998 lack of fast internet connections cost the israeli economy $61 million dollars, part of this in \"inflated telephone and internet bills.\" in terms of time, this was 2.1 million work hours and 5 million leisure hours wasted, which he estimated at another $40 million.kim mayroze, a freelance website designer in jerusalem, knows this all too well. \"it\u2019s outrageous. i spend so much time online, and it's expensive,\" she complained. \"and sending graphics files of the size i work with clogs up my bandwidth. i am freelance and my time is money. i thought this country was supposed to be technologically advanced. i call this the dark ages. how are we supposed to work like this?\"while waiting for a license, nonstop, a subsidiary of the cable company matav set up specifically to provide fast internet access, is not sitting around twiddling its thumbs. \"we are carrying out fast internet trials with about a hundred people,\" said neta kaminski, nonstop\u2019s marketing manager for residential customers.due to the lack of progress in regulation, the trials have gone on longer than planned, but nonstop has made use of the time. \"we are improving the service and (when we get the license) we will be in a better position.\"the company is also working on localized broadband content such as video news programs.\"we want to connect everyone,\" said kaminski. \"we are very frustrated, but we are optimistic. we expect to get approval by the end of 2000.\"daniel elyiakim, director of interactive services at yes, is less positive. \"i have no estimate of how long it will take,\" elyiakim said. yes just launched israel\u2019s first satellite television option and is ready to provide fast internet access of up to 1mbps.elyiakim believes that only satellites can bring true \"fast internet.\" with adsl, he said, you have an 8mbps pipe for the \"last mile\" but the data is still coming from the isps at 50kbps. \"we can bring it straight to the user from the backbone,\" he said. yes is straining at the bit to be allowed to do this. as elyiakim said in hebrew: \"it is an egg that hasn\u2019t been laid in israel yet.\" a truly golden egg.as everyone waits, etzioni remains a realist.\"optimistic? i am not that optimistic. it is not going to happen that quickly.\" however, he is going to do whatever he can to spur on the government. \"last week, i told (the finance minister) that my goal with this working group is to save only one day (without fast internet). one day is worth millions! i am going to sacrifice many hours, and even if i just save one day, it's worth it.\""}
