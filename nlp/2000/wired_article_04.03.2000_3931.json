will mp3 and other downloadable formats eventually replace the cd?i asked a salesman at my local circuit city. he touted cd and minidisc players and recorders, even though the store also sold the memory stick walkman and mp3 players. he said limiting yourself to playing music off the internet would take away the convenience of recording your existing music collection.besides, he said, flash memory cards for the memory stick, priced at over $150, are very expensive -- much higher than the $3 blank cassette. he suggested the recordable cd player, which allows recording onto a blank cd, as a viable contender.the myriad of audio devices may lack awareness by consumers, fenton said, but he's also a fan. and until that gains ground, he's happy with minidisc, sony's format for compressing sound onto what looks like a mini-cd.after a failed initial effort, sony repositioned and re-launched the product several years ago. suddenly it was not a replacement for the cd player, but for the tape recorder. the sound quality is sub-cd but certainly better than analog tape. the portable versions are extremely small and lightweight, and blank discs are only a few dollars.adding an mp3 decoder would make it ideal, but sony's schrader said that wasn't in the cards for the minidisc.minidisc? it seems like a dated solution -- not quite where i thought i'd end up in the age of digital music and the internet.but it's all about knowing how to wade through the options.\"the consumer for these products is 'gen y' ... 12- to 24-year-olds. they get it, they understand the tradeoffs, they understand technology,\" schrader said.his advice to the tragically technologically un-hip: just buy the device that matches your collection. a cd player for the cd collection, tape player for the tape collection.\"buy whatever you think is cool, and assume you'll have to replace it in a couple years,\" said fenton of sound and vision.ah well, so much for keeping my new portable minidisc recorder for the nearly two decades i had my cassette player. and i'm not looking forward to making another audio format decision in a couple of years."}
