states and europe, making it difficult to come up with a set of global standards to govern the new medium, said a professor addressing a conference on the issue here. u.s. law places an almost unassailable right to free speech at the core of its constitution, but has only vague protections for privacy rights, said shalini venturelli, a professor of international communications at american university. european constitutions, on the other hand, have strong guarantees of privacy, but give governments considerably more latitude in controlling content, she said.as a result, venturelli said, european governments already have found 35 reasons and means for restricting the content allowed on internet websites. so the u.s. position on net privacy protections, which europeans frequently view as entirely too weak, is not going to be easily accepted by a few diplomats or trade negotiators in a forum like the world trade organization.venturelli made her comments during the first full day of a conference on european and american perspectives on regulating the internet being held this weekend at the university of washington.\"there's a huge gap here,\" venturelli said. \"you can't take constitutional law (in europe) and apply it to entities (like corporations) to be free from content regulation, to be free from the burden of gaining consent of individuals for publicizing their information, because individuals have a human right to that data.\"a human right means they can't be alienated from it. there's no such thing here.\"the problem is compounded by an essential ambivalence about how we deal with the issues of privacy in this country, both in law and in society in general, said tim gleason, a journalism and communications professor from the university of oregon. he noted that the right to keep information private is more closely guarded in this country when it is collected by the government than by private entities.\"our thinking about privacy in the united states is relatively confused,\" gleason said.drawing a distinction between whether control of personal information is a matter of privacy or of property rights is an important question, he added.\"one of the ways we clarify some of the confusion (is to ask), 'is the use of your name a privacy right or a property right?' because it's valuable information that you have the right to have some control over the use of.\"the two sides of the atlantic also differ radically in the way they grant fundamental rights to corporations versus than individuals, venturelli said.\"the u.s. is unique in this in the world,\" she said.\"legal entities have the same rights as humans. this is not self-evident in the constitution, it is not self-evident in any law. it is the result of a decision of the supreme court.\"still other problems posed by the internet transcend the differences between the u.s. and the european versions of constitutional law,\" she noted.\"we have irreconcilable tax regimes, but i don't necessarily see that as a foreign policy problem right now because we have the same issues between the individual states and the federal government. the whole area is inclined to threaten the whole tax-sovereignty notion of the nation-state model as it has evolved, and we might have to redefine what we mean by a nation-state if its ability to levy taxes is undermined.\"my argument is that we have to think of the internet as a new information space,\" venturelli said.\"instead of fighting with each other to see whose laws are going to win out, we have to rethink the whole definition of the regulatory code, and stop having these strategic battles of your laws versus our laws and singapore's laws and china's laws. dispute resolution is one way of looking at these things, so that nobody's laws apply.\"by the same token,\" she said, \"there has to be a good deal of caution taken to make sure that the dispute resolution systems being adopted are not weighted to favor the big players, or the vitality of the system and the chances for future innovations and creativity will be quashed.\"an example of the approach she opposes is the system for resolving issues between domain-name holders -- often large multinationals -- and domain-squatters, who register the names in advance of their being claimed.\"the dispute resolution system that the department of commerce has come up with, which has now been written into the bylaws of iccan, is fundamentally flawed because the domain-holders pay the dispute-resolution administrators, so they are fundamentally biased in favor of the domain-holders,\" she said."}
