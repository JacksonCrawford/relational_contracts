(the device most widely used now is both fragile and hard to fix.) the other, a \"phase-change incubator,\" allows individuals or village leaders an easy, inexpensive, and electricity-free device that enables them to test the safety of their drinking water.citing the hundreds of millions of africans who would benefit from a cheap and dependable flour mill, and the estimated billion people around the globe who lack certain access to clean water, smith opted for an open-source solution to her distribution problem.\"the key issue with these devices is technology transfer,\" she said of her decision to forego any intellectual property protection. \"patents just get in the way. i want as much infringement as possible.\"she noted that she'd be using her prize as seed money to start developing and distributing her water-testing device.on the other end of the technology spectrum, lim, khan, and murphy -- all electrical engineering phd students -- took home the first annual unisphere-sponsored team prize for innovation in telecommunications and networking.their award-winning contraption, considerably more compact than either of smith's inventions (as magnanti pointed out, it's roughly the size of pocket lint), is a \"reconfigurable wavelength-selective optical add/drop switch.\"although the title's a mouthful, the presenters stressed its importance, citing one professor's assessment that it \"will have a profound effect on the future development of optical communication.\"and as the press packet points out, \"their fabrication and design research methodology focusing upon bragg-grating-based high-performance integrated optical devices has already won them critical acclaim.\"murphy compared the device, essentially a filter that can pick out a single signal from a fiber optic line crammed with signals, to the electric circuit on a cable tv set-top box that sifts out the channel you've selected from all the others.stringing fiber optic lines the last few miles from the switching station to the home requires both lots of money and tiny, trusty devices that'll make the strands of glass useful to the rest of us who don't know a bragg-grating from a hammermill.with the help of the award-winning switch, the speakers noted, your high-bandwidth tele/fax/compu/vision of the future will be able to screen out all but the few signals you're interested in.no promises were made, however, about the invention's application to the no. 1 source of noise on the phone networks today: telemarketers.tinker around with gadgets and gizmosread more technology newstinker around with gadgets and gizmosread more technology news"}
