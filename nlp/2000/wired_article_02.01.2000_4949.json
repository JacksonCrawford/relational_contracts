in the trenches of technology in its third annual ceremony. by lakshmi chaudhry and kendra mayfield.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "02.01.2000 10:25 AM", "text": "san francisco -- this year's top 25 women on the web awards honored not just well publicized high-fliers like hewlett packard ceo carly fiorina, but also directed attention toward women not usually covered by the media. \"we defined getting ahead as making a difference to the internet community,\" lead organizer mary choy said during the san francisco ceremony monday night. \"we looked for pioneers.\"monday's winners ranged from top-ranking business executives to such web-based activists as anita brown, the founder of black geeks online.\"we really tried to have as many women that have as many of these different characteristics,\" said rebecca eisenberg, one of the judges and a 1999 award winner.in the three years since its inception, choy says the organization has been pushed to broaden its criteria to allow for greater diversity in the kind of work that may be considered for recognition. \"we were initially concerned that we would be getting the same names every year,\" she said. \"instead, we've received new names every year and from different sectors.\"last year's winners included senator barbara boxer, who was chosen for her contribution to internet legislation and melinda gates, chosen for her work at the gates library foundation. this year, the judges were looking at women using the internet from a broader perspective, using different types of technologies, said anna billstrom, organizer for sfwow.this year, the nomination process was automated via the web and included over 200 nominees, with more worldwide submissions than in previous years, billstrom said.this year, there were far more educators and designers in the mix, choy said.\"one of our judges was against choosing anyone who was a cio,\" choy said. \"she felt we should not be recognizing people who already get plenty of attention.\"but as with previous years, the list also includes corporate heavy-hitters like autodesk ceo carol bartz and charles schwab cio dawn lepore.\"some people feel we are not expanding our criteria fast enough. they think we should be exclusively recognizing people who are not vps,\" choy said.\"it's regrettable and pretty much unavoidable that we're not able to honor everybody that should be honored,\" eisenberg said. \"we try to portray a cross-section so that people who are programmers, who don't make headlines like carly fiorina does, community organizers who don't have the marketing budgets that julie wainright has, can be recognized.\"the most well known figures were notably absent from the event. \"who does she think she is, the ceo of a fortune 500 company?\" asked comedian heather gold of subvert.com, referring to hewlett packard's fiorina.emcee moira gunn of npr's technation similarly announced the ceo of pets.com, \"are you julie wainright -- oh, empty chair.\"while most of the high-profile honorees were absent, one winner, carol bartz, ceo of autodesk, sent a younger coworker to accept the trophy-like award on her behalf.honoree gail williams, executive director of the online community the well, agrees there is a greater need to recognize activists on the web. \"the real heroes are girls and women working in small non-profits, doing outreach to those who don't have access to the net,\" she said. \"those people are more deserving of our applause than those getting the big paychecks because they're putting more on the line.\"apart from disagreements over criteria, choy says the awards ceremony plays an important part in offering women a diverse range of role models.\"it's inspiring for people in the audience to hear how they got there. each person chooses what to share,\" she said.\"i found a role model who wasn't competing with the boys, she was just being better than them,\" said lawrence berkeley national lab computer scientist deborah agarwal, generating a roar of applause.\"the internet has made it possible for a lot of women to really be able to shine,\" said honoree radha basu, ceo of support.com. \"i absolutely believe the internet brings out our best skills, which is why you see a lot of women heading up internet companies and being successful at it.\"the internet has enabled women to establish support systems that are \"far superior\" to the traditional \"old boys'\" networks used by men, choy said.but not all award recipients agree with the philosophy underlying the top 25 event.some of the previous honorees have used the occasion to challenge the category of 'women in technology.' \"we've had former recipients who have said 'i don't see myself as a woman.'\"but the impact of the organization is changing the minds of some women like marney morris, founder of animatrix.\"for years i fought against being called out as a woman. i felt women should just do the work,\" morris said.but she said she changed her mind after seeing how role models empower women.\"one sensibility women bring to the web is that every contribution is valid,\" animatrix founder marney morris said.others like williams caution the top 25 awards may become meaningless \"when the web becomes as ubiquitous as the telephone.\"\"honoring women on the web may become like recognizing women who drive cars,\" she said. \"on the other hand, this is an amazing time when women are breaking away from old stereotypes ... and we're not done with that struggle, which makes this an important reward.\"\"i look forward to the day that the web becomes as ubiquitous as the television,\" eisenberg said. \"then, we'll be able to still thank the women who are bringing interactivity, connectivity, and telecommunications to people all over the world.\"as long as challenges such as discrimination remain, \"there are always women on the forefront of this battle,\" eisenberg said. \"those are the women that we're always going to want to honor.\"and the top 25 for this year are ... deb agarwal, carol bartz, radha basu, denise brosseau, anita brown, kc claffy, joy covey, donna dubinsky, judith estrin, carly fiorina, ellen hancock, dawn lepore, marci lockwood, marney morris, catherine muther, jayne newell-lanza, olivia ongpin, deb richardson, linda sanford, megan smith, ellen ullman, heidi van arnem, julie wainwright, gail williams, and ann winblad."}
