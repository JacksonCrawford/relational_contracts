\"blues on a sunday,\" another earl/mcgriff collaboration - has the spiritual quality of a gospel number.sunny day real estatethe rising tide (time bomb)despite their unshakable association with the seattle grunge explosion, sunny day owe more to the prog-rock styling of early genesis (circa lamb lies down on broadway) than to nirvana. these 11 lushly orchestrated tracks feature geddy lee-like vocals over relentless drums and charged guitar work. with layered harmonic reflections and tamed piano, rising tide is their most emotive album to date.the infesticonsgun hill road (big dada)if the seminal rapumentary wild style were ever updated for hip hop's millennial age of excess, the infesticons would be a great choice to do the soundtrack. here, poet-producer mike ladd has imagined an epic musical war in which progressive versifying crushes mainstream rap, laying the abstruse poetry of anti-pop consortium, the mums, and saul williams over sounds ranging from alien-invasion death rays to brooding noise-rock.saint etiennesound of water (sub pop)armed with a formula for unique, kitschy dance hits, british band saint etienne emerged on the scene at the dawn of the '90s. the first albums were sample- and drum-machine-driven, but saint etienne's new release forsakes club music in favor of mature, structured compositions. sarah cracknell's angelic voice coats the sounds of soft tremolo guitar, gently bleeping synths, tinkling piano, and a string section produced by sean o'hagan of stereolab and the high llamas. sound of water flawlessly blends traditional instruments and modern technology to come up with symphonic electropop.thomas mapfumo and the blacks unlimitedchimurenga explosion (anonym)thomas mapfumo has revamped his sound by placing a trio of mbiras up front with the electric guitars, bringing the humble thumb piano's acoustic sound center stage. his politicized lyrics have earned him the name \"lion of zimbabwe,\" but this album has decidedly international influences - \"zvichapera\" delivers a reggae bounce, and \"kune rima\" echoes congolese soukous with its swooping bass lines and short guitar-mbira riffs. the swirling rhythms, relaxed horn charts, and soulful call-and-response between mapfumo and his backup singers give \"nhamo zvakare\" and \"chisi\" simmering power.steamreal time (atavistic)steam stretches the parameters of straight-ahead jazz with improvisational extravagance. saxophonist (and macarthur grant winner) ken vandermark maintains a strong sense of bohemian history, but his chicago quartet resists the pull of nostalgia. pianist jim baker supplies cerebral yet swinging structures, while bassist kent kessler and drummer tim mulvenna musically stalk the ever-expressive vandermark.street credpr\u00eat-\u00e0-port\u00e9g\u00e9afterburn rateclean sweepthe institute of higher g-forcesfac-droidsticky sightyour personal web scrawlerreadmemusiccardiac arrestgalaxy questthe city that never sleepsjust outta betaatlas shruggednoise \"r\" uscontributors"}
