his fate inextricably linked to that of the company that produced his operating system of choice.but in 1998, a frustrated draeker began looking for an operating system he could truly call his own -- and found linux.what draeker loved most about linux was access to the source code and the right to copy it, change it, and redistribute his changes.he's not a programmer -- and freely admits that he is not the best candidate to go meddling with the linux source -- but, says draeker, that wasn't the point.\"by adopting linux, i was finally in control of my own destiny,\" he said.marketing wouldn't change directions on him. research and development budgets wouldn't be cut. features wouldn't be dropped, and incomplete software wouldn't be shipped on the last day of the fiscal quarter.but it wasn't long after becoming a dedicated linux user that draeker noticed there were very few good games available for the platform. he became obsessed with the idea of founding a company that would bring pc games over to linux.\"at the time i really didn't even know whether it was possible to port games to linux.\"but after posting on usenet about his plans, draeker met a guy named sam lantinga.back then, linux was just beginning to show up on the radar screen. the market wasn't anything like it is today. there were no ipos, and no fortune 500 companies announcing adoption of and products for linux.draeker and lantinga knew they were gambling with their futures. and they named their company, loki entertainment software, after the trickster god in norse mythology who brings either glorious success or utter chaos, depending on his mood of the day.the company motto is world domination should be fun.shortly after they founded the company, lantinga and draeker took a trip to santa monica to activision's offices to talk about their upcoming title, civilization: call to power.lantinga reviewed the code and draeker, who was then working for san francisco law firm brobeck, phleger & harrison where he specialized in intellectual property transactions, negotiated the license terms.loki released civctp for linux in april 1999, just weeks after the windows version hit the shelves. it was an immediate hit in the growing linux user-community.draeker, now loki president, and lantinga, loki's lead programmer, have proven that a real market for shrink-wrapped, retail games for the linux platform does exist.they still struggle, though. the economics of the industry make secondary platforms unprofitable for mainstream application developers.open source games are a different issue. it would be easy to dismiss the idea simply because there are so few open source games which rise to the level that commercial game players expect, draeker said. however, he suspects that open source platforms will make real contributions to gaming very soon.\"at loki, we spend a great deal of time improving the necessary infrastructure and tools, then releasing them back to the community in the hopes that open source games will be developed,\" draeker said.for the immediate future though, loki will focus on porting games instead of creating their own titles. developing a new game can take many years, millions of dollars, with an end result that might be fun -- or might not, draeker said\"i think loki better serves the linux community by porting games that we know are good rather than rolling the dice on an original title,\" he said.over at the linuxworld expo this week, loki is showing heavy gear ii. the company will also be announcing, in conjunction with ati, upcoming hardware acceleration using smpeg, an open source mpeg playback library, and ati rage 128 cards. this will be the first time hardware accelerated mpeg will be available on linux, and it's an important step toward dvd support.loki will also be releasing 16 games in 2000.looking at the future of linux as a gaming platform, draeker says that it's interesting to note that pc gaming in general is not growing as quickly as the console market.\"some have pointed to this as evidence that the pc itself might be declining as a gaming platform. if so, i suspect that part of the problem is the ongoing difficulty of setting up windows, getting hardware configured, installing yet another version of directx, and still having a product that crashes all too often,\" he said.draeker believes that these are all areas where linux has big advantages over windows. in fact, he thinks that linux will be a superior gaming platform to windows and that the same game will run faster, more responsively, and more reliably on the same hardware under linux.linux itself is still at the early adopter stage. but draeker is convinced that open source software will continue to replace closed, proprietary solutions.\"the desktop of tomorrow might not run linux, but whatever it runs will be open source. and right now, linux appears to be the front runner in that race.\""}
