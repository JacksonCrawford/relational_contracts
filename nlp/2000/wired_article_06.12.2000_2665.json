pets,\" he said. \"it's just so generic. it's hard to get an emotional feel for a word like pets, and just putting a dot com on the end of the word doesn't make it sound special.\"still, cohen points out that there are other savvy people in the industry who disagree with his take on the whole naming issue.take for example santa monica, california-based ecompanies, another start-up incubator that paid $7.5 million late last year for the domain name business.com. it's using it to launch a company called -- you guessed it -- business.com.or take another example: the online seller of technical books formerly known as computer literacy. in march 1999, the publicly traded company changed its name to fatbrain.com and its stock market ticker symbol to (fatb) in a bid to draw more customers and raise its public profile.the strategy seemed to work pretty well with investors until late last year, when fatbrain.com shares started to slide and haven't recovered.aside from a few rare cases like fatbrain, swenson said it's unusual for a publicly traded company to change its name, either to drop or add a dot com. generally speaking, it's much easier for a private company to ditch an unfashionable suffix.\"the day you go public is in many cases the first time anyone's heard of you, so they'd never know there was a name change,\" swenson said.still, even internet companies that have been in the public eye for a while don't have to refer themselves as dot com. ebay, yahoo, and a host of other prominent web companies don't use a dot-com appendage.others use the suffix only for early marketing. for example, steve peletz, ceo of construction contracting site redladder.com, sees the use of a dot-com suffix as a temporary stage in the evolution of the company.\"as contractors start to know us and it becomes a household name, we will drop the dot com because it's just cumbersome,\" he said.in addition, there's the question of lasting relevance. with wireless commerce applications and squadrons of other emerging data technologies rapidly gaining ground, a company with a dot-com name runs the risk of looking outdated.that's part of the rationale epylon's george offers for keeping the \"e\" in the company name even as he's ditching the dot com. although individual technologies may change, it's a virtual certainty that businesses will continue to be conducted electronically.\"my sense is that the 'e' will be around much longer,\" he said."}
