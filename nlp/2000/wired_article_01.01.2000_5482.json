(go to 2026: space exploration, page 118.) his objective is a 500,000-cubic-foot tourist destination, which he believes bigelow aerospace can develop and produce at one-twelfth of nasa's cost for the international space station. whether the space-industrial complex or the private sector gets his lunar cruiser off the ground is not his primary concern. bigelow just wants to beat the competition in outer-space hospitality.three decades after former chair barron hilton envisioned an orbiting resort at a 1967 space conference, hilton hotels is considering an extraterrestrial counterpart to its las vegas-based star trek experience - and it's not alone. the japanese company shimizu has long discussed constructing an earth-orbiting destination. last year, richard branson announced plans for a space hotel, even registering a new company called virgin galactic airways.yet no one besides bigelow, say his boosters, is remotely approaching countdown. \"bigelow is the only fellow who's said he's going to commit his own money, who's hired a staff, and who plans to build a building,\" says bob haltermann, executive director of the space transportation association's space travel and tourism division. \"all the rest - the hiltons and whoever else has made noise - haven't put any money forward.\"inside bigelow's homey office, he shows me an artist's rendering of what that money will buy. interestingly, the lunar cruiser vaguely resembles a half-mile-long version of the stratosphere tower, but with rounded platforms at both ends designed to hold roughly 48 staterooms measuring 10 by 20 feet. these suites will come with a personal bath, luxury beds, communications systems, and, of course, heavenly views.one rotation per minute, imperceptible to inhabitants, will induce the equivalent of 40 percent of earth's gravity within the two large modules of staterooms. only at the center hub will passengers be able to cavort in zero gravity, should they desire.the man charged with getting these designs off the drawing board is gregory bennett, vice president of bigelow aerospace. bennett paid his dues as a nasa contractor and boeing engineer on the space station and space shuttle programs. and it shows. \"when you start looking at the bones and organs of this thing,\" bennett says of the rocket hotel, \"you'll see an awful lot of international space station technology.\"at bigelow aerospace, his staff of nine engineers, four industrial designers, and three secretaries includes an alumnus of the cold war-era soviet space agency and other bona fide rocket scientists. they are already heavily engrossed in details, worrying about rocket-plume impingement on the craft, considering where to use inflatable modules to extend the square footage, designing a block diagram of a proprietary ventilation system, and sketching out an orbiting fuel depot that might crack water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen for fuel.bennett estimates that about 45 shuttle-equivalent payloads will be required to truck the 2 million pounds of aluminum, carbon composites, and stainless steel into space for assembly, partly by remote-controlled robots.once the airlocks open to paying guests, the vp's foremost task is to prevent any titanic-scale disaster. in case of emergency, the space cruiser can separate into two self-sustaining portions. there will, of course, also be ample escape-pod life rafts. bennett believes another big worry - long-term exposure of crew members to high levels of radiation from outer space - can be solved by a proven shielding technology: water.for passengers who make it through preflight screening and training, blastoff will be half the fun. as the horizon curves and earth gradually diminishes into a complete sphere, guests will rendezvous with the lunar cruiser and set a course for the moon. (passengers will likely be ferried from earth orbit via a 20-minute shuttle ride, though engineers still need to iron out exactly how this will happen. plans may call for a brief stay at an earth-orbiting hotel.)aboard the lunar cruiser, bigelow boasts, \"the food should be as good as whatever carnival or princess lines offer today.\" partial gravity makes such fine dining possible; it should also be beneficial for showers and toilets. plans call for shuttles to deliver fresh food and retire waste at least twice a week. as much will be recycled as possible.from special viewing rooms, space tourists will get personal astronomy lessons as they watch heavenly bodies roll by. feeds from a raft of externally mounted telescopes will splash real-time images onto screens that cover the walls and ceilings. \"you'll have the feeling of standing on the bridge of the starship enterprise,\" bigelow says.__ zero-g playgrounds will be a big draw on the bigelow lunar cruiser. guests can strap on wings, or consult the outer-space kama sutra. __passengers will also peer into the craters and volcanoes on the mysterious dark side of the moon. when the ship flies by, cruising at 3,700 miles per hour, it will pass close enough - within 10 miles - for a special lighting system to illuminate the shadowy surface.still, the low-gravity playgrounds along the central portion of the craft will likely be one of the biggest draws. just about everyone will want a turn in the flying chamber, where, bennett explains, \"you would strap some wings on your arms, slap some tail feathers on your feet for stability, and fly like a bird under your own power.\"for the more earthy-minded, no one knows whether the kama sutra will need a new outer-space edition, but the sexual experiences are likely to be impossible to duplicate on earth. nasa remains understandably tight-lipped on the subject. as for the prospect of a moonglow \"massage\" - long a las vegas staple - bigelow does not plan to be steward of a lunar love boat.besides, bennett speculates, \"think about what that hooker would have to charge when her transportation cost is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\"bennett and bigelow share an unabashed love of science fiction; bennett even successfully writes it. and the bigelow aerospace vp is a space evangelist in his own right as founder and president of the artemis society, a self-proclaimed \"lunar underground\" hell-bent on colonizing the moon. bigelow, as it happens, is a contributor to the mars society.their common vision has taken root in the parched nevada landscape that 100 years ago accommodated only horned toads and yuccas. now, with abundant air-conditioning and piped-in water, las vegas is a top tourist destination for middle americans from coast to coast; its surroundings show some of the fastest growth in the country. it's hardly surprising that bigelow sees an analogy in transforming the desolate frontier of space. it may be improbable. but the entire city of las vegas is based on improbability. as long as they believe in a glittery future, entrepreneurs and gamblers will risk a lot - sometimes billions.\"the shipping industry, the automobile industry - those things are landlocked,\" bigelow says. \"i can't conceive of what the limits would possibly be for industries in space.\"bennett agrees. \"if we can build a translunar cruise ship,\" he says, \"there's no practical reason why you couldn't trade off some of your passenger complement for some more radiation shielding and some super-duper rocket loaders and fly this thing to mars.\" here's one sure vegas-style bet: people will pay a hell of a lot more to walk along the martian canals than the venetian's.more"}
