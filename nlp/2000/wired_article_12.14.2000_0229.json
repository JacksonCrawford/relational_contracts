all the while eavesdropping on their sister, mabel, and her lover, frederick: \"tomorrow it may pour again, (i hear the country wants some rain), yet people say, i know not why, that we shall have a warm july.\"in general, the weather may seem like a trivial, non-threatening topic of discussion when one is making polite conversation.but in states like wisconsin and minnesota, where temperatures can zigzag from the high 90s in august to subzero in january, predicting the weather is serious business.meteorologists at wkow-tv channel 27 weather central in madison, wisconsin, and wcco-tv channel 4 in minneapolis, minnesota have developed tools that bring precise neighborhood forecasts to internet users.weather gurus at both stations have formed companies \u2013 they are direct competitors \u2013 to market the tool to local broadcast stations around the country.\"it gives the average viewer the ability to receive a forecast that is specific to their location,\" said weather central chief meteorologist bob lindmeier. weather central launched myweather earlier this year. \"it's hour-by-hour. all the different weather variables are there: wind speed, wind chill, etcetera.\"net users can sign up for the my 27 microcast service on the homepage of the station, which creates a personalized web page with a street-level forecast and delivers weather updates to their inbox.myweather debuted my 27 microcast this fall on the channel 27 website. so far, the program has signed up over 11,000 viewers. the product will launch on other stations next year.\"there are a bunch of people who are enthusiasts about the weather \u2013 it's a larger part of the population than you would think,\" said matt peterson, president of myweather.the service uses higher-resolution mathematical models that are more accurate and precise than the national weather service, which uses zone forecasting.both myweather's microcast technology and digital cyclone's my-cast incorporate a set of datapoints that are closer together than the datapoints of the nws.\"when it comes to weather, it's not one size fits all,\" said paul douglas, chief meteorologist for wcco and the ceo of digital cyclone. \"i can't tell you the number of people that call me and say, 'paul, i don't live at the airport.'\"for example, he continued, \"today the northern suburbs (of the twin cities) are getting about 2 inches of snow, while the southern suburbs are only getting a dusting. i think it is important to capture that kind of neighborhood variation.\"my-cast is already live in 24 cities through local television or newspaper websites.weather central's lindmeier pointed out that the personal microcast can be an excellent supplement for what weathermen and women do on the air.\"the limitation i have as an on-air broadcaster is that i have three minutes to discuss the forecast for the whole area,\" he said. \"that's not enough time to cover janesville, portage and other cities and small towns.\"using the internet, local broadcast stations can retain their viewers and extend their brand into another medium, myweather's peterson said.the stations purchase and personalize the tool for their viewers, adding a picture of their local meteorologist, for example, and sending out daily e-mails with weather updates.\"generally, when you ask people where do you go for weather on the internet, the local station doesn't register in the top ten,\" peterson said. \"this is something that really bonds people to their local television station, which is the whole reason we're doing it.\"but a spokeswoman for weather.com, which garnered over eight million unique visitors per month, according to the most recent data from media metrix, is skeptical that users want and need such precise information.\"i don't think that for every community, giving (a) neighborhood forecast would add that much value versus a 10-day forecast,\" said jody fennell, the vice president and executive producer for weather.com. \"i'm not certain that it would be that dramatically different.\"currently, weather.com's users plug in their zip code to get a forecast for a particular city.fennell said that weather.com is developing features like forecast information for a mountaintop in vail in addition to the city itself, and forecasts for areas that have particularly drastic microclimates.next year, the company also plans to provide trend forecasts for 60 days out.nevertheless, fennell said, \"we'll certainly watch what weather central does and it's certainly something we could develop.\"both myweather and digital cyclone plan to expand their personal forecasts to wireless devices."}
