do you understand?\" katie writes, painfully remembering what her mother screamed at her.now a senior at st. paul's school, a boarding school in new hampshire, katie says writing about her molestation wasn't the worst part.\"that's not the part that really gets to me,\" she said. \"it's when i first went home and got no support. it brought me to tears to think about how my friends abandoned me ... and as weird as it sounds, i had just lost my best friend.\"victims like katie often lack support, says parry aftab, author of <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"externallink\",\"outgoingurl\":\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0071357521/cyberangelsorg/103-5608090-3231807\"}' href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0071357521/cyberangelsorg/103-5608090-3231807\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the parent's guide to protecting your kids in cyberspace</a> and director of internet safety group cyberangels. \"they get blamed a lot. it's not like someone reaches out from behind a bush and grabs them,\" she said.even now, katie still feels responsible for what happened to her. \"i did have somewhat of a brain,\" she said. \"i did know i was talking to a 23-year-old. i believe my mistake was corresponding with him. a 13\u2013year-old still does have responsibility.\"in march 1998, kufrovich pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months in jail.\"that's about typical,\" aftab said. \"it's truly sad. nobody is putting these guys in jail for the time they deserve.\"since kufrovich's sentencing, many more pedophiles have been caught and charged by the fbi, which has a special unit that goes after \"travelers,\" or pedophiles who cross state lines to meet and molest their young internet friends.in 1999, the fbi investigated about 1,500 such cases, almost twice as many as it had in 1998. since the feds began their \"innocent images\" program in 1995, just under 500 travelers have been arrested and 400 have been convicted.no one knows how many francis kufroviches are out there, on the net or off. but experts say the problem of internet pedophilia is growing.\"the problem with sex predators on the internet has exploded,\" said debbie mahoney, director of safeguarding our children and author of <a class=\"external-link\" data-event-click='{\"element\":\"externallink\",\"outgoingurl\":\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/1890613096/socum/103-5608090-3231807\"}' href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/1890613096/socum/103-5608090-3231807\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">innocence lost? protecting your child from the trauma of abuse</a>.mahoney, whose own son was molested, says pedophilia has slowly gained acceptance on the internet, and the days of lone men lurking in irc channels are over.\"now we have forums, websites, web rings, (consisting of) all admitted pedophiles. they give virtual high-fives to each other on the internet,\" she said.aftab estimates there are about 30,000 pedophile sites. \"with internet pedophiles, they can hang out in communities,\" she said. \"that's a big danger. they don't feel alienated, and they just feel like they're misunderstood.\"cyberangels gets about four requests a day for help about pedophiles luring children, she said.\"i know that i can go into a chat room as a 12-year-old and not say anything, and be hit on and asked if i'm a virgin within two minutes,\" she said. \"it's a much bigger problem than anyone can imagine. in the olden days, you either had to know the kids, molest your own ... or you had to stand on a playground corner.\"but kids are getting smart about that, so (predators) don't like exposing themselves.\"the internet, she said, has made it much easier for predators who can remain more anonymous.\"offline you get all different batches, but it's only the cream of the crop that does it on the internet,\" she said, explaining that the profile of a traveler is a white, middle-aged, technologically savvy, educated, upper-class man -- precisely the kind of guy judges historically have a hard time throwing in jail, she says.katie's molester is now out of jail. his lawyers have said kufrovich won't comment on the book because he was not given an advance copy.katie laughs in disbelief.\"they called and said, 'you know, this is not good timing for him, he's getting married.' i'm like, 'sorry.'\"(editor's note: the title of the book is not affiliated with another website that uses the katie.com domain.)see also: hackers' new tack on kid pornsee also: hackers' new tack on kid pornsee also: kids' privacy an act, or action?see also: kids' privacy an act, or action?"}
