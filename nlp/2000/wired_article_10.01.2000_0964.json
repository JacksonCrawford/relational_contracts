is this great, or what? - the frame glows in the dark.the mn02 will light up the aisles of selected us stores this fall; it's one of two bikes created by industrial design sensation marc newson for biomega (www.biomega.dk), the small danish company whose mission seems to be turning bikes into art objects that look almost too pretty to ride. both the mn02 and its brushed-aluminum brother, the mn01 extravaganza, carry the streamlined design of a concept car at the detroit auto show. but unlike those four-wheeled optimistic visions, which shed nearly every stylistic innovation on the way to the assembly line, the biomega bikes are here and now, seemingly teleported from some alternate universe that takes its cue from 2001: a space odyssey.biomega's model rl01 (also known as the biolove and still in development) is slated to be unveiled in milan in april 2001, hitting us stores by summer. created by london-based \"organic\" designer and studio x director ross lovegrove, the rl01 is less space-age than the mn series but just as stunning: the frame looks like a silver praying mantis. designed for easy transport up and down narrow stairwells, its pedals and handlebars fold upward, which also makes it easy to hang flat against the wall like a work of art (wall hook included). the saddle can be gracefully raised and lowered by an aeron-style gas-filled cylinder. the 14-gear system is enclosed in a hermetically sealed, oil-filled unit that eliminates dirt-caked chains and grease-stained legs.obviously, these bikes aren't much use to spandex warriors. sure, biomega cycles incorporate the best components and materials borrowed from the aerospace industry (both hallmarks of high-performance cycling), but their main appeal is to urban hipsters who probably don't know the difference between a derailleur and a freehub, the kind of people who would rather ride an aston martin db v than a mountain bike.__form follows fetish: the weld-free frame is joined by permabond esp110, the epoxy used to bond jet-engine mounts on the thrust supersonic car. __\"these guys are trying to push the image of bikes and create a lifestyle product,\" says rico zorkendorfer, a senior designer in the san francisco office of id firm ideo. \"they've reversed the creation process - now design is driving the geometry of the frame, pushing it into new production methods.\"\"the mn01 implies a change of the rules,\" adds jonathan ive, the vp of industrial design at apple who helped reinvent computer style with the imac.so far, the biomega approach - call it form follows function follows fetishism - seems to have struck a chord. the \u20ac5,500 mn01 debuted in europe in late may and earned $300,000 in the first month. sales of the mn02 (with a \u20ac3,500 price tag) hit $150,000 during the same period.\"one customer bought the mn02 without any intention of ever riding it,\" notes greg krum of the new york design shop moss, in soho. the san francisco museum of modern art is in the process of acquiring a newson-designed bike, presumably not for transportation purposes. and the pompidou centre in paris has an mn01 on display, as does the carnegie museum of art in pittsburgh, which plans to include it in aluminum by design: jewelry to jets, an exhibition that opens this month.no surprise, then, that when the chic london furniture shop scp was burgled last june, the thieves took the biomegas and left everything else.one of the first things biomega cofounder jens martin skibsted will tell you about the company is that the name was not chosen because it sounds ergonomically correct. it's simply a visual pun: <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/archive/wired/images/biomega.gif\"/> looks a little like a bike, if you stand on your head and squint.a gregarious, athletically built 30-year-old, skibsted launched the company two years ago with former university classmate elias grove nielsen, also 30. inspired by the modernist architecture he saw on a trip to barcelona in 1991, skibsted began filling notebooks with sketches of fanciful bicycles, like one with an x-shaped frame and back-wheel steering. after earning a ba in philosophy, skibsted spent a couple years running an art gallery and a record label in copenhagen before he decided to turn his sketchbooks into a business plan. early in the spring of 1998, skibsted talked nielsen into helping him roll out the wheel-based venture.with seed money from family and the sale of nielsen's sandwich business, the two set up shop in hellerup, a fashionable beach town on the outskirts of copenhagen. even now, with the newson bikes on the market and other models in development, biomega is a five-person office that outsources everything, from bookkeeping to manufacturing - most of which happens in the uk. the frames are made in worcester and bonded in weston-super-mare, and the bikes are assembled in birmingham.from the start, skibsted knew that he didn't want to work with designers from the bike world, because he felt they'd be too conventional. he wanted product designers like marc newson, the australian-born, london-based 36-year-old whose creations are influenced by the plastic furniture of the '60s and '70s, the silly putty style of vernor panton and eero aarnio. skibsted was also drawn by newson's streak of irreverence - he's famous for his novel use of materials and fabrication techniques. his embryo chair is upholstered in wet-suit fabric, and his blackhole table is made of carbon fiber.soon after the handshake formation of biomega, an acquaintance of skibsted's named paul hughes offered to arrange a meeting with newson, with the warning that the designer's schedule was insanely full and that they should be prepared to jump on a plane at a moment's notice. days later, hughes called to say that newson had a few hours to meet them in two days' time in milan, where he'd be attending a conference. skibsted spent the next 48 hours cutting out magazine photographs of bikes and cars, then assembling collage concepts of what a biomega bike might look like.when skibsted, nielsen, and hughes got to the hotel in milan, newson's manager escorted them to a patio where the designer sat with a supermodel at his side, along with the rest of his entourage and a film crew from the australian bbc that was shooting a documentary about him. in this fellini-esque atmosphere, skibsted made the pitch. money almost scuttled the deal, but the danish partners bumped up their offer, sweetening the pot with a generous per-unit royalty. after a few weeks of interoffice back-and-forthing, newson accepted.ross lovegrove - a 42-year-old designer whom skibsted admires for his recyclable molded-plastic chairs as well as, more recently, his giorgio armani perfume bottles and the first-class cabin of japan airlines - was an easier sell. it was late 1999 and lovegrove was sitting in a london caf\u00e9 eating breakfast when he discovered he'd forgotten his wallet. he was about to confess to the waitress that he didn't have any money when a stranger approached him. the man, another skibsted friend, had been trying to contact lovegrove for weeks to pitch the biomega project.\"look,\" said lovegrove. \"i'll do it on one condition: buy me breakfast.\"__\"how can i go from designing airline interiors to soap to bicycles? i fly three times a week, i use soap every night, and i need a bike, goddammit!\" __skibsted's instruction to newson was to \"explore the limits of bike design\"; newson responded with a proposal to construct the frames out of two ultrathin aluminum shells formed by a high-temperature superplastic process and bonded with epoxy.it wasn't just an attempt at novelty; it was a way to not build a bike in the traditional manner, by welding tubes together. newson says he pressed the hesitant skibsted to let him take the chance. \"if we don't try other ways, we'll only move forward in the same direction.\"anxious about the bonding process, skibsted was referred by the danish technological institute to a materials engineer at saab. she told skibsted to go with permabond esp110, the durable epoxy resin used to bond the jet-engine mounts of the thrust ssc (a supersonic car that broke the world land speed record in 1997). biomega hired gkn westland helicopters, a british manufacturer, to test the strength of the bonding, and sent the first prototype to efbe, an independent company in germany that tests and rates bicycles. the successful results of these tests satisfied biomega, but survirn engineering, the firm hired to assemble the frames, was unwilling to bear the risk of using permabond, saying the process still hadn't been adequately tested for the kinds of dynamic loads a bike frame undergoes. the company insisted that if biomega wanted epoxy-bonded frames, then biomega would have to accept them with no guarantee.ultimately, skibsted and nielsen agreed to this condition; they realized that if they wanted to build a company based on design, they couldn't be constrained by timid engineering choices. the designers had to be given free rein.\"i approached both bikes as an exercise in joining the dots,\" newson says, \"and looked for the simplest form that was able to do this, to connect the headset to either the bottom bracket or seat and then to the rear wheel. also, it was of huge importance to me to lose all the superfluous shit and hide all the ugly bits, like the cables.\"like newson, lovegrove had never designed a bicycle, but was intrigued by the challenge. \"it's a bit of a fallacy that if you want a flashlight design you've got to find a flashlight designer,\" he says. \"how can i go from designing airline interiors to soap to bicycles? well, the fact is, i fly three times a week, i use soap every night, and i need a bike, goddammit!\"lovegrove's design in progress for the rl01 incorporates the same bonded superplastic aluminum of the newson frames (which the danish technological institute has now officially approved). the frame has a delicate simplicity - the sprockets and gears are hidden within, and the macho power-ride features of a mountain bike are absent. because the biolove can be hung on the living room wall, lovegrove had to think about safety. \"the last thing you want is a 5-year-old child taking hold of the pedal, whizzing it around, and cutting his finger off on the cog,\" he says. \"so i've gone for a chainless direct-drive transmission.\"when the biolove project is finished, lovegrove plans to design a pack-flat bicycle (think ikea), and after that, a plastic bike - \"the imac bike for the world.\"newson has signed on for another project, and skibsted has had initial conversations with \"new simplicity\" hotshot jasper morrison, a londoner who has designed everything from salad servers to a light-rail train. in the meantime, skibsted's mind is still bursting with ideas, including one notable long-term project: a bike for use at the lunar hilton, a far-fetched but serious proposal to build a hotel on the moon.\"we have a whole file on it,\" says skibsted, rattling off some of the unique requirements for a two-wheeled crater cruiser. \"you can't fill the tires with air. they have to be designed not to sink in the sand. with no atmosphere, the grease would evaporate, so all systems have to be internal. and it has to be very lightweight, because of the cost of sending it to the moon.\"chances are, he'd find plenty of buyers on earth, even with a sky-high price. a lunar bike wouldn't be rideable here - it would be flattened by a gravitational pull that's six times stronger than the moon's. but hey, it would look great on a wall."}
