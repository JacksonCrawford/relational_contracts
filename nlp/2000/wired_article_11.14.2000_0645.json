the edges are charred.\"the teams had the added problem of having to decipher the text without damaging the very frail parchment. \"we can't remove material from the palimpsest,\" said johns hopkins' bill christens-barry. \"it's very fragile, so we can't go into it or get in contact with it, so we have to use benign techniques.\"christens-barry's team used three main techniques to decipher the palimpsest. the first was multi-spectral imaging. \"this involves the use of a very high-resolution digital camera together with a series of optical filters that allowed us to take images that broke up the visible light spectrum into a number of very narrow bands,\" he said.the team also used ultraviolet light to measure both the amount and wavelengths of the florescent emissions, which allowed them to build a 3-d matrix of data or a \"spectral fingerprint\" of the original ink.the second technique used was confocal microscopy, a technology more commonly used to probe the structure of cells in, among other things, cancer research.\"the unique capability of the confocal microscope is that it's able to do optical sectioning,\" christens-barry said. \"it allows you to look in depth into the object and isolate a single layer while ignoring everything above and below it.\"this technique allowed the team to build up a record of the object as a 3-d object. \"it's sort of a non-contact archeology in which we've looked at the deposition of different strata of the palimpsest,\" he said.in the third technique, the johns hopkins team examined light emitted by a fluorescent process, in which they looked at the amounts of light given off by the parchment.the ink used in the original archimedes text was iron gall ink, which is acidic and therefore corrodes the parchment. \"in doing so, it modifies some of the molecules, the proteins and fats in the parchment so that when those molecules are excited by ultraviolet wavelengths the fluorescence they give off vary somewhat in color,\" christens-barry said.the clarity of the results achieved by the johns hopkins team depended on the quality of the page. \"we only get a crystal-clear image when we're lucky. not only is the ink gone, but also there has been some diffusion of what was there in these residues -- so it's kind of smudged,\" he said.some sections of the text have been lost forever. \"fortunately, there is a lot of context in greek, so that finding anything at all often makes it very easy for scholars to understand what the text refers to,\" christens-barry said.the rit team visited the walters gallery to take photographs of the five pages, also using a digital camera. the camera takes images in 1,536 x 1,024 pixels.\"the camera has a little refrigerator,\" said roger easton jr., a professor at chester f. carlson center for imaging at rit. \"because it keeps the sensor cool you can get more gray levels. we can get 4,096 gray levels where most digital cameras only get 256.\"easton believes that, with a higher resolution camera, his team would be able to produce a fairly clear deciphering of the archimedes text. \"i'd be very hesitant to say that we would get all of it ... but i think we've got a good chance of seeing some of it.\"the walters is still in the process of deciding which of the two teams, if either, will be awarded the project. \"both teams did a truly spectacular job,\" noel said.despite the excitement generated by the research, scientists realize the project will take years. \"the scholars are drooling over this,\" christens-barry said. \"we've waited over 2,000 years to learn some of what archimedes was thinking and there will be one chance to do it and we want to make sure we take our time and do it correctly.\""}
