offices in central europe and asia are quietly trying to plug the brain drain that's siphoning technical talent to the united states by offering to pay for the education of their best and brightest applicants.the catch: students have to attend local schools and then work in their home countries for a specified period of time after graduation.the united states is still the most popular destination for foreign students, drawing about 578,000 in the 1998-99 academic year, according to the department of states international information programs.but the number of foreign students attending college in the united states has been dwindling, according to siip. five years ago, about 40 percent of all international students studied in the united states. today, it's 32 percent.the decline is attributed to aggressive recruiting problems in students' own countries and in others, especially in the computer science fields. the high cost of tuition at american colleges and universities is also to blame.u.s. schools are battling back.president clinton recently suggested that \"educational institutions, state and local governments, non-governmental organizations, and the business community\" should \"review the effect of u.s. government actions on the international flow of students and scholars as well as on citizen and professional exchanges, and take steps to address unnecessary obstacles, including those involving visa and tax regulations, procedures, and policies.\"in response, the immigration and naturalization service has eased work rules for foreign students. and some colleges are considering adjusting the amount of funds made available for grants to foreign students in order to fill in the gaps caused by weak exchange rates.it may not be enough. international students increasingly are being tempted with offers of free education and guaranteed jobs after graduation if they attend school in their own countries.mark pataki, 21, from nagykanizsa, hungary, had seriously considered attending school in the united states. he has family in the united states and he speaks english fluently, so the transition would be an easy one.he looked into programs such as the one offered by new york university, which partnered with citibank to offer \"citiassist global,\" a web-based private loan program specifically for international students.but then the hungarian branch of general electric made him an offer he couldn't refuse: the company would pay for pataki to attend college if he agreed to work for them while he was in school and for four years after graduation.\"we have shortage of qualified it experts here in hungary, as everywhere else in the world, so the government and the big corporations do everything they can to get educated and/or talented people. it's a compromise -- you get the education, and eventually they will get more money,\" pataki said.wilhelm brinck-schmitt, 19, of hamburg, germany, said he has been offered a similar deal by intel.\"european technology companies are trying very hard to keep people in their own silicon valleys,\" brinck-schmitt said. \"they know that once you leave, chances are you won't come back.\"still, many computer science students are drawn to colleges in the united states.\"we have an incredible variety of immigrants here at the university,\" said professor wise young of rutgers keck collaborative science center. \"a stroll along the campus is like a visit to the united nations. it is wonderful.\"young, who was born in china, raised in japan, and educated in the united states, said that rutgers doesn't offer special programs to attract international students. rutgers does attempt to make applying as easy as possible, and, once a student is accepted, to help them adjust to their new home by offering counseling on everything from local customs to immigration issues.xu cheng, 27, who studied computer science at rutgers, said he's glad he passed on government-sponsored school scholarships at home in china to attend college in the united states.\"i think many people involved with technology will eventually want to work in the united states, at least for a little while,\" cheng said. \"there's a lure to america that is hard to resist. and for students who aren't comfortable with the language or culture here, a student visa gives you time to adjust. if you come and go right to work, you feel more pressured.\"despite that, pataki plans to come to the united states only after he completes his schooling and fulfills his obligation to general electric.\"beyond the fact that my schooling is being paid for, i believe the education i will get in hungary will be better. typically hungarian schools place more rigorous demands on students than schools in america,\" he said.but pataki feels that his employment opportunities will be greater in the states simply because \"the u.s. is a bigger country, so there's more work.\"and even more important, pataki says, is his feeling that the united states is at the epicenter of technology.\"anyone who wants to work with computers craves new things,\" he said. \"and all the revolutions always start from america.\""}
