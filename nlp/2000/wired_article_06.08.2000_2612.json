(yet) that's a pyrrhic victory: the case goes back to jackson, he holds hearings, and you get the same outcome.\"microsoft has 30 days to file a notice of appeal. here's where it gets complicated: microsoft will ask jackson to stay his order, the government has seven days to oppose it, and jackson will presumably deny it shortly thereafter.once jackson denies microsoft's request for a stay, then the company can finally go to the appeals court and ask them to block jackson's order and block further proceedings before him.justice department lawyers could ask the solicitor general to in turn ask jackson to certify the case for a direct appeal to the supreme court. that would use the expediting act, a federal law that provides for speedy outcomes in important cases.then, if the case goes to the supreme court, microsoft likely will ask the justices to halt wednesday's order if neither jackson nor the appeals court has done so."}
