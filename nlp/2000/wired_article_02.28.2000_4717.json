germany -- cebit may be more media event than anything, as exhibitors are quick to acknowledge, but in some sense europe's largest internet and computer trade fair succeeds or fails based on what visitors think. a random sampling of interviews with weekend visitors to cebit suggested the thriving, ever-expanding event is offering just the sort of mind-bending sensory overload it promises, though many felt it could benefit from a sharper organizing theme or concept.\"at the moment it's a bit here and a bit there,\" said cagil koyuncu cq, a 29-year-old from dusseldorf. \"i think in the future it will take one direction more.... i haven't found the extraordinary technical development yet. everything seems kind of on the border.\"koyuncu, who works in software development for hewlett packard but was not working at the show, may have been a tougher critic than most, but she represents a core part of the cebit constituency. she found much to praise, but noted, \"there's nothing where i say 'whoa!' or 'this is what it's going to be in the future.'\"each year there are more people from more countries visiting the massive hannover messe exhibition space during cebit's weeklong run. through saturday of this year, cebit had drawn a record 320,000 visitors, up from 303,000 after three days last year.that puts cebit on track to break 700,000 in total attendance for the first time, an impressive feat for a event that started in 1970 with just 60,900 total visitors, more than 90 percent of them german.\"it's too much to see,\" said christian menke, who works for a local software company. \"you know you can't see everything, and after a while you kind of....\" menke rolled his eyes into the back of his head to finish the thought.he and friend nico heise were wearing 3-d glasses near a large high-definition screen, getting an enhanced view of a boeing 747 taking off, among other dramatic images. the display was the work of boston-based ptc, a business-to-business e-commerce specialist.\"he has to explain everything to me, because i'm an auto mechanic and this is hard for me to understand,\" said heise.the two young men said that people-watching was half the fun of working their way through the huge crowds. they were pleased with the number of companies that seemed to make a point of putting tall women with attention-getting looks in front of their displays.they liked the insane variety of it all, but mostly they liked the impact of the technology on the young.\"the best part is watching the kids look at something and say 'wow,'\" said menke.given its huge crowds and the lack of much else going on hannover, cebit takes over the city completely. the influx of computer-types so alters the landscape that even germans out for a beer at a local night spot speak to each other in halting english first -- only later realizing they are all german speakers.the event promises to keep getting larger each year, especially with chancellor gerhard schroeder making an issue of technology as an economic engine.but it might have to work to avoid getting too big.\"it's great, but it's too big,\" said erwin urrutia, an architect from bogota, colombia. \"we want to find a small digital camera for our computer. they have everything here, but it's too much. my feet can't take it.\"germany has embraced the internet and related technologies this year with a newfound gusto. if this enthusiasm is going to translate into a bright future of innovation and fresh ideas, it will come down to the contributions of people like nina and anne cleven, high school students from near dusseldorf. they spent the weekend at cebit and were bursting with new ideas afterward.\"sometimes people didn't want to explain things to us because they thought we wouldn't understand,\" said nina, 17.\"but usually if we kept after them, they would explain,\" said anne, 18. \"it's amazing to see that all these things are possible, like you see in a james bond movie.\"the sisters especially liked gadgetry like what they saw at a display by nixdorf of how you could use a mobile phone to work the controls in your house from anywhere.\"you can move the shades in your windows up and down,\" said anne.\"or you can turn your lights on and off -- even if you are on holiday in italy,\" said nina.but the cleven sisters, who said they probably spend about six hours a week online, were as impressed with the downside of the technology on display at cebit as the exciting sense of possibility.\"i'm a bit shocked that you can connect everything in one piece of equipment, your mobile phone,\" said anne. \"you lose contact with people.\"added her sister: \"it becomes sterile.\""}
