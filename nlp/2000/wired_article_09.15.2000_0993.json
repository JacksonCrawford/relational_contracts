australia -- after ticketing mess-ups, bribery scandals and doping controversies it was, quite simply, the arrival of the greatest show on earth. the 2000 summer olympics began here friday night, in a city that can now kick back and watch the athletes following its own multi-year marathon of dodging cement mixers, road closures and security drills as the city geared itself up for the microscopic attention of 3.5 billion television watchers.the centerpiece of the opening ceremony at the spanking new 110,000-seat outdoor stadium australia was an eye-catching rendition of australia's past and present, played out across the clam-shell-shaped stadium's expansive grounds redecorated in ochre outback colors.during a one-hour performance, 12,500 performers included horsemen, swirling acrobats on wires and metal-bashing tap dancers keeping up a tempo that would have done a 100-meter dash proud.in all, the program covered australia's aboriginal pre-history, the arrival of english explorer capt. james cook, the nation's rural pastoral age, and the demographically-defining arrival of post world war ii migrants followed by today's \"lucky country\" beachside suburban complacency.as theater and australian introductory cultural textbook, it was arguably the most coherent statement of national identity this cluster of 18 million people has ever put together.without a doubt, the high point was the final number, called \"arrivals,\" in which performers were serenaded by a sea of waving flashlights helpfully placed on every seat in the stadium. the accompaniment of the performers by tens of thousands of speckled starbursts in the stands virtually levitated the stadium.it was a dramatic show of enthusiasm for the waves of immigration-induced multi-cultural awakenings this country has experienced since the late 1940s. all this was big stuff for a small, adolescent nation still so unclear about its place in the world many residents can only ambivalently mumble their way through the national anthem, \"advance australia fair.\"following the electrifying opening ceremony performance came the arrival of athletes.during a nearly hour-long procession of nations, a somewhat sheepish american software billionaire bill gates -- hidden in the stands somewhere -- was caught momentarily on the stadium's massive television screen waiving a flag for the u.s. team. the crowd roared in celebrity-welcoming approval.though gates was cheering on his countrymen, he must have approved the way the australians opened the games with nary a glitch.the best news out of friday night was that all the toilets flushed, the power stayed on and the trains and buses ran on time.now faced with the choking challenge of continually moving tens of thousands of people around the city, sydney heaved a sigh of relief when games' first major logistical hurdle was cleared.in friday morning's edition's of the iconoclastic sydney morning herald, columnist david marr summed up the city's mentality perfectly.\"we love hits and winners: horses, painters, football team, politicians, lovers, even crooks. but the long haul of loyalty isn't for us,\" he wrote. \"we've watched with only half an eye the stadiums go up and the blood spilt at socog (the sydney organizing committee for the olympic games), but now that we're sniffing a winner the games have our full attention. that's sydney in its bones.\"that spirit was embodied by australia governor-general sir william deane, who officially opened the games in a non-descript style that belied controversies surrounding his appearance.first, he snubbed speaking french, the protocol language of olympic games openings.secondly, his ceremonial role in opening the games as representative of australia's head of state, england's queen elizabeth, underscored the nationally divisive issue of whether australia should become a republic.oddly, during the dazzling, multi-media entr\u00e9e to the australian mindset, there was nary a nod, wink or momentary acknowledgement of australia's true european beginnings.in 1789, australia was initially settled by europeans as dumping ground for england's convict class after america deprived the mother country of that privilege in 1776.this is significant, because australia's convict past is often viewed here as one of the biggest differences between aussies and yanks. since america fought england to become independent, the united states is often viewed here as being built on a higher-level of personal hustle and commercial drive.for their part, australians tend to view themselves as making up for lost time under the whips and chains in the early days by the pursuit of present-day sybaritic outdoor pleasures best captured in that immortal marketing line: \"put another shrimp on the barbie, mate.\"in short: aussies work to live -- not the other way around. but who could fault australia, after nearly us$4 billion in preparation, some glossy historical omissions during its opening moment in the global spotlight?after two centuries of marginalization by \"tyranny of distance,\" congenial australians are now ready for the \"tyranny of scrutiny\" by the world's television cameras."}
