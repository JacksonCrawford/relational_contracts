a wilted garden.com on page 94; and drinks.com (page 72); bigwords.com (52); and furniture.com (93), all of which have just closed their doors.another guide just published by the ratings service gomez, is also guilty of some sins of commission. indeed, in anticipation of a dot-com downturn, gomez marked some sites with an asterisk, explaining that, wall street being as fickle as it is, some sites weren't guaranteed.when contacted for comment, both bizrate and gomez defended their books in the obvious manner: yes, they said, print is slower and more permanent than the web -- are you surprised?\"at the bottom of each page, it says, 'log on to bizrate.com,'\" said bizrate ceo chuck davis, who suggested that consumers know the web, by the very nature of the medium, is more up-to-date than print.and of course, he's right. it isn't really big news that the printed guides, which are now at bookstores, include a few sites that are no longer around. that problem's to-be-expected in an industry as volatile as e-commerce. and in both gomez's and bizrate's defense, it's worth noting that there are just a few dead sites in a list of hundreds that are still up-and-running.what is interesting about these dead dots showing up in the guides, though, are the high ratings they were given by both bizrate and gomez.of all the pet-supply sites monitored by gomez, pets.com was ranked the highest, earning a score of 7.70 on a 10-point scale. bizrate gives pets.com an 8.7 and reported that one consumer said the site had \"excellent selection.\" another consumer told bizrate that orders arrived on time and were accurate.it's the same story with other defunct sites. furniture.com gets a 7.5 rating from bizrate, with the praise of, \"the prices couldn't be beat.\" the no. 1 site in gomez's furniture category is living.com, with an 8.32 overall rating. but you guessed it -- living is also dead.so why are the best sites dying so young?\"consumers seem to love the selection and prices of these sites,\" bizrate's davis said. \"but sometimes what consumers want is at odds with the investors.\"it's a classic failed-business story, really. the companies spent all of their funding on promoting their sites and improving customer experience. and the money seems to have worked -- people started liking their services. but not enough people, and not in time. the funding dried up, and the sites had to be killed.\"it's all very sad,\" said barbara kasser, author of the internet shopping yellow pages, 2001 edition another print shopping guide.she said that during the four months she took to write the book, she spent a lot of her time speaking to the people who run e-commerce sites.\"what we really forget sometimes is that there are living, breathing people behind these sites -- there is someone there,\" she said. which makes the recent dot-com shake-up so upsetting, she said.\"i mean, garden.com -- who would have guessed it about that site?\" she said. \"i shopped there myself.\"kasser's guide is decidedly more unscientific than bizrate's or gomez's. instead of using consumer surveys, like the other companies, kasser visited each site herself and spoke to its employees.this gave her, she said, a \"personal connection\" to the e-commerce sites. writing up each of the 1,700 site descriptions in the book, she said, was one of the most fun things she's ever done in her writing career.of course, though, she also had to be weary of dying dots. \"i checked www.dotcomfailures.com a lot,\" she said.perhaps to avoid the embarrassment of listing a dot-com that, given the nasdaq, might fail tomorrow, some other holiday shopping guides this year are product-based: cnet, zdnet and my simon all decided to list cool stuff to buy, not cool places to shop.among these, my simon's list seems the most diverse, listing the relatively predictable hot buys, such as dvd players, to some really cool things you'd probably never find in a store.this isn't to say, though, that there isn't room for the printed shopping guides that are already at bookstores. amazon has re-ordered bizrate's guide, which means that, despite its few errors, there are still people out there who like to buy books about shopping online.\"that's why we printed the guide,\" davis said. \"we've got a lot of consumers coming online for the first time this holiday, and they need confidence to buy online.\"and if the books are no longer correct in a few months, what's the big deal? as alan alper, an analyst at gomez said, the book can still function as \"a snapshot of what internet shopping was like, circa 2000.\""}
