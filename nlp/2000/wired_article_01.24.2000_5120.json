voters anymore. the internet is the only way to go now. by lakshmi chaudhry.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "security", "type": "article", "timestamp": "01.24.2000 03:00 AM", "text": "the harris poll, one of the oldest names in the political survey business, is throwing phone books out the window and going fully online for the 2000 campaign.harris is the first company to rely entirely on the internet in the high-stakes game of predicting election outcomes. polling online has been considered particularly risky because of the thorny issues involved in using internet samples to extrapolate results for the general us population.but political pollsters claim internet surveys are quick, cheap, and -- gasp! -- accurate.harris will be offering comprehensive polling at the national and state levels beginning in june, said election 2000 director jonathan seigel. also, harris will conduct three pre-election polls in all 50 states this fall, including state and national \"outcome 2000\" polls to be conducted two days before election day in november.and all these surveys will be conducted entirely over the internet using samples culled from a database of 5 million respondents.traditionally, polling firms get a list of residential phone numbers and dial at random to generate a statistically valid sample, said george terhanian, vice president of internet research. the first six digits of a telephone number (area code and prefix) are selected to allow for every region to be well represented, while the remaining four digits are dialed at random.\"the problem is that there is no such registry [of email addresses] on the internet, which makes it difficult to get random samples,\" terhanian said.and the rules on the internet discourage unsolicited mass emailing which is considered spam, he said.harris resolved this problem by building a database of 5 million \"cooperative respondents,\" or people who have agreed to be surveyed on a regular basis.terhanian said the company built its database through partnerships with television shows, internet access companies like excite, and online advertising agencies. for example, a person signing up for free email can say whether or not they want participate in online surveys, he said.but political pollsters are skeptical about drawing a sample from a pre-existing database.\"there is a pre-selection bias because your sample is based on people who've agreed to be part of panel,\" said mark allen, a republican pollster with market strategies. \"it's not random. it's self-directed.\"but the larger problem with online polling is getting statistically accurate results, experts say. a 1999 jupiter communications study says only 48 percent of all americans had internet access at home. the average net user also looks nothing like the average american.\"they're just too white, too rich, and too male,\" allen said.and the demographic disparity is particularly worrisome in older segments of the population, who are also more likely to vote. \"if you look at the general us population, 17 percent are 65 or older, but that group is only 6 percent on the net,\" said terhanian.harris says it can adjust for such discrepancies through \"weighting.\" the solution is to oversample those segments of the population that are underrepresented online. \"we give less weight to the answers of typical net users\" and more weight to the answers of people who are less typical, said terhanian.the harris methodology, however, has its fair share of critics.\"what they do is take some poor black person who happens to be on the internet and count him 10 times,\" university of pennsylvania communications professor w. russell neuman said. \"it's taking a sample of convenience and using statistical controls to make it more representative.\"weighting can have an impact, but there will always be people who are not represented, allen said.harris defends its techniques by pointing to the results. for the past two years, the company has been conducting parallel internet and telephone surveys, asking the same question at the same time, terhanian said. \"and we've found few, if any, differences in the information.\"the company suffered a major embarrassment during the 1998 elections when it incorrectly predicted the gubernatorial race in mississippi. seigel admits internet surveys are less effective in southern states with large rural black populations. \"that's why we're not doing polls in every state,\" he said.but harris is confident that it has fixed the problems that caused the 1998 snafu, and will not be conducting parallel phone surveys to ensure accuracy in 2000.harris is one of the few polling firms to work entirely online. most of the other big names in polling, including gallup and roper, have stayed away from the internet due to sampling problems.and that's why harris' competitor intersurvey, which is also an online polling firm, collects its samples the old-fashioned way -- over the telephone.\"we select people through random-digit dialing and then provide them with webtv,\" intersurvey ceo doug rivers said. \"this way we don't miss people who are not computer users.\"the company provides all respondents with equipment -- even those with computers at home -- and sends them questions via email.intersurvey and harris interactive are betting that the future of polling is on the internet because it's getting more difficult to get a representative sample even with phone interviews, neuman said.most polling firms tend to call between 6-9 p.m. to maximize the breadth of their sample. \"people don't want to spend five to 20 minutes answering questions during dinner time,\" neuman said. \"they're getting tired of it.\"that's why response rates have declined steadily from about 80 percent to 30 percent over the past decade, he said.not only is an internet survey less intrusive, it's also quick. intersurvey will conduct an instant poll following the state of the union address for cbs news next week. rivers said the results will be available within 30 minutes.and without interviewer costs it becomes a lot cheaper for the client, he added.but for now, most party and candidate pollsters are still reluctant to go entirely online.allen, the republican party pollster, admits internet surveys are attractive, but does not recommend them as a solitary source. \"i may use them to get a quick take on an ad or a slogan,\" he said. \"but i have not seen anyone put all their energies into doing just online polling.\"\"it's kind of hard for people to make the jump. it's going to take a major educational effort,\" harris director seigel admitted.the initial reluctance may also disappear as more households get online. \"right now, it's too early to go entirely online,\" neuman said. \"harris is pushing the envelope. but you have to give them credit for bravely going ahead.\""}
