(but) there are girls out there now, it's starting to come up now,\" said bucky lasek, last year's x games gold medalist in vert skateboarding.but segovia said that discouragement from males has led to a lack of female interest in extreme sports.women aren't participating \"because they've been told by guys, their brothers, and parents, 'don't get hurt, that's too rough of a sport,'\" she said.one x games skateboarder seemed to confirm this attitude.\"i wouldn't want my fianc\u00e9 to be skating with me that much because i wouldn't want her shins all bashed up,\" said willy santos. but he admitted feeling \"psyched\" whenever he sees female skaters.x games inline competitor fabiola da silva said that girls need to overcome their societal gender roles and just go for it.\"i don't like it when girls say, 'oh i'm a girl.' i'm like, 'shut the hell up just go and try,' you know?\" said da silva, one of the world's top female inline skaters.segovia said that it's crucial for mainstream events like the x games to get parents interested by showing female extreme sports athletes.\"the more we're doing these things in the public eye, eventually this will evolve to become a 'normal' sport like soccer,\" she said.letting young girls see fellow females in action is necessary for them to overcome discouragement and their own intimidation, she added. \"it's so important for the girls to have somebody to look up to,\" said pro skateboarder jen o'brien. \"if they have someone out there blowin' up and it's a girl, it'll make such a gnarly impact on them and they'll say, 'yeah, i can do this.' it really helps to have role models to look up to.\"\"having specific contests or divisions for the girls or women-specific gear tells the girls, 'hey, this is for you,'\" segovia added. \"if they don't having anything out there for them, they're gonna feel ostracized.\"while the gender disparity in the summer x games continues, the female extreme sports movement is making significant progress.the first all girls skate jam took place in san diego in 1997 and has expanded to events in rhode island, hawaii, and spain.not long after the first agsj, the 1998 north american skateboard championships in vancouver, aka the slam city jam, became the first professional skateboarding contest to include a women's category.recently, the vans triple crown of skateboarding tour included a women's division, and includes the slam city jam contest.segovia points to snowboarding as an example of what can happen if companies start taking notice of the grrrl scene.eight years ago, the snowboarding media didn't showcase female riders, she said. but one snowboard company made a pro model that unleashed an avalanche of women's snowboarding gear.last year's winter x games, espn's winter extreme sports counterpart, had an almost equal proportion of men's and women's divisions due to the high number of snowboarding events.\"once those pro models came out, girls were like, 'i should be doing this sport.' before this, it was untouchable, no one made girl-specific gear,\" segovia said.in the meantime, supporters of women's extreme sports are optimistic that the movement continues to chug along.\"it's happening for the girls too -- it's happening slowly but surely,\" segovia said. \"we're not going anywhere. we're gonna be here for a long time. these girls are tough.\""}
