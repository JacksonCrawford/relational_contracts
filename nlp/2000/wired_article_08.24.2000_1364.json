the municipalities can either decide to pass the fee on to citizens in the form of \"convenience fees,\" or they can pay the fee themselves, in the hope that the money they save in efficiency will pay for the service.most of the governments have elected to charge a convenience fee, trimble said.ezgov has also tried its hand at more significant victories. it turns out that in the e-government world, states -- which handle the most lucrative interactions with citizens and business -- are the real cash cows.but at the state level, ezgov has met fierce competition from the national information consortium, or nic.the company is one of the oldest e-government firms, already handling the websites for 12 states. nic builds a so-called \"portal site\" for each state free of charge to the state; the site provides complete electronic accessibility to all state functions.rich phillips, nic's director of corporate communications, said that 5 percent of the transactions charge convenience fees.\"we make our money in volume,\" phillips said, so the fees are usually low. \"for example, the typical transaction charge for vehicle registration would be 25 cents.\"but nic's self-funded model was criticized by other companies, who said that nic has recouped its funds not only through convenience fees but also by selling dmv data.phillips adamantly denied selling personal data. he said that for a fee, nic simply makes available on the internet data that the state already makes available.for example, if a state charges $3 for each dmv record it sells to an insurance company, nic could charge $4 to make the record available on the internet. it would only keep $1.phillips added that some businesses need data for legitimate business purposes, and that nic was simply facilitating those businesses.but jason catlett, of the privacy advocacy firm junkbusters, said that drivers' dmv records should only be made available on an \"opt-in\" basis.\"there's an awful lot of bad stuff done with driver's license information,\" catlett said. because the dmv knows your height and weight, he said, the data can be used for far more insidious purposes than insurance.\"for example, states have sold data to magazines for 'full-figured' women,\" he said.but phillips insisted that nic does not invade citizens' privacy, because the company complies with all state laws. he added that while the transaction fees from the sale of such records have traditionally accounted for a big part of the company's revenues, that number was \"shrinking.\"govworks.com, another big e-government company, has tried a different tack in its approach to modernizing government.govworks was founded in 1998 after kaleil isaza tuzman, its founder, forgot to pay an $80 parking ticket. soon, tuzman owed more than $500 in fines related to the unpaid ticket, and he had an idea for a new company.the company's original plan was to drag the government kicking and screaming down the information superhighway. its website allowed you to pay your fines online, wherever you lived, whether or not your municipality was internet-ready.if the government didn't allow online payments, govworks would actually write a check and mail it in for you -- at a small convenience fee, of course.but the company soon realized that governments didn't look too kindly upon this forced digitization. and since govworks decided that it also wanted to get into the business of providing e-government applications to municipalities (like the other e-gov firms), it realized that it was angering its biggest customers. not a good idea.now, govworks downplays the role of its website, saying that it is mostly in the business of selling e-government solutions to localities.its website, representatives of the firm said, serves mostly to aggregate public information about governments: you want to find out the state bird of wisconsin, or who's your representative in congress? go to govworks.com. or yahoo.with all these firms trying to get a piece of the e-government pie, it's clear that many government transactions will be online sooner rather than later.both al gore and george bush have promised multimillion-dollar governmental reform initiatives to modernize the federal government."}
