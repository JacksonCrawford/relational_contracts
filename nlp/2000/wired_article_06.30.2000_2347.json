the internet promised to \"change our lives\" -- and it has. now, biotech holds the same promise, but in a much more literal sense.doctors, health care administrators, and biotech business gurus gathered at the fourth annual next 20 years meeting in san francisco on wednesday evening to discuss post-human genome medicine. the consensus: the technologies changing medicine will drastically improve our physical lives, but at the same time challenge our philosophical sense of self.tom abate, a biotech reporter for the san francisco chronicle who moderated the event, said the \"gene era\" zeitgeist suggests that biology will allow us to regard ourselves as machines. while this could translate into a sensible and economical way to practice medicine, abate said viewing our make-up as so much apparatus is also worrisome.\"i wonder if we aren't about to lose our soul (or) our spirit in this mechanistic fashion. i wonder if we have the wisdom to apply our knowledge -- if we won't become victims of our own pride,\" he said.the speakers who followed -- two of them biotech entrepreneurs -- echoed abate's concerns, repeating the notion that biotech has soul.the flood of knowledge that will follow the human genome map will answer many questions, but experts pointed out that some questions just can't be answered, even by unraveling each of the 3.2 billion chemical letters that make us human.\"why are we here? who are we? how did the genetic code come about? what is the human spirit? how does poetry come about?\" asked randy scott, president and chief scientific officer of incyte genomics. \"love, all of the things that we hold near and dear -- technology will not answer those questions. i hope that humanity will.\"humanity may never answer those questions. nonetheless, scott said answers in medicine will come fast. both moore's law and metcalfe's law will accelerate the speed of progress in the biotech industry, replicating the growth of the computer and internet industries.\"the effect of moore's law is pretty straightforward,\" scott said. moore's law, conceived by gordon moore, the founder of intel, maintains that computer power doubles every 18 months. in biology, dna sequencing rates are doubling every year.\"while you may recognize that the human genome project has been going on for the past ten years, you may not realize that all of the sequencing for the human genome has happened in the last year, and over 50 percent of that just within the last four months,\" said scott.metcalfe's law, scott said, will help researchers waste less and make discoveries faster. conceived by robert metcalfe who invented the ethernet, the law states that the power of a network increases exponentially with the number of computers connected to it.right now up to 80 percent of research is wasted, because graduate students and postdocs repeat past experiments as part of their training, and scientists refuse to share their research until it's published, which can be up to two years after the results are compiled.\"metcalfe's law is going to do to biology what the internet has done to e-commerce,\" he said. \"it's going to connect vast groups of people who previously didn't talk.\"instead of putzing around in the lab for weeks or months, scientists will search web-based databases to quickly narrow their ideas and devise experiments that they know they are unique and relevant.dr. paul billings, a genetic expert, co-founder of genesage and chief medical officer at the heart of texas veterans health care system, made his own predictions.reproductive cloning and germ line stem cell therapies, the type that can influence future generations, will never see the light of day, he said. neither will designer children.\"but if your hope is to have less inherited and genetic diseases in your children, i think that's a realizable goal,\" billings said.he also predicted that every child will be \"genotyped,\" or screened for predispostion to disease and reaction to drugs at birth, and that everyone will have a id card in the form of a cd-rom containing their own genetic make-up.but although 99.9 percent of genetic material is the same in all humans, that knowledge won't convince people that everyone's alike beneath the skin.as an example, bilings told the story of one of his patients who wanted a genetic justification to prohibit the marriage of his daughter to someone of the \"wrong\" religion.\"that's a very old theme, and genetics is often about very old curses,\" he said. \"many of those things will not be fixed by a complete database and new genomic technologies. but i'm very hopeful that health care will benefit in the long run.\"health care could be benefiting already, but the disparity between the achievements of research and what's offered in the form of consumer health care remains vast.abate pointed out that in california, one in four people don't have health insurance.\"they don't even have access to basic and fundamental care, much less this brave new world we're ushering in, and i think that's a real indictment -- that the species that cracked the genetic code has not figured out how to deliver universal health care,\" abate said.scott also spoke of a discontinuity between what's available to consumers and what's been discovered or invented. but he said that consumer demand will bring these advances to the public.\"when the hiv community found out that the hiv virus had been sequenced (and) new drugs were on the way, they began to storm the walls in washington to accelerate the advances in those products,\" scott said. \"that is going to come, i think, in spades.\"mary cain, a director for health care horizons at the institute for the future, predicted that health insurance will be packaged much differently in the gene era.\"those with good genes might opt to buy only a minimum level of coverage,\" cain said. \"those with a predisposition to disease may be more open to behavior modifications to reduce their risk for developing a disease in return, perhaps, for a discounted premium.\"the next 20 years event couldn't have come at a better time. with the human genome map -- what billings called \"the biggest pr event ever staged\" -- completed just days before, interest in the topic was piqued.scott wondered, \"can we capture the power to alleviate human suffering and at the same time, not put the human population at risk?\"but he said he knows one thing for sure: \"the ensuing ten years will be the most exciting in all human history.\""}
