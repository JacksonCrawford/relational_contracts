"the celebrated inventor of the windup radio is helping to test boots that convert the energy of walking into electricity for powering gadgets such as cellphones and handhelds. trevor baylis, a onetime garage tinkerer who shot to fame and fortune with the invention of a clockwork-powered radio, is part of a 50-strong group trekking 100 miles across an african desert to raise money for charity.but as well as supporting the mines advisory group, a british anti-land mine charity, baylis is participating in the field testing of two different technologies for converting the energy of walking into enough power to run a range of personal electronic devices, from mini stereos to handheld computers.baylis is wearing a pair of experimental boots with soles made from a piezoelectric material, which generates high voltages of electricity when compressed. a companion, john grantham, an engineer with texon international, is wearing boots with a tiny dynamo built into the heel.depending on the outcome of the desert trials, baylis plans to commercialize one or both technologies. baylis has co-launched a startup, the electric shoe company, to bring power-generating footwear to market, possibly within a year.in a now famous rags to riches story, baylis invented a clockwork radio in his home workshop near london in 1993. he struggled to find a manufacturer until his invention was eventually featured on a british tv science program. it was immediately picked up by a pair of south african entrepreneurs, who founded baygen power industries to mass produce the radios.the freeplay radio and related products like a windup lantern are now sold worldwide. baylis has since become a leading proponent of \"personal power\" and was awarded the order of the british empire at buckingham palace in 1997.baylis' latest project, piezoelectric boots, depends on the property of certain crystals to generate electrical charges under mechanical load.for years, piezoelectric materials have been used in the electronic ignition switches on gas stoves. but instead of generating a charge for a spark, baylis' boots convert the electricity into a trickle of current capable of charging a cell phone battery.by thursday, when he walks into range of the nearest cell tower, baylis' boots should have generated enough power to make an international phone call to british entrepreneur richard branson, head of the virgin empire. like baylis, branson is a supporter of mag, which organized the trek across the namibian desert to highlight the plight of neighboring angola which is riddled with land mines. branson has plans to map minefields from the air using a virgin blimp. not uncoincidentally, he is also a new player in the lucrative uk cellphone market.meanwhile, baylis' companion grantham is wearing a pair of boots with a miniature dynamo built into one of the heels. each time the heel hits the ground, the dynamo spins, generating a small trickle of current.baylis dreamed up the dynamo system and contracted with jim gilbert, a lecturer in electrical engineering at the university of hull, to build it.gilbert, an expert in designing components for wearable computers, said the dynamo boot generates slightly more power than the piezoelectric one, but is based on newer technology and may not prove as rugged.\"it's pretty good, it provides enough power,\" gilbert said. \"the question is how long the mechanism will last.\"gilbert used a small, off-the-shelf dynamo, similar to ones that power bicycle lights. \"the clever thing about it is -- it isn't driven directly,\" gilbert said. \"instead of getting a burst of energy when the heel hits the ground, the energy is stored to get more even power and that makes it more efficient.\"gilbert declined to be specific, citing a patent claim. both the piezoelectric and dynamo boots generate between 100-150 milliwatts of power, not enough to run a cellphone but sufficient to trickle-charge the battery.future refinements should enable the boots to generate between 1 and 3 watts of power, which would be sufficient to run a host of gadgets, gilbert said.all this makes baylis see dollar signs.his electric shoe company is funded by texon international, the world's largest manufacturer of footwear components, supplying soles and shoe linings to nike, adidas, reebok and dr. martens. texon engineers developed the piezoelectric boots.\"we want to be the intel of the footwear industry,\" said piers hubbard-miles, managing director of the electric shoe company, which plans to license power-generating technologies to shoe manufacturers.as well as testing the two prototypes in the desert, the company is looking at least two other systems, hubbert-miles said.one design features a tiny hydo-electric motor built into the sole of a shoe. a bag of liquid in the heel squirts a jet across the motor when the wearer's heel presses down. the liquid is collected in another chamber in the front of the shoe, which squirts it back again when the wearer rocks onto the ball of their foot. the system is patented by a canadian inventor, hubbert-miles said.\"in theory it works,\" said hubbert-miles. \"but it looks like it's going to be so complex it will be on a par with making a swiss watch.\"electric boots and shoes will be useful for backpackers, hikers, and people working in the wilderness, hubbert-miles said.the british and u.s. military have also shown interest because the biggest supply problem faced by armies is providing troops in the field with fresh batteries for telecommunications equipment, hubbert-miles said.already, the electric shoe company has contracted to supply boot-power technology to the british department of defense's defense evaluation and research agency -- the u.k. equivalent of darpa.darpa is also developing a similar technology for american gis, a spokeswoman said.the search for pedestrian-power has a long and varied history, stretching back to the 1960s, hubbert-miles said. previous attempts failed to generate enough power or weren't rugged enough for commercial use.but the big reason the technology may get a foot in the door is because of a new generation of microelectronic devices that draw very little juice. or as hubbert-miles put it, \"mp3 players have very low power requirements.\""}
