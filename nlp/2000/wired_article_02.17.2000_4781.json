consult them before banning the popular mp3-trading service napster. schools say they're simply having a bandwidth problem. by chris oakes.", "author": "wired staff", "category": "culture", "type": "article", "timestamp": "02.17.2000 03:00 AM", "text": "student fans of napster, a popular service that allows internet users to exchange personal mp3 music files, are signing a petition meant to stop universities from banning the service without giving students their say. organizing indiana university sophomore chad paulson is seeking signatures from university students nationwide. he hopes the effort will get university administrators who've blocked access to napster to reconsider.\"[school administrators] don't have right to censor material when we're the ones who pay the technology fees and we're the ones who support the university,\" said paulson, who is also the founder of the students against university censorship.paulson sent out a mass email about the petition drive wednesday to gather signatures from students affected around the country. he said the effort had gathered 350 signatures by wednesday morning. students from oregon state, washington state, ohio state, harvard, and virginia tech were on board. most of the existing signatures are from students at paulson's own indiana university, however.paulson said his goal is to obtain 10,000 or more signatures by 15 march. at that point he said he might gain free legal support to explore legal options to fighting napster bans.schools nationwide have blocked access to the service, blaming napster users for soaking up precious network bandwidth at unprecedented levels.bucknell university, for example, says napster is responsible for approximately 40 percent of its network's overall traffic. indiana university cites even higher figures.\"at one point, 61 percent of our internet connection was being consumed by the use of napster, and that is much too much recreational use,\" said mark bruhn, information technology policy officer at indiana university.indiana university responded by suddenly blocking napster last saturday -- with little advance notice, paulson said. still, indiana's student paper ran an editorial wednesday agreeing with the decision to shut down napster for being a drain on the network. but the quick shutdown disregarded many students' opinion, paulson said.\"what i'm trying to do is unify students and get them together,\" paulson said.instead of just cutting students off, he said universities should consider student opinions and explore other responses.he noted that napster is working on giving university administrators viable technological options for cutting down on how much university bandwidth the service uses.elizabeth brooks, napster's vice president of marketing, said the company is sympathetic to the concerns on both sides of the issue.\"i think this is wonderful,\" she said. \"support from students and from the independent label community is the best support that napster could wish for at this juncture.\"she said napster has been working to give network administrators greater control over limiting napster's use of network bandwidth. \"i want to emphasize that at the majority, if not at all, campuses, this is not a censorship issue but a practical bandwidth concern.\"indiana's bruhn said that while the school may be open in the future to alternative solutions it has no plans to remove the filter for now.paulson's favored administrative response to napster was displayed by the university of southern california.usc administrators, network managers, and students plan a \"town meeting\" on campus to figure out how to deal with napster overload, while keeping students' rights in mind. they will decide on what action to take after the meeting.usc student senate president tyler kelly said student senate members and others would meet thursday to formulate a student body stance on the issue in advance of the still-unscheduled meeting.\"i really support that, and wish them luck,\" paulson said. indiana university's greg hanek, course coordinator for the computer science department, said his personal opinion is that paulson and the petitioners have a valid point.\"i don't deny the burden napster.com-related traffic is placing on the iu network,\" said hanek. \"they've been tracking this for some time now. however, in light of how usc has decided to handle a similar situation, i wonder if a different approach might have been used here.\"typically it's the bandwidth bottleneck that motivates administrators to shut down napster access. but schools simultaneously face pressure on copyright issues over the music being exchanged, often as mp3 copies of music from copyrighted cds.the recording industry association of america has sued napster, accusing the company of allowing users to make unauthorized copies of music belonging to riaa artists.despite many schools' claims to the contrary, paulson said he fears that qualms over the copyright issue are the real reason some schools are clamping down napster.the riaa regularly sends cease-and-desist letters to school administrators, including usc, when it finds that illegal copies of copyrighted music are originating from servers on the school's network.mp3, meanwhile, is the livelihood of independent music labels, paulson said -- and some of them, like up records, have joined in supporting the spirit of his petition effort. webmasters at indie labels such as sub pop and k records have personally signed the petition.indie labels, they pretty much want to get the word out,\" paulson said. \"they understand that mp3s are useful tools of promotion and not strictly used for piracy.\"at its base, mp3 files are not the issue, indiana administrator bruhn emphasized. \"this is a capacity issue, there is nothing related to content here.\""}
