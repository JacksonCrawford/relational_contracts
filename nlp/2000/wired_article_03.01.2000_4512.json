(which has less than 3 percent of news corp.'s revenues and twice the market cap) and masayoshi son of softbank, which owns 30 percent of yahoo! and chunks of more than 100 other us-based internet companies. to capture their spark he's turned to younger people, putting mark booth, the former chief of british sky broadcasting, in charge of epartners, his new media investment arm, and making his son, james, who headed news corp.'s us internet operations for the past two years, an executive vice president responsible for new media worldwide. does he ever wish he was 27 again like his son and back to two newspapers? \"with all this happening?\" he asks, face brightening. \"yeah, i might understand it better or react faster to it.\" almost immediately, though, he reconsiders. \"no, all the experiences in publishing and public taste and reacting to it - it's been a long lifetime of professional experience, which is, i think, relevant to what's going on. we're still talking about mass tastes.\"although murdoch junior denies any responsibility for focusing his father on the internet - \"it wasn't me! it wasn't me!\" he cries in mock horror - insiders say he's been very influential. whether he can harness the net as effectively as a jerry yang is another question. suit and tie aside, he has the right accoutrements: clark kent eyeglasses, silicon alley headquarters outfitted with a '50s fiberglass rocker and frank gehry cardboard chairs, a staff of twentysomethings in t-shirts and jeans. but at times the younger murdoch has seemed almost as leery of the web as his father: in 1998, for example, he sat out the portal spree that saw disney buy up infoseek and nbc mate with snap!\"we very purposefully stayed out of the fray,\" james maintains. \"there's not going to be an infinite number of players in that category.\" jon richmond, the new president of news digital media, concurs. \"it doesn't make much sense to aggregate a lot of eyeballs and pass them on immediately to somebody else. our idea is to aggregate a lot of eyeballs and keep 'em,\" he says. \"that being said, i wish i'd founded yahoo!\"but while yang and his partners were starting their search engine, news corp. was foundering with delphi. murdoch's strategy ever since has been to wait for high-bandwidth cable-modem connections to open the internet to assets like tv guide and fox's vast library of movies and tv shows. as a print medium, tv guide has been losing ground, but an electronic version in broadband could morph into something murdoch describes as \"the mother of all portals.\" web sites like fox news and fox sports could offer immense troves of videos that would otherwise sit on the shelf.this strategy has its fans: \"given their brand names and given their content, i think they have amazing advantages over the early movers,\" says jessica reif cohen, broadcasting analyst at merrill lynch. \"and they didn't have to spend the money to see how the market would develop.\" but murdoch's new focus on dot-coms is an admission that the future won't wait: in order to be a player in broadband later, news corp. needs to bulk up its web presence now. and the aol-time warner news is a reminder that murdoch has to rely on others for distribution in the emerging world of broadband, just as he does in television.news corp. has made deals with time warner's road runner cable-modem service and with excite@home to carry fox news and fox sports in broadband. but time warner and news corp. have clashed in the past - most memorably in 1996, when time warner set off a feud by declining to carry murdoch's new fox news channel on its new york city cable systems. it was settled, but not before time warner's ted turner said he was looking forward to \"squishing rupert like a bug,\" news corp. filed a $2 billion antitrust suit, turner compared murdoch to \"the late f\u00fchrer,\" and murdoch's new york post ran the page-one headline \"is ted turner nuts?\"murdoch's bid to extend his satellite armada to america came to a bad end three years ago. \"we were too late in this country,\" rupert admits. \"we were so consumed with sky.\" but elsewhere in the world - like asia, with its huge potential for growth and its limited number of cable systems - satellites give him a fat pipe in the sky, and all the leverage that goes with it. with their enormous capacity, digital satellites can deliver interactive television, internet services, movies on demand, anything broadband can offer. and murdoch doesn't lack content, or the ability to get more.take the healtheon/webmd deal, which allows news corp. to get around sky-high internet valuations by trading ad space in its newspapers and broadcasting operations for a stake in the company. news corp. will run webmd columns in its newspapers, \"health minutes\" on its tv news shows, sports-medicine reports on its sports channels, nutrition and fitness shows on its family channels - an arrangement that beefs up its health coverage while building webmd as a brand. similar efforts are under way in other content areas murdoch considers key, like business, travel, and education. \"there are more than 60 million people today in higher education,\" he says. \"there's going to be demand within 20 years for that to go to 180 or 200 million as three-quarters of the world lifts itself out of poverty. there's no way governments or private institutions can supply that in the traditional manner - it's going to have to go electronic. and we're looking at it very closely.\"in the meantime, news corp. is struggling to adapt its existing properties to the web. in the uk, where the downmarket sun features topless models on page three, the company recently launched page3.com, \"home of the great british babe.\" as murdoch tells it, the site was started \"almost as a joke,\" but the snickering stopped as soon as the response came in: \"we had something like 12 million hits in three or four weeks. people sign up for it and want the chance to vote on the prettiest girl of the month. we're getting their names and so on and we'll get back to them.\" in australia, where news corp. publishes dozens of papers, the company is spinning out its highly lucrative classifieds in the form of job-recruitment and auction sites on the web. \"recruitment advertising online is so powerful it's a real opportunity to move into career-management services, a whole end-to-end human-capital business,\" says james murdoch. \"the problem is that when you put it online, it doesn't necessarily stay attached to the newspaper. it's very interesting.\"while he grapples with this stuff, epartners' mark booth serves as news corp.'s antenna to the future. a longtime company operative, booth was still running sky last spring when microsoft offered him a reported $25 million to head its global net operations. rupert murdoch countered by giving booth $300 million in venture capital and promising him a piece of the upside. as part of the deal, murdoch and softbank's masayoshi son - who once worked shoulder-to-shoulder with booth on the launch of a news corp./softbank satellite venture in japan - created a joint fund called eventures. softbank has long been exporting the us-based web firms in its portfolio to japan; eventures was set up to incubate them in the uk, australia, new zealand, and india - in effect, to dot-com half the world.theoretically, booth's job is not to further news corp.'s strategic interests but simply to make investments that pay. but it's no accident that his deals have partnered the company with some of the hottest players on the net, from softbank to equinix, an infrastructure outfit backed by cisco systems and microsoft, to w.r. hambrecht, the web-savvy san francisco investment bank. \"what will a media company look like in 10 years?\" asks booth. \"no one knows. but if we're successful, epartners will create both an institutional understanding of what's going on and also some really interesting new relationships.\"\"i think this is the most complicated, the most fundamental thing we've faced,\" rupert murdoch admits. \"we've had lots of problems, but not like this. there is some fundamental change going on, and it raises difficult questions. how do we adapt to new media? we're searching, we're experimenting, and we have some fairly strong ideas - but no certainties.\""}
