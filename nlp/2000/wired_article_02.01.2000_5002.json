if i spent a day at the basketball court shooting free throws and compiling a good scan of my neural activity, could i fire up those same neural patterns later and keep \"practicing\" my shot - even optimizing it - while i slept?\"sure, your dream-sleep learning example is probably not a bad idea,\" potter tells me. \"i'd love to do something more useful during that third of my life.\"in the meantime, his virtual-rat project faces a number of technical challenges, such as how exactly he's going to pull patterns out of data streaming in from his dish of neurons at 2.3 mbytes per second, per channel - enough to max out a multigig hard disk in one afternoon. if you were using the same technology to record input from every neuron in a human brain, you'd get 150 million gbytes of data per minute - enough to fill a 194-mile-high stack of cd-roms in 60 seconds.potter thinks moore's law and advances in data storage will solve that problem - so long as he has only 60 channels recording from a few hundred neurons. but he must still figure out how to analyze volumes of real-time data and fine-tune his inputs so he can quickly feed coherent information back through the mea to his virtual rat.after that, he hopes to someday connect with an artificial intelligence stupendously smarter than we are, which will show us how to move beyond our limits. \"i decided in the course of my research - and as the result of a lot of undergraduate soul-searching in the reagan era, when i had frequent nightmares of a dr. strangelove scenario - that what humans need is to be a lot smarter,\" he says. \"just look at how many amazing things are done by a computer that weighs only a couple pounds, consumes only about 100 watts, and lasts 100 years.\"some people - me, for instance - might wonder how good an idea it is to devote a life's work to making our brains obsolete. but i take comfort in the thought that by the time potter's way-smart computer arrives, people of my generation will be fitted with cranial implants that can hear our children's eyes roll as we pine for the days when homo sapiens was still the most intelligent thing on the planet.\"i am sure that we are missing some very fundamental things about how brains do what they do ... but jacking in is already a reality with my palm iii,\" says potter, whipping his pda out from a hip holster he designed himself. \"this makes me quite a bit smarter.\""}
