ways for overweight people to burn off excess fat.research, conducted at university of lausanne, uses gps satellites to track the energy output and activity patterns of overweight men and women.the thinking is that by tracking the patient's position -- by measuring movements -- doctors and nutritionists will be able to determine the amount of energy expended.\"the gps logger can measure the position, speed and displacement of the patient,\" said yves schutz, professor of physiology and nutrition at lausanne.while it may seem obvious that overweight people would benefit from exercising, schutz believes the devices will be able to show patients, in a very concrete way, how much more energy they could expend by choosing the stairway over the elevator.\"it is important to say to the patient, 'be more active,' and the patient may walk a little more, or not take the elevator, but he has no way of knowing how many calories he's burned,\" said schutz. \"if you are able to record this data, you will be able to see if the duration of the exercise is beneficial -- you can calculate and tell the patient if his exercise was worthwhile.\"schutz said this information can be very encouraging to the patient, a source of motivation to continue exercising.the device, called a gps logger, is about the size of a cell phone and can be clipped to the patient's belt. it comes with a small antenna that can be attached to a hat or the back of the patient's jacket. when the patient is wearing this equipment his every move can be tracked.unlike most applications of gps technology -- which range from keeping tabs on armies to telling the auto club where you're stranded -- schutz insists that the physical location of the patient is of no interest here.\"we don't care whether the patient is downtown, by a garage or in a restaurant,\" schutz said. \"we do not use the gps logger to be intrusive, but just to track their energy output.\"what they don't track, however, is trips to the neighborhood mcdonald's. while schutz's research does include an evaluation of nutritional intake, the tracking devices are not used to keep tabs on the patients eating habits.when the patient is inside a building or vehicle, the gps signal is blocked. this is where the accelerometer kicks in. this device monitors the patient's activities by using small, 1-centimeter sensors integrated into a belt.the sensors record frontal acceleration, or forward movement, and vertical acceleration, such as jumping. the patient's every move can be recorded, whether he is walking on a flat surface, up a flight of stairs, cycling or jogging.the combination of the two devices \"allow us to measure physical activity both outside, in free living conditions, and inside at home and at work,\" schutz said.the patient wears the devices from the time he gets out of bed to the time he gets back into it, he can discard it when he dons his pajamas. \"when static, the patient does not need to wear the device,\" schutz said.both devices record the information generated by the patient's movement on a second-by-second basis. retrieving the information from the accelerometer is very easy and takes only a couple of minutes.retrieving it from the gps logger is a different matter.\"we have free access to the satellites but downloading the information is more complicated,\" schutz said. \"analysis of the data requires taking into account more variables.\" the number of satellites being used to track the patient can vary -- the more used, the greater the accuracy of the data. schutz has to bear this in mind when analyzing the data.the patients will wear the devices for a period of five to seven days. weekend patterns are different from weekday ones, so the patient needs to wear the device on both periods. \"you can pick up the patients physical activity pattern in a few days,\" schutz said.schutz hopes his research will lead to cheaper and smaller tracking technology that will allow for more research to be carried out.\"it is an interesting combination of technology,\" said jean marc schwarz, assistant professor of nutrition at uc berkeley.\"monitoring energy expenditure in a free-living situation is often carried out by measuring the consumption of oxygen and carbon dioxide expenditure using a metabolic chamber which does not allow for free living conditions,\" schwarz said. \"this technique allows for a daily monitor.\"schwarz did voice some concerns about how the devices could measure all the variables involved in day-to-day activities, which could lead to a \"margin of error.\" however he preferred to reserve judgment until seeing more results from the research.the research, now in its pilot stage, will involve at least 100 subjects who have a body mass index of 40 or more: people who are more than double the normal weight for their height."}
