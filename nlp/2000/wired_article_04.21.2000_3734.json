'now that i've got your attention,' he continued, 'let me tell you how you can all get rich and possibly get a free car to boot.'\"the concepts behind so many startup companies are ridiculous, fishman said, and he wanted to think of something beyond absurd, writing about it as if it were real. esquire never stated that the article was a spoof.\"i really wanted something that seemed an incredibly grandiose idea and people would have an easy idea dismissing,\" fishman said. \"i was wrong.\"his piece fooled a lot of customers, who called up the magazine demanding their \"stayfresh\" minivan.\"the phones were off the hook,\" said esquire spokeswoman jennifer eason.the article was so convincing that david guard, co-founder of the startup mobile billboard network, apparently got scared too.\"he called in a serious panic,\" eason said. \"he called an emergency meeting of his investors. they actually thought they were going to have to regroup and come up with a new business.\"guard was a good sport about the hoax, and sent esquire a letter congratulating them on the article.\"the article was a great spoof and a wonderful inspiration to us because it supports and validates all of our efforts in the last two years,\" he wrote.mobile billboard, which hasn't officially launched yet, will work a bit differently than freewheelz' bogus concept. instead of a free car, a customer will actually have to shell out $199 to \"join\" the network. but if the customer recruits some of his friends to join, he'll get the money back, and will start earning more as he recruits more.think amway for autos.fishman, who said he was stunned by the response he's received from the article, said he's been contacted by several other internet startups him with names like myfreecar.com, freecar.com, and autowraps.com.they were all pretty shaken by the news of their new competition, fishman said, especially the ceo of freecar.com.\"he said he cried when he read the article,\" fishman said.\"the question i ask myself is, who would go into business with these people, if these are the guys who would think my article was real?\""}
