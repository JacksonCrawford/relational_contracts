(nasdaq's spring correction more than halved that figure.) anyone with a modicum of public-relations experience could see the peril in a 60 minutes appearance, but dachis and kanarick couldn't resist. what question could an old media codger possibly ask that they couldn't effortlessly manhandle for the folks at home?the segment began innocuously enough - \"they call themselves 'the dotcom kids.' they're cool, they're hip ... and their motto is don't invest in anyone over thirty\" - and immediately cut to razorfish's downtown offices. there, silver-haired cbs correspondent bob simon, perfectly coiffed and wearing a suit of al gore earth tones, stood with dachis and kanarick. dachis had a kind of mod reservoir dogs thing going - black suit, black tie, white shirt - while kanarick looked more like an off-duty underwear model in his purple suit and yellow shirt, its collar pulled out and stretched across the suit's lapels, travolta-like. he had a short nest of hair precisely moussed by some hundred-fingered stylist to approximate bed head. their attire seemed perfectly chosen to make those who didn't \"get it\" feel more anxious about not getting it. dachis was introduced to the country as razorfish's ceo, kanarick as the company's chief scientist.simon praised razorfish as \"one of the most successful companies on the web,\" but then his tone abruptly changed.\"successful at what?\" he asked. \"good question.\"the camera was now on dachis.\"we've asked our clients to recontextualize their business,\" dachis managed. \"we've re- ... recontextualized what it is to be a business-services ... and that'll continually ... \"simon's face went blank. it wasn't the look of helpless confusion millions of americans were experiencing as dachis stuttered at them through their tv sets. rather, it was the sedate, self-satisfied gaze of a 60 minutes reporter about to yank the lever of the show's legendary trapdoor.\"you know,\" simon said, \"there are people out there, such as myself, who have trouble with the word recontextualize.\" anyone who had ever watched the show knew where this was going: \"people out there, such as myself\" meant \"the rest of the goddamned united states.\" dachis was on his own now. even the chief scientist stood mute.\"tell me what you do,\" simon insisted, \"in english.\"\"we provide services to companies to help them win,\" dachis offered.\"so do trucking firms!\" simon snapped. dachis seemed taken aback - the trucking remark was really uncalled for.\"what is it you do?\" simon pressed.\"our talent is to do a certain thing, whereas the trucking firm ...\"\"yes, but what is - what is it you do?\"\"we radically transform businesses to invent and reinvent them,\" dachis said. it was his best shot.\"that's still very vague,\" simon said cheerily. he looked as if he might high-five his cameraman. a pause of several aeons ensued - too much for even the scientist. kanarick stepped in to summarize the professional services sector in a way that bob simon, and perhaps the rest of america, might understand: \"business strategy,\" he said.for television, this was really rich. here was the whole generational and cultural chasm between those who \"get it\" and those who don't, perfectly dramatized in prime time. millions of viewers could click off their tv sets, confident they weren't being left behind after all. so much for the phenomenon of dotcom gazillionaires - these so-called geniuses of cyberspace couldn't even tell you what they did for a living!but anyone who did get it saw the whole thing quite differently. they knew that razorfish provides what wall street calls it professional services, a complicated, rapidly converging array of technology, consulting, and design. basically, dachis and kanarick were helping old economy companies gain entry into the new economy by plotting a strategy (the consulting part); integrating their existing legacy systems into a platform that's accessible via the web, wireless, or what-have-you (the technology part); and building clean, functional interfaces as web sites or networks of sites (the design part). but try explaining that while peering down the barrel of a 60 minutes camera.still, if anybody was supposed to be able to handle this kind of thing on the fly, it was these guys. people in the alley who knew them simply as jeff and craig - or \"jeffncraig,\" as you frequently heard it in new york - took for granted that if you put either guy in a roomful of corporate executives, he would \"recontextualize\" every last one of them. yet here they were on national television, stumped. it wasn't important that in the ever-morphing world of it professional services, \"what do you do?\" was one of the toughest questions of all to answer succinctly. all that mattered was that two of the alley's supposedly brightest executives had voluntarily strutted right into a classic 60 minutes moment. according to silicon alley reporter editor jason mccabe calacanis, a longtime acquaintance of dachis and kanarick, \"it was the first time anyone had ever made them look stupid.\"__suddenly the 60 minutes reporter yanked the lever of the show's legendary trapdoor: \"tell me in english,\" he insisted, \"what is it you do?\" __\"nobody in the world needs a drill!\" craig kanarick has emerged from deep within his oversize orange sweater, from beneath the brim of his baseball cap, and from the most ennui-riddled rock-star slouch imaginable. he's almost shouting: \"there isn't a person in the world who needs a drill\"it's a sunny summer afternoon in jeff dachis' office at razorfish hq in manhattan's noho district. the decor seems carefully plotted to exude \"edginess.\" there are sleek, stainless steel tables and desks. in one corner is a 6-foot-long felt-covered coffin - a huge, portable turntable setup. (in his spare time, dachis is a dj.) the walls are honeysuckle-yellow and hung with, among other things, a large, rapidly rotating neon clock, several photographs of nudes, and, over the door, a painting of a penis penetrating a vagina. apparently, what galleons in a gale were to the walls of a gulf + western exec's office, phalluses and crotch close-ups are to the business lairs of certain new media titans.kanarick is leaning forward now, giving a sermon that might be called the parable of the drill. it's about as straight an answer to the question \"what does razorfish do?\" as you're likely to get.\"there's not a single human being who needs a drill,\" kanarick says again. \"they need a hole. so you're not in the drill business, you're in the hole business. and, actually, nobody needs a hole - they need to hang art. and nobody needs to hang art, they need a better-looking room. and nobody needs a better-looking room, they need to behappier. so black & decker is in the happy business! and so is every other company!\"that's what we do,\" kanarick says. \"you're not in the dog food business, you're in the pet-ownership-experience business you're not in the cigarette business, you're in the vice-delivery-system business\"dachis is nodding madly.brother craig is still preaching: \"what i'm interested in doing is not building another channel, an amazon channel or a web-based channel for simon & schuster, but more in coaching simon & schuster - 'you know what? you need to scrap all that other stuff, give away palm viis to every student in the country, let them download books from your new information server. now, the $30 they were paying at barnes & noble, simon & schuster makes $3 on. instead, just charge the student $3.50. you're making more profit on your digital download than you did through your old value chain, but your new value chain says that you're giving away something free in exchange for multiple uses of something that doesn't cost you anything to distribute!' that's a radical transformation, or a recontextualization of the book business!\"amen!\"basically, we start with, 'there are digital technologies,' and you end with, 'the world is a really fucking different place.' you have two ways of adapting. one is that you can use digital technology to become more efficient, faster, cheaper, better. the other is that you can adapt to the new laws and transform your business into something completely different. our whole premise was that the transforming companies - the ones that really change - are the ones that are gonna be the most successful. and all we do is help people do that.\"to his competitors, and to executives of companies that are up to speed digitally, kanarick's rap is a mundane, if accurate, description of the pressures the information economy has placed on old economy businesses: adapt or die. but it plays to the worst fears of desperate executives whose companies haven't yet made the leap. the fact that the parable of the drill is a 40-year-old bit of marketing speak recycled - recontextualized, if you will - from a book by famed harvard business school professor ted levitt barely lessens the impact of having one's business model ripped apart by a \"scientist\" with blue hair and dicks on his wall. this is the razorfish shtick, what distinguishes the company from its generically named competitors like scient, viant, sapient, proxicom, ixl, ibm global services, digitas, and agency.com: a very downtown-manhattan, take-a-number attitude that exploits anxious executives in the throes of analogitis.like almost every other it professional services company, razorfish wants to be the first complete one-stop shop for digital services, supplying clients with everything from print-advertising strategies to a strikingly designed pda that lets its users conduct business via wireless connections. the idea is to use digital technology to give users the greatest versatility - what kanarick calls \"user experience as a comprehensive, cross-platform, cross-device, cross-network gestalt.\"razorfish has done some work for new media companies - it helped build theglobe.com's site, assisted quokka with its logo and advertising strategies, and helped charles schwab redesign its 1,000-page site into a unified \"schwab experience.\" but if there's a secret in the it professional services arena, it's that most of the work involves tooling away on web sites for established corporations rather than completely upending the basic rules of economics. the bulk of razorfish's business comes from old economy behemoths like british aerospace, christie's, and pricewaterhousecoopers. razorfish helped shell oil construct an internal communications network to fill its employees in on company news, and was hired by northrop grumman to replace its disparate mainframe applications with a single open, web-based platform as part of the aeronautics company's effort to cut the costs of its fuselage construction business. and while most of its competitors labor officiously on the same kind of projects, razorfish manages to do the work with what kanarick's friend, author douglas rushkoff, calls the \"razorfish smirk.\"\"the smirk means, 'we're going to immerse ourselves in the world of business, but we're going to treat it like play,'\" rushkoff says. \"it's like looking at the guy who gets women all the time and then treats them shitty. it's annoying.\"__their downtown, take-a-number attitude exploits fear of analogitis. so does the smirk. but the work is a far cry from upending basic rules of economics. __dachis and kanarick were childhood pals, and the story of their chance meeting years later is emblematic of the serendipity that has characterized razorfish. they grew up in minneapolis, both members of the city's small jewish community. they went to hebrew school together as kids, and their parents were friendly. kanarick was a math geek - he took advanced college-level calculus at the university of minnesota in 10th and 11th grades - while jeff, the youngest of seven, ran with a crowd of actors and dancers. in high school, jeff says, kanarick was merely \"a guy i'd always say hi to.\" the two lost contact when they went away to college, kanarick to the university of pennsylvania to study philosophy and computer science and dachis to the state university of new york at purchase to study dance.after penn, kanarick went for his master's at the mit media lab. dachis, by contrast, was lost. though he thought of himself as someone who was \"always hustling\" - scalping football tickets or quickly turning around a used car at a profit - dachis aspired to be an actor. he spent a summer working as a gypsy dancer in the new england renaissance festival, then moved to a loft in jersey city, new jersey, and waited tables and delivered singing telegrams across the river in manhattan. from his apartment, he started a guerrilla marketing company, in your face, that hired crews to do things like hand out samples of a new spicy wings product for kentucky fried chicken. dachis tried to meld his interest in the arts and business by pursuing a master's degree in performing arts administration at nyu, but the experience soured him on the arts altogether. the performing arts world, he says, was focused \"on building these grant-writing machines instead of figuring out ways to sell tickets. it disgusted me.\"graduate school left dachis more than $100,000 in debt and feeling \"extremely beaten.\" he decided to move back to minneapolis to work for his oldest brother, who was building a company called game financial to facilitate credit card transactions for the gambling industry.\"i was giving up my 'new york-acting, jeff-pursuing-his-muse' lifestyle.\" to this day, dachis says, he doesn't dance, not even at parties.working for his brother, dachis picked up the rudiments of business by helping to draft sec filings and preparing the company for its ipo. game financial went public in 1993, but despite the success, dachis felt \"not able to be me\" while working for his older brother. he abandoned his stock options and headed back to new york, this time with hopes of becoming a businessman. his decision to leave, he says, was \"the most liberating moment, even though i had nothing and i was completely in debt.\"things were going more smoothly for kanarick. he finished at mit and moved to manhattan's chelsea district, where he hung out, \"working a look,\" he says, \"with long hair and glasses the size of windshields.\" he freelanced as a designer for blender, a hip cd-rom magazine, began teaching at nyu's interactive telecommunications program, and fell in with manhattan's first wave of digital designers.dachis, meanwhile, had become obsessed with the idea of using the internet to market music. he got a job at a label called tvt records, where he was so insistent about going digital that his boss couldn't take it. after just two weeks, dachis was fired and escorted from the building.\"he was single-minded in saying that what i was working on was not what i should be working on,\" says his former boss, tvt president steve gottlieb. \"entrepreneurs don't always make the best employees.\"after being eighty-sixed, dachis plodded across the street to a pay phone. he was as broke as ever and feeling like hell, so he called the only person he knew in new york who might be able to hook him up with a job - freddy terranova, a pal from jersey city who had just taken a position managing a graphics production company.terranova got dachis work fiddling with quark on the overnight shift. through an old tvt colleague who was doing some work for blender, dachis heard about a cool young programmer named kanarick. he turned out to be dachis' childhood pal. the two got together and kanarick offered to show dachis what he'd been working on. they went to kanarick's apartment, and, using mosaic, they accessed mit's server and kanarick's personal web page, the craig-o-matic, which prominently featured a collage of kanarick's head atop a nude woman's body.\"totally cool,\" dachis told him.almost immediately, dachis began to pitch kanarick an idea for a business. they met in dachis' east village apartment, where he drew a three-pronged diagram on a napkin showing the words technology, media, and services. the general business plan, he explained, was to \"get paid for what you do by the hour, get paid for what you do with a recurring license fee, and get paid for what you do while you sleep.\"the particulars of how that might happen were still undetermined, but dachis was settled on the division of labor. he cast himself as the numbers guy - dachis is a self-described \"brutal capitalist\" who idolizes henry kravis, the '80s takeover baron and former primedia chair. dachis envisioned kanarick as the programmer and creative mind.kanarick wasn't interested in being the next henry kravis, but he did see a certain value in aligning himself with \"somebody who wants to make you money,\" as he puts it.__dachis' cocktail napkin business plan: \"get paid for what you do by the hour, get paid with a recurring license fee, and get paid while you sleep.\" __\"here's a guy who has all these skills that i not only don't have, but that, frankly, i'm not interested in having,\" kanarick says. \"i never want to fire anybody, i never want to negotiate a salary. he's like, 'those are the things i like to do.'\"ultimately, it was their childhood connection in minnesota that sealed the partnership. \"from day one, it was complete, 100 percent trust and respect,\" kanarick says. \"we'd joke around: 'you're embezzling money, i'll tell your mom!' we never had to check the books, we never had to ask the other person what he was up to.\"whatever their bond, friends didn't understand it. kanarick says they were surprised that two people with such disparate interests would join forces - and they were downright dismayed that he and dachis planned to split their new company evenly. \"a lot of people said to me, 'well, you're doing all the work, right? you're doing all the design, you're doing all the creativity. isn't that really the job, and he's just managing you?' and other people said to him, 'well, wait a minute. you're running the business. he's just a designer, right?'\"kanarick wasn't convinced he'd done the right thing, he says, until almost a year later, when razorfish moved into its first office. dachis asked a young assistant to go downstairs to a pay phone and arrange phone service with a local carrier.\"she came upstairs and said, 'ok, they'll be here in three weeks, and for the seven lines there'll be a $750 installation fee.' jeff was like, 'are you fucking kidding?' he goes downstairs, comes back, and says, 'they'll be here tomorrow, and installation is free.' and i was like, 'that's why he gets half the business.'\"when dachis and kanarick began razorfish - they chose the name randomly from the dictionary - no one knew yet that the real money would be in charging large companies to help them put content on the web, not in producing the content itself. in 1995, kanarick designed a web page he called the blue dot, that featured - what else? - a bouncing blue dot. at the time, there was little in the way of color or animation on the web. the page was one of the first pieces in place in the razorfish studios, a series of artsy, sometimes unbearably effete sites that featured forward-thinking digital design, rants, and, for a while, even a \"virginity reclamation\" service. razorfish studios published celebrity-rocker photographs by danny clinch and nude photos by spencer tunick. most of all, it helped establish the parent company as an edgy, downtown kind of operation.the blue dot became a hit with the local web community - the heavy traffic crashed the server - but the site didn't produce any revenue. the experience prompted dachis and kanarick to refine their business plan.\"you can't decide,\" says dachis, \"whether you're gonna develop technology to make blue dots bounce, whether you're gonna create the most interesting blue dots so that people visit for the content, or whether you're gonna sell the services that you have by the hour to make blue dots for other people. and that was the three-pronged approach that ended up on the back of a napkin in 1995. so we circled the services business as the immediate revenue-generator.\"through a friend of a friend, razorfish landed its first job, a $20,000 contract to build a site for time warner's pathfinder. that led to one with prodigy, then to one for at&t. soon razorfish was getting more business than it could handle. dachis and kanarick hired friends to help, and they informed the world via press release about every new employee or client. razorfish's frequent faxes became a running joke in the alley and inspired an east village web designer named jaime levy to distribute a phony release announcing that jeff dachis had tripped on his own shoelace.by 1996 the company had grown to 25 employees and had $32 million in revenues. from the beginning, kanarick and dachis tried hard to create a distinct razorfish culture, the central tenet of which was that \"work is social life,\" according to kanarick. \"a lot of consulting businesses are founded on this sort of 'bring in a bunch of people. one out of every ten of you will make partner; the other nine won't be here in a year.' we took the exact opposite philosophy: 'you don't join the company, you join the family.'\"razorfish's detractors say the place can sometimes feel cultlike, with dachis and kanarick as parental figures. (one points out that the company intranet is called \"mom.\") and a former executive grumbles that some employees were willing to work for less money in exchange for the \"glamour wage\" of being associated with dachis and kanarick.these days, razorfish uses typical new economy rah-rah techniques to keep workers happy: pizzas, aeron chairs, lectures, and massages. in 1999, dachis and kanarick spent around $2 million to fly the entire staff to las vegas for the weekend. but what entices some people to join the family compels others to leave it. oz lubling, the company's first hire and now mom's chief caretaker, says that people most often quit because \"not everybody wants to hang out in a work environment where there are no boundaries.\"razorfish was able to fund its early growth without taking on investors; the work actually paid the bills. then, in late 1996, it attracted the attention of john wren, ceo of the investment group omnicom. wren was known for a round of lucrative investments he'd made in the 1980s in marketing-services companies. in 1995 he began work on his hunch that the next wave of growth in the professional services arena would be in digital design. through omnicom's investment arm, communicade, wren started placing an incredibly prescient series of bets on small, rapidly growing shops like agency.com, organic, and think new ideas. omnicom's strategy was to hold its investments for years, and wren was known to scrutinize a company's management before investing. in his meetings with dachis and kanarick, wren says, \"i was impressed with their candor. you never leave the room not knowing where they come from.\"wren agreed to take a stake of just under 20 percent in razorfish - he and dachis hammered out the basics of the deal on a manhattan street corner, both of them leaning against wren's '85 volvo. omnicom would pay $3.6 million up front, plus another $3.5 million if razorfish met certain growth targets. and omnicom would provide razorfish with a line of credit to fund acquisitions. the deal included an unusual detail - wren bought his shares directly from dachis and kanarick themselves, rather than the company, as is customary. razorfish's detractors speculate that wren knew he could get a better deal if he dangled several million dollars in cash before two wide-eyed twentysomethings - a notion he disputes.\"i decided that they were going to be partners for the long term, and if they felt they needed to be wealthy while they were building the company, i wanted to facilitate that,\"wren says. if the deal were only about making dachis and kanarick rich, wren contends, \"they could've taken the money and gone to the bahamas.\"at any rate, in 1996, long before the wave of silicon valley ipos, dachis and kanarick were among manhattan's first twentysomething internet millionaires.\"we talked about being conscious of your own self-actualization,\" dachis says, \"to be actually in the moment and be like, 'god, look what's happening to us! we're becoming cybercelebrities,' or 'we're creating the future; we're actually part of a revolution!' to be conscious of that when it's occurring, and to then discuss it, like, 'god, are you feeling it?' it's like when you get stoned or something: 'are you stoned yet? you know? are you feeling what i'm feeling? is it coming on?'\"__\"we talked about being in the moment, like, 'god, look what's happening! we're creating the future; we're becoming cybercelebrities. do you feel it?'\" __with the omnicom line of credit to back them up, dachis and kanarick joined an industry-wide race to gobble up smaller shops. other digital integration companies, like usweb (now marchfirst) and ixl, were on mad shopping sprees, rolling up smaller companies in a bid to pool expertise and seize market share. dachis wanted to acquire businesses that could expand razorfish's expertise from simply building sites to being able to handle image management across any digital platform - but the challenge was to find companies that could mesh with the razorfish culture.\"on the acquisition and expansion trail, it was always about analyzing the people,\" dachis says. \"you say, 'are these people i wanna go out to dinner with? are these people i would invite over to my house? that i would go away on vacation with? that i would want to spend all day with?'\"in 1998 razorfish bought london-based chbi, new york-based avalanche, and san francisco-based plastic: all were primarily design shops, but they gave razorfish a new geographical reach. then, in late 1998, dachis pulled off his biggest coup yet, buying the digital consulting arm of swedish portal spray ventures, headed by charismatic cyberceleb jonas svensson. the deal gave razorfish instant credibility in northern europe, and offices in such cities as stockholm, hamburg, and helsinki. but the acquisition was expensive to dachis and kanarick. spray ventures got 40 percent of razorfish's common stock - so by the time dachis and kanarick took their company public in early 1999, their stakes had been pared down to below 10 percent each.still, in just over a year, dachis had turned razorfish into a global company, more than quadrupled its revenues, and increased its workforce to nearly 1,100. even razorfish's rivals allow that the expansion was successful.\"they've done a better job of integrating their acquisitions than a lot of their competitors,\" says jonathan nelson, the ceo of digital integrator organic. \"razorfish isn't perceived as a roll-up. they have an integrity of brand that's really impressive.\"razorfish's international presence and 1998 revenues of $83 million put it on solid ground for its ipo. dachis handled the de rigueur road show: as effective as kanarick's blue hair was at scaring executives into doing business with razorfish, it didn't do much to project gravitas to wall street. (even today, almost all communication with the street is handled by dachis.) razorfish's stock debuted at $8 in april 1999 and moved as high as $55 in early 2000 before settling back into the 20s by summer.dachis and kanarick recently moved the company headquarters a couple of doors down from tvt records: dachis can now look out on the very pay phone where his life began to turn around; he even hired his old pal freddy (now fred) terranova as an operations manager.the company's acquisitions have had a bearing on the persistent question that has followed razorfish and other web integrators since long before bob simon asked, \"what do you do?\" companies in the quickly evolving it professional services sector are increasingly expected to have expertise in all three areas of the business - consulting, design, and technology. so firms that built their names on technology skills, for example, have raced to develop or acquire consulting and design expertise.the rub for razorfish is that wall street has come to view design as a lightweight discipline, and design firms, by extension, as hawking style over the substance of technology and strategic consulting. the company now faces the irony that the very things that distinguished it from its competitors early on - edgy design, flashy executives, and close ties with dachis and kanarick's artsy content play-toy, razorfish studios - risk becoming liabilities in a marketplace that has grown jaded, and even resentful, of mere \"creative\" companies.\"there is a view on the street that phase two of ebusiness consulting will favor the heavy technology implementation services, like writing ebusiness software applications,\" says karl keirstead, an analyst at lehman brothers who covers the sector. \"so the street is aligning with strong technology firms, and the creative firms are getting a valuation multiple discount. in some respects, razorfish's heritage is hurting the stock today.\"dachis calls this sort of talk \"utter bullshit,\" and dismisses wall street analysts as \"clueless lemmings who just re-spout what they read from jupiter and forrester.\" still, he hasn't completely ignored their message. though dachis remains the ceo of razorfish studios, the content company has been rebranded rsub (short for razorfish subnetwork) in an effort to let the street know that the money-losing content site featuring the essay \"dick for a day\" is separate from the company doing design and programming work for northrop grumman and shell oil. razorfish's pr department expends no small amount of energy steering reporters away from inquiries about rsub, but the company keeps getting attention, as it did in april, when the subnetwork bought michael stipe's film production company.last fall, razorfish made a big play to assert itself as a technology company when it purchased boston-based i-cube, known for its programming skills, for $1.2 billion. and in december, razorfish acquired t. s. designs, a company that specializes in evaluating \"user experience.\"analysts are divided over what to make of these more recent acquisitions. lehman's keirstead argues that, by buying i-cube, \"dachis changed the perception of the company in one fell swoop.\" but forrester research's paul sonderegger stated in a late-june report that the i-cube and t. s. designs deals have \"yet to prove their worth.\"__razorfish boasts that it pioneered the integrated approach to it professional services. meanwhile, its hybrid of hip and flash has provoked a backlash. __dachis calls such speculation \"bogus.\" in the tradition of his sometimes-grandiose assertions, he claims not only to have mastered the current it professional services model, but to have invented it. \"we've always been a hybrid services firm since day one,\" he says. \"we pioneered that integrated approach.\"hearing jeff dachis fume over the nuances of the razorfish brand, it's hard to believe that just over five years ago, he was a dancer and kanarick was tooling away on the craig-o-matic. these days, the two consider themselves lucky to be in the same city for their weekly \"one on one.\" the bulk of their communications is via email, and they depend more than ever on the mutual trust from their childhood together.\"as soon as i'm feeling weird about something, i call him up,\" dachis says. \"i'm guilty of not communicating as well as maybe craig would want me to. i don't always send him an email telling him what i'm thinking. typically, i act.\" dachis still considers kanarick his best friend.\"we're able to be brutally honest with each other when we need to be,\" kanarick says. \"we can tell each other to fuck off pretty easily.\"over the past five years, each has discovered his identity more, according to their friend and employee oz lubling. \"they're different, so they've separated a bit,\" he says. \"there's a lot of nostalgia for the early days. we may be sitting a few steps from each other, but we've all grown apart some.\"a recent situation is typical: dachis is hopping between boston and los angeles, while kanarick is in stockholm, checking on the construction of razorfish's office there - it will have a pool and a bar in the basement - and giving a talk to a hall full of cell phone-toting swedes at sime, the annual stockholm conference on emerging digital technologies. kanarick shows up in a wild, grape-purple ozwald boateng suit, english-cut with a natty side-vented jacket. he's wearing purple socks and a black shirt, and he's doing the travolta-collar thing again. kanarick snaps on a garth brooks-style headset microphone, and is introduced to the crowd over a loud pa system as if he were a professional wrestler entering the ring: \"ladies and gentlemen craaaaaiiiiiggg kanarick!\" kanarick enters and starts pacing back and forth, staring at his shoes as he delivers a capsule history of mobility from 13,000 years ago (spears, bags of flint) to today (cell phones, pdas). afterward, he heads to the bar at the lydmar hotel, orders a beer, and descends into a big lounge chair, assuming his ennui-riddled rocker pose again. he starts riffing on the weird experience of being recognizable and, well, opined upon.\"i've always been interested in celebrity,\" he says. \"i remember sitting across from leo\" - that's dicaprio, people - \"looking at him, and saying to myself, 'right now there are 500 women in the world masturbating to the thought of him, and i can't get women i know to take off their clothes for me.' you think you know him. people read these articles, and they don't say that leo dicaprio is a good actor or a bad actor - they say, 'i love him' or 'i hate him.'\"now people think they know me. on one hand, it's a problem. on the other, do i care if some housewife in rosedale reads an article in new yorkmagazine and says i'm a schmuck? does it affect my ability to get a reservation at the restaurants where i like to eat?\"if you were craig kanarick's friend right now, you'd tell him to relax, that being a professional services honcho on the cover of value added reseller isn't the same as being a movie star on the cover of people. but kanarick's friends say that this is the essence of his charm: he says what he thinks. after all, who doesn't have the occasional grandiose thought? and how would you feel if you went from the craig-o-matic to the craigar in five years?\"i could talk nine hours about the downside of going public,\" kanarick says. \"i now have 30 people in investor relations. every three months, you bend over and have some guys shove a flashlight up your ass - and you have to deal with analysts, some of whom don't understand our business. they just want to hear buzzwords. you say 'wireless,' and they say 'strong buy!'\"would i do it all over again? yes. would i do it again if every office of razorfish were simultaneously blown up and nobody was left but me - would i start a new razorfish and take it public? no.\"if there is a point of departure between kanarick and dachis, it's this last issue. it seems improbable that razorfish will be the last company dachis takes public or, at least, the last public company he heads. while kanarick spends his glam time with people like courtney love, dachis is busy pestering henry kravis to take a meeting, which, for him, is the ultimate gas.\"what's baffling and fascinating to me every day is that i can call up business hero number one of mine, business hero number two, business hero number three: they know me, they take my call!\" dachis says. \"that, to me, is the most amazing thing. like, they hear the name - they know razorfish - and they take my call, and then they take my meeting, and then we're friends and start to hang out. they're asking me what my opinion is. nobody was listening a few years ago. now people want to hear what we have to say.\"there's a sense, though, that others are growing weary of all that dachis and kanarick have to say. indeed, the skepticism surrounding the company's recent acquisitions hints at a potential problem in razorfish's future - that its founders' hip shtick could go out of style as quickly as one of kanarick's suits. the company's take-a-number attitude could lose its allure as old economy executives get hip to the digital world. and dachis and kanarick's cocky, sometimes petulant, declarations could provoke a backlash from the press, analysts, and even clients.__the club and the ducati, kravis and courtney, it's all part of razorfish's \"cross-platform, cross-device, cross-network\" brand of user experience. __already there is some evidence of this. a recent forrester research report ranked razorfish \"average\" and practically mocked the company's grandiose self-image. \"razorfish professes to merge qualitative and quantitative data to better understand customer behavior,\" the report states. \"however, when pressed, the firm reveals that it lacks methodologies and experience in this area.\"and in mid-july a web startup called iam.com sued razorfish, claiming the company missed almost all of its delivery deadlines, and that its work was \"flawed by grave technical and navigational problems.\" iam complained that \"virtually every aspect of the site developed by razorfish fails to meet iam.com's needs or basic levels of workmanship in the web development industry.\" (razorfish, which declined to comment on the suit, filed its own legal action against iam.com a few days later. among other things, razorfish accused the company of breach of contract, saying it had previously expressed strong satisfaction with razorfish's work.)perhaps sensing its vulnerability, razorfish's rivals - once awed by dachis and kanarick's ability to get attention - are taking their first public potshots, however oblique, at the duo.\"as often as not, they come across unfavorably as people,\" says kyle shannon, the regular-guy cofounder of agency.com, who has, colleagues say, described himself as \"the anti-kanarick.\"\"what it hasn't done is hurt them as a company,\" he says. \"the liability is, will that catch up with them? there may be a point where people say, 'hey, wait a minute.'\"the most alarming sign came, oddly enough, from razorfish's first investor. in february, omnicom sold a quarter of its stake in the company for $141 million in a private transaction - 80 times its original investment. although john wren's company still holds a large stake in razorfish, the sale stung dachis because it ran counter to omnicom's buy-and-hold strategy, and because wren hasn't sold any of his stakes in razorfish rivals agency.com and organic. dachis says his relations with omnicom are now \"stressed\" and \"not where we want them to be.\"\"as far as we're concerned,\" he says of omnicom, \"they're just another shareholder.\"wren says the omnicom sale was nothing more than a \"strategic decision\" unrelated to whatever liabilities lie in doing business with such outspoken executives.\"i'm sure jeff wishes we'd never sold any of it,\" wren says. \"but we're not bailing out. they've been able to accomplish something lots of companies spend years and years and millions of dollars trying to accomplish - they've established razorfish as a brand. i see their style as benefiting them, not being harmful.\"at least one significant razorfish shareholder reports to having asked dachis and kanarick to tone down their act for the good of the company. dachis says that questions about his public persona are irrelevant in the face of his company's nearly 100 percent revenue growth. he compares himself to business mavericks like barry diller, david geffen, and richard branson and says, \"you can knock me for speaking frankly and not kissing wall street's ass. but the numbers are the numbers.\"it's a sweltering saturday afternoon, and jeff dachis is sitting in the slipper room in a gray t-shirt and baggy army pants, his mustard-colored arai motorcycle helmet under his arm. he's offering his own take on the razorfish myth.\"we've been confident because we think we're right,\" dachis says. \"but a lot of the mythology that surrounds us is not created by us. it's people telling the story of naked women at a razorfish party in '96. fine. but there were no naked women. i don't want to be an internet celebrity - i want to make money.\" dachis is late to meet his parents - he's taking them to paris in the morning aboard the concorde for their first trip to europe - and he exits the bar, disappears into his helmet, and climbs aboard his new ducati. \"some people like me, some people hate me,\" dachis says with a shrug. \"i'm ok with that.\"he cranks and revs his motorcycle. the image of jeff dachis, new media peacock, in army pants and a bright mustard helmet, sitting there atop the most outrageous, gleaming solid-rocket booster of a motor bike you've ever seen - well, that's just too much. talk about dachismo! the image makes the point nicely: the razorfish boys run their lives like they run their business - with total zeal for the user experience. the slipper room, the ducati, the den with seven shades of red, kravis, courtney, and taking your parents to europe for the first time on the concorde - it's all part of enhancing the \"comprehensive, cross-platform, cross-device, cross-network gestalt\" of dachis and kanarick's lives. and if the phenomenon of jeffncraig's ultimate \"user experience\" is off-putting to wall street, their competitors, or their neighbors in silicon alley, well, the guys think they know why.\"it's going to piss people off more if i say, 'it's because they're jealous,'\" kanarick says. \"but that could be part of it.\""}
