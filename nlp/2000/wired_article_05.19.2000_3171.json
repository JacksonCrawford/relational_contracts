you find that these cell phones are running this wap stuff!\"wap phones, already on sale in europe, should reach the u.s. in a few months. in finland, you can use your nokia to purchase a coke; in switzerland you can buy lift tickets on your vodafone smart phone.and while the wap forum and the w3c (the main organizer of www9) each say they are working closely together, nokia and ericsson are not going to sit around scandinavia waiting to sell phones while academics in cambridge, massachusetts, discuss how they should serve web content.if nothing else, closer ties to the academics affiliated with w3c should bring better science -- which can only help their marketing efforts.consider this tidbit from eija kaasinen, a researcher with vtt information technology in finland. the second most popular place to use wap cell phone services -- as opposed to voice conversations -- is right at home on the couch.\"they use them to keep from having to be mobile,\" she said.another question concerned which form factor to use for mobile web services. nokia's gsm-based phone-pda combination, the communicator, took several hits in sessions because of its bulky size as compared with newer, slimmer models. but biased communicator fan h\u00e4kan mitts of nokia's mobile phone division said the only time he doesn't carry his is when he goes snowboarding.\"i'm such a bad snowboarder, that i fall a lot, and when i fall on my big phone, it hurts,\" he said.other than mobility, another major trend seemed to be that \"push\" is back, in more ways than one. first, push in the form of emerging standards like rss (rich site summary) was a hot topic in some of the xml presentations. don't be fooled by the fact that the public, commercial web is all about money; the folks who write the standards are information junkies.push proponent pointcast may be an old memory, but these folks are more than ready to try out other systems where, with some luck, the information they want finds them.push is also coming to a phone near you. big web pages coming down the pike may be tied to the old days of desktop push, but the companies promoting wap are betting you'll take it on your cell phone -- especially for things like traffic or stock price news.on the final day of the conference, after the suits from the consumer electronics companies were back in the office, the diehards kept hammering away. friday was reserved for hands-on explanations of tools and technologies for developers.at 5 p.m. friday, as the rai conference center staff was ready to kick them out, berners-lee and four other panel members were eager to keep talking about an esoteric scheme called semantic web. it would add complexity to the tagging process in order to give online information more meaning. semantic relationships between systems could better automate the ways they share information.but figuring out how to define the systems will surely take -- oh no! -- a whole lot of long meetings in cities all over the world and hundreds of thousands of messages on mailing lists.the relief is almost palpable: now that the guys from philips and ericsson have taken their powerpoint presentations and gone home, we can start to have some real fun!"}
