here's a look at three prominent ones. tomb raider iv \ufffd the last revelation (eidos interactive) - $44.95believe it or not, there are some people who enjoyed this series of games for the adventure and not its pneumatic starlet, although that seems to be a relatively small percentage of the game's fans. tomb raider has always been a fun game if you are into puzzle solving and can put aside the fact that lara croft is, well, you know....the fourth installment of the franchise has lara in a single environment this time. previous games had lara hopping all around the world in various locales, but this time, lara spends all of her time in egypt.tr4 has two major flaws that kill any and all enjoyment of the game. the first problem is the terrible overuse of darkness. the game is almost pitch black from the very beginning and you find yourself bumping around in total blackness. there are flares for lighting, but they don't last and give off very little light.the other problem is the impossible puzzles that take hours to solve or make you constantly reload a saved game when you die. one extremely annoying underwater passage has a hidden exit that forces you to die before you find the exit through sheer dumb luck. other times you simply stumble around in the dark, burning up your limited supply of flares.the game is not fun at all, and it's not even as though eidos has run out of ideas. they simply executed it very badly.revenant (cinematix, for eidos interactive) - $39.99revenant is one of the more fun role-playing games simply because of the premise. rather than you as the good guy, hero-on-a-white-horse type, you play locke d'averam, a long-dead warrior plucked from hell (which means you weren't a nice guy) to save an island from a fanatical cult and rescue the king's daughter.the subplot has d'averam trying to regain memories of his past life and who he really was. don't expect much help from the townsfolk, because they weren't happy with his resurrection. but playing a bad guy hero is actually a kick here, since you don't have to be so sugary sweet and nice. none of this avatar junk in \"ultima\" -- you pack a sword and an attitude.combat is decent, with some amusing combinations of weaponry and martial arts. at one point, you enter unarmed combat with a monster who uses pro-wrestling moves, like a powerbomb and a suplex.but there are two annoying problems. the first is the landscape. locke frequently gets stuck on a rock or tree, and can't get out if his sword is drawn. you have to sheath it and walk out of the area. in combat, that means you are dead. another problem is that the game continuously loads maps as you progress. no one wants a game to pause in mid-battle while a map loads. that's poor design.but overall, it's a fun rpg with a twist. there is a multiplayer option, so four players can go head-to-head and fight to send each other back to hell.quake iii arena (id software, for activision) - $49.99the boys are back in town. the company that popularized smooth scrolling games is back with its latest in carnage, and it's no exaggeration to say this is their finest work -- on every technical level. the new graphics engine adds some nifty features that would be really great to stop and admire if you weren't so busy fighting for your life.curved, almost organic walls, mirrors, and teleporters you can see through are just a few of the pretty sights in the game. at the same time, the art work is at its most intricate now that they are supporting 32-bit color. the level design, while totally impractical in the real world, is perfect for what this game is designed for, and that's death matches.therein lies its weakness. q3a was designed for death-matching, with some bots thrown in for the individual player. they didn't even bother with a basic plot like in the first two games.after awhile, it gets old and redundant. whether it's against the bots or humans, with no plot to the game, going to another level is simply mixing things up to keep things from getting boring.id remains a one-trick pony, and it does that one trick better than anyone else. but technical superiority isn't the be-all, end-all. \"half-life\" and \"kingpin\" use an older game engine licensed from id, but they offer a depth of play that goes beyond just killing. there's no doubt carmack and company are smart enough to create a game with the depth of \"half-life\" or the complexity of \"kingpin.\" the question is, will they ever try?"}
