    "text": "is this the lady ada, countess of lovelace, is the subject of at 28 lady augusta ada byron king, daughter of english poetic genius lord byron, became the world's first computer programmer in london in 1843 when she developed the mathematical and theoretical designs for babbage's analytical engine, one of the world's first mechanical programmable computers.set in both victorian england and the us in the late 20th century, leeson's visually curious tale weaves back and forth across the boundaries of time/space, hardware/software, and masculine/feminine themes as we experience ada's tumultuous years theorizing and developing concepts for babbage's invention. at the same time, she is married to an earl and has a brood of children - making her the world's first supermom.the film's contemporary story line features artificial-life researcher emmy (francesca faridany), who becomes pregnant and manages to communicate with ada's mind via a dna memory chip her mentor gives her. these contacts make ada think she's delusional or insane.cameo appearances by the late timothy leary as sims, emmy's virtual computer science professor, and john perry barlow as a cryptological-mathematics tutor and one of ada's many lovers, reference the film to today's cyberculture.digital video and film techniques are cleverly blended in the form of virtual sets and places using bluescreen technologies. while this is not a new process, leeson's use of the special effect succeeds artistically where more amateur or fuzzier attempts have failed.conceiving ada street cred <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=3\">phone talk</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=4\">on priests of nature</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=5\">rings of truth</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=6\">videogame history 101</a>sorceress of software<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=8\">the return of camp</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=9\">echoes of a community</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=10\">affirmations barbie</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=11\">wormbo</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=12\">online interpreter</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=13\">economics 1, humanity 0</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=14\">maximize the medium</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=15\">readme</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=16\">not all sex is bad sex</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=17\">driving creative business</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=18\">colors for your pad</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=19\">contributors</a>"
