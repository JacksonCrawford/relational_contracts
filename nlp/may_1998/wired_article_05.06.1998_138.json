    "text": "it's the one biometrics, the digitization of unique physical characteristics such as fingerprints, retinal patterns, and voiceprints, has become increasingly popular as a way of confirming identity. some jurisdictions already use such data to track prison guards and inmates. businesses -- notably banks and supermarkets -- are beginning to use biometric devices to identify customers. the industry is becoming big enough that technology companies last week the technology, and the privacy issues it raises, is drawing interest from legislators, too: a bill in the california assembly would regulate the industry and make the sale of biometric data a crime.\"the big thrust is to prevent a secondary market [from developing around] biometrics,\" said the bill's author, ed howard, director of the los angeles-based under the bill, wrongdoers can be fined up to us$5,000 for each individual identity involved in a data sale. since direct marketers buy and sell social security numbers and mothers' maiden names, howard said it's reasonable to assume some companies will try to do the same thing with biometric data.there's also a fear that criminals will use the information to get access to personal records and accounts, or to impersonate someone. in most cases, biometric data of your baby blues, for example, is not stored as a visual image but as mathematical data representing the configuration of your unique retina or iris.\"the promise of biometrics is not yet compromised.... this is a new, safe way to identify consumers, but at the same time, it poses a threat,\" said howard. \"legislating in high technology is like shooting skeet. you have to aim a little ahead of the target.\"randy fowler, chief executive of privacy will be better protected through biometrics, he said, because it's a more unique form of identification than, say, a social security number. fingerprints in an identix database can only be verified with pattern-matching algorithms stored in a silicon chip, fowler said. like others in the industry, he said encryption is used to protect all the zeros and ones that make up the fingerprints.the problem with such assurances, howard said, is that \"there is no such thing as a completely secure system.\"identix devices run anywhere from $40,000 for a top-of-the-line forensic fingerprinting workstation, to $100 for a fingerprint recognition unit that can be built into a computer mouse. identix has sold its deluxe forensics machines to police departments in 29 states. also among its customers: banks, the us defense department, and the immigration and naturalization service.the california assembly bill, sponsored by los angeles democrat kevin murray, would require companies to give notice that biometric identification is required. it outlaws capturing such information without consumer consent, including surreptitious recording of voiceprints over the phone. it also says companies can't discriminate on the basis of race, gender, or geography when collecting biometric information.the bill also seeks to stop state government agencies from sharing biometric information with each other unless they have the individual's consent."
