    "text": "only about six  meanwhile, netscape's web site lists 6,000 internet-related titles, and one online bookstore offers two dozen texts relevant to the number 90210. but there is justice in the world: leonard herman has written and published an updated edition of phoenix: the fall &amp; rise of videogames. this labor of love offers a definitive temporal overview of joystick jiggling, covering the ups and downs of the phenomenon from 1962's protogame spacewar! to antigamer us senator joe lieberman. phoenix is no nintendo babylon; the book mostly covers videogames from the consumer's perspective, one new cartridge at a time. herman treats popular favorites and dismal flops with even-handed reverence, rarely injecting opinion that could color the facts in any way. i quickly became impatient trudging through such unwavering gray text and read most of the book like i would a reference guide: looking up k-tel international's double-ender xonox cartridges, then browsing forward, backward, and sideways for other postdated treasures. herman's shopping list of obsolete systems and unlikely peripherals includes my personal favorite lost cause: nintendo's epilepsy-inducing virtual boy. other innovations and oddities include the first uses of off-screen space (battlezone and defender, 1980), experiments with bioelectricity (atari's mindlink, 1984), and the creation of a functional spellchecker for the handheld game boy (infogenius, 1991). between these milestones and misfires runs a litany of litigation that could have had pac-man gobbling tums. instead, videogames survived to spawn a us$15 billion-a-year industry. it seems appropriate that their definitive history is written by a lone button masher.  street cred <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=3\">phone talk</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=4\">on priests of nature</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=5\">rings of truth</a>videogame history 101<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=7\">sorceress of software</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=8\">the return of camp</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=9\">echoes of a community</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=10\">affirmations barbie</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=11\">wormbo</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=12\">online interpreter</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=13\">economics 1, humanity 0</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=14\">maximize the medium</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=15\">readme</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=16\">not all sex is bad sex</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=17\">driving creative business</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=18\">colors for your pad</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=19\">contributors</a>"
