    "text": "sacramento, california - on monday, prosecutors will haul kaczynski back into the spotlight for what may be the last time as he is formally sentenced in federal court for one of the wiliest us terrorist campaigns.in january, kaczynski, 55, the plea bargain ended a trial teetering on the brink of chaos as kaczynski repeatedly disrupted proceedings. but it also blocked government prosecutors from presenting their full case against a man who taunted and eluded federal investigators for an unprecedented 16 years.monday's court session will give them one last chance, and they plan to take it by presenting testimony from before the prison gates swing shut on kaczynski forever, prosecutors want the world to take one last look into the mind of the former university mathematics professor who turned into one of the most notorious mad bombers.the prosecution took the for instance, although kaczynski publicly declared his mail bombs were designed to jolt society out of its love affair with technology, in at least one diary entry he reveals a more personal motive.\"i certainly don't claim to be an altruist or to be acting for the 'good' (whatever that is) of the human race,\" he wrote. \"i act merely from a desire for revenge.\"kaczynski told his diary that he loathed everybody from the airline pilots who disturbed his hermit life by flying over his cabin, to communists who, he said, \"threaten freedom.\"that hatred of people and extreme paranoia stems from mental illness, kaczynski's defense attorneys say. a court-appointed psychiatrist supported the claim that kaczynski was a sick man when she diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic last january.shortly afterward, prosecutors accepted kaczynski's plea bargain. although kaczynski's bombing campaign may have been motivated by mental illness, said paul mattiuzzi, a forensic psychologist who regularly examines disturbed criminals, it doesn't erase his culpability.\"there are basically a lot of people who are mentally ill who commit crimes,\" mattiuzzi said.\"their mental illness does not impact their capacity to know what they were doing -- to know that it was wrong.\"kaczynski himself took full responsibility for his lethal campaign against university professors and business executives. in fact in his journals he criticized himself if he \"chickened out\" of any attacks.far from seeking a mental-defect defense in court, he apparently dreaded being written off as a \"sickie.\" he railed in his journal that \"these days it is fashionable to ascribe sick-sounding motivations ... to persons who commit antisocial acts. perhaps some will deny that i am motivated by a hatred for what is happening to freedom.\"\"however,\" he concludes, \"i think i know myself pretty well and i think they are wrong.\"kaczynski violently ironically, they may have set the stage monday for a punishment kaczynski will find even more miserable than death. before his capture he once noted in his journal, \"i've always considered death preferable to long imprisonment.\"the convicted serial killer "
