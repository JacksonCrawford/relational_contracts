    "text": "with the european on saturday, european union leaders agreed that 11 nations -- germany, france, italy, spain, the netherlands, belgium, austria, portugal, finland, ireland, and luxembourg -- will begin using the currency on 1 january 1999.that decision will simultaneously create one of the planet's most powerful economic players and create both a challenge and opportunity for firms outside the bloc. the conventional wisdom is that those able to get up to speed quickly on euro transactions will hold the inside track over competitors who fail to. one move signaling the trend was microsoft's announcement last week that windows 98 and related software will incorporate the euro symbol to aid financial transactions in the new currency.another harbinger: a friday announcement from adpac that it is launching \"a lot of american companies haven't taken time to understand the implications of the euro,\" said ed severs, chief operating officer of the san francisco-based firm. \"but if you want to do business with companies or people in these countries as they go to the euro, they're going to give preferential treatment to companies that can handle the euro conversion.\"adpac, which specializes in re-engineering and compatibility conversion software for ibm mainframes, hopes to snag some business by offering software that will assist companies and accountants in analyzing and updating their digital financial records.nouriel roubini, a professor of economics and international business at nyu's stern school of business, agrees there's a payoff at the end of the euro tunnel.\"all sorts of companies, both european and american, will have to deal with some costs to make sure that their accounting and computer systems can handle the change, and these will be very high, one-time costs,\" he said. \"but then you'll have a fully unified and integrated system, and you won't have to maintain 12 or 15 different methods of accounting.\"since europe collectively represents america's largest trade and investment partner, the currency conversion is expected to have a broad impact here as american companies that do business in europe are forced to implement new (and possibly dual) accounting formulae.until 2002, companies in the member countries will be allowed to continue doing business simultaneously in \"old\" currency and the new euro. the resulting accounting and technology issues are expected to cost between us$100 billion and $400 billion, according to gartner group london."
