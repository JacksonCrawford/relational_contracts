    "text": "while short on details on the partnership remain sketchy. but what's clear is that kodak, which is currently undertaking one of the broadest reorganizations in the company's 110-year history, recognizes that its success in a world of digital images depends less on new technology than on its ability to transform the way it does business.\"in the early days of digital imaging, kodak thought that the shift they had to make was from chemical technology to digital technology,\" said alexis gerard, publisher of the future image report, a digital-imaging industry trade publication. \"what's turned out to be much more challenging for them is to make the change from a culture of closed systems ... to an open-systems culture.\"kodak, which built a us$14.5 billion empire by making money at practically every step of the image-making process, can't hope to similarly monopolize the digital imaging market, with its reliance on a combination of technologies, media, services, and even telecommunications infrastructure.in recent years, kodak has been squeezed by foreign competition, primarily from japan's fuji photo film, in its core market of consumer film products. the company lost us$744 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 1997, and was forced to dump 16,600 employees -- one-sixth of its work force. while the company was able to post a profit for the first quarter of this year, its sales continued to slump.last november, the company set out on a \"turn-around plan\" that it said would shed $1 billion in costs.\"kodak is changing -- and will change -- as we create a business model to reduce our cost structure and enable us to grow,\" said george fisher, kodak's chairman and ceo, in a press conference last friday. \"our 1997 performance was unacceptable. so we're changing the way we do business.\"the rochester, ny-based company, which has rarely partnered with other companies in the past, is finding that the imaging market of tomorrow demands they cooperate with potential and real competitors -- which includes intel as well as motorola, hewlett-packard, and even appliance operating software start-up \"kodak is synonymous with film, and so the company needs to reposition itself in an age of filmless cameras,\" said ross ruben, an analyst at jupiter communications. \"it makes sense they're partnering with computer companies to gain insight into this world.\"the alliance with intel, which will be fleshed out later this summer, involves sharing patents as well as a pot of money -- some $150 million in marketing funds -- to promote digital imaging to consumers. the companies will also work together to bring digital-imaging tools to kodak photo labs around the country.\"we'll work with intel to upgrade our photo-finishing operations in the united states so that when you send your film in for photo finishing, you'll be able to get high-resolution scans for roughly the same cost and time as a traditional processing order,\" said willy shih, president of digital and applied imagery at kodak. picking apart the picture in addition to working with others, the company will be forced to choose its battlegrounds carefully.\"in the film arena, we have a vertically integrated operation, whereas in the digital world the industry is much more horizontally structured,\" shih said. \"so we have to select pieces of the value chain to compete in.\"according to analysts, the deal with intel draws a line in the sand even while the two companies join hands.\"a reasonable observer would assume they've worked out how they're going to cooperate as well as where they're going to compete,\" said gerard. \"kodak appears to be focusing on cameras and digitization services, while intel is focusing on the inner workings of the cameras.\"for kodak, that's a far cry from the company's traditional cash cow, film -- the medium of traditional photography. but digital media is expected to be a relatively unexciting, low-margin sub-market in digital imagery.in contrast, the market for digital cameras is expected to grow quickly, perhaps resulting in sales of as many as 14 million cameras by the millennium, according to jonathan cassell, senior analyst at dataquest. and profit margins on digital cameras are still lingering around 20 percent industry wide.most believe it'll be a long time before the majority of cameras sold are digital. but while consumers aren't necessarily buying the latest $800 digital camera, they're increasingly using digital images that are scanned from traditional film.\"the portion of digital images that originate from digital cameras is still very small,\" said steve hoffenberg, director of the digital photo systems advisory service at lyra research, a market research and trade publishing company.so kodak intends to capitalize on both image processing for digitally produced images as well as digitization services for pictures shot on traditional film.\"when you fill the world with digital images, it builds a whole range of downstream opportunities: print services, storage and communications services, poster prints, things like that,\" said shih. \"if we flood the world with people's pictures on cds, they'll use them for all kinds of different applications.\"analysts agree that the advent of digital imaging creates as many opportunities as it does challenges for kodak.\"the challenge is getting people to change the way they think about using images,\" said carl holec, senior imaging products analyst at associated research services. \"instead of taking pictures and printing the batch once and perhaps framing one, the challenge with digital imaging is more about getting people to interact more with images, getting them to use them on web sites, in email, on cards and such.\"\"the name of the game is to gain control over people's memories,\" said gerard. \"and that's what kodak's focusing on.\"by picking up friends like intel and focusing on a few details of the overall picture of digital imaging, kodak hopes to make its \"kodak moment\" last."
