    "text": "the us house supporters said the \"the days of the high-flying satellite monopoly are numbered,\" said house commerce committee chairman tom bliley (r-virginia), who co-sponsored the bill with representative ed markey (d-massachusetts).the bill was passed on a 403-16 vote and moves on to the senate.the bill encourages privatization of the international telecommunications satellite organization by 1 january 2001 and privatization of the international maritime satellite organization by 1 january 2002. it would tie privatization to the companies' ability to provide services such as high-speed internet access in the united states.the bill also calls on private firms to get direct access to the international satellite organizations. that would end the current requirement that they go through comsat, the communications satellite corp., which was created by congress in 1962 with a charter to form a consortium to operate an international commercial satellite system."
