    "text": "one of the \"there is not a speech i give or a meeting i have in which i don't say to the industry: 'look, you need to be really, really careful about price increases,'\" decker anstrom of the national cable television association told the associated press in an interview at the industry's annual convention in atlanta. \"we know there is a sensitivity there both with our customers as well as policymakers.\"under current federal law, the federal communications commission is scheduled to relinquish its oversight of the cable industry on 31 march 1999. legislation has surfaced in congress, though, that would continue the fcc's regulatory role.the industry has a long history of price increases well above the overall rate of inflation. in the 12 months ending 31 march, cable tv rates rose 7.9 percent, the fcc says. the consumer price index was up 1.4 percent during the same period.- - - spectrum wars: \"if they want to play spectrum hog, i think it is almost sucidical for them,\" the associated press quoted malone as telling reporters at the convention. \"i think it would be very foolish for them.\" malone's words appear to be more than just rhetoric: last week, it announced a deal with general instrument for 5 million digital set-top boxes that will not be able to convert the cbs and nbc signals.the networks haven't had a lot to say about tci's stand. one reason, acknowledged by malone himself: under current federal rules for analog tv, cable companies are required to carry local broadcasters' signals. if the same regime is adopted for digital tv, tci won't have any choice but to carry the network signals.- - - tci and windows ce: the companies first unveiled a tentative agreement in early january and have worked since to hammer out the details. terms were not disclosed, but analysts estimated at the time that tci may pay as much as us$25 per box to have the equipment supplied with microsoft software.the new version of windows ce was specifically developed for use with tci's digital set-top boxes, the companies said in a joint statement. the tci boxes will include cable modems, allowing users to get high-speed internet access through their televisions."
