    "text": "washington -- senate slade gorton of washington state called the utah lawmaker's remarks \"nonsensical\" and said he was \"completely outraged\" by them. hatch, a friend of microsoft foe novell, was not immediately available to respond.the barbs on capitol hill again reflected an increasingly tense atmosphere surrounding microsoft as state attorneys general -- and possibly the justice department -- are on the cusp of filing new legal action against the software giant.at issue was a hatch said through a spokeswoman that the letter made it appear \"that microsoft is contacting potential witnesses and urging them to voice public opposition to possible law enforcement actions.\"hatch, his spokeswoman said, found it \"troubling that the target of an investigation might be using its relationship [with computer-makers and others] to encourage [witnesses] to participate in a public relations campaign seemingly designed to frustrate legitimate efforts to enforce the laws.\"gorton responded to his fellow republican with unusual fury.he said through a spokesman that he was \"completely outraged that the chairman of the judiciary committee would suggest that 26 high-tech ceos should not be able to exercise their first amendment rights and defend themselves against unwarranted intervention.\"and he said that for hatch to \"presume that he knows more about the high-tech industry and what they need than the 26 ceos ... is nonsensical.\"a microsoft spokesman said, \"the letter speaks for itself,\" and added that hatch may have been misinformed about the letter."
