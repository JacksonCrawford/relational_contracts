    "text": "first there's the mattel's new talk with me barbie doll (hairbrush included) knows how to get girls going. for instance, 8-year-old katie was close to uncontainable throughout the setup process. \"her outfit is like ginger spice!\" katie enthused. and, \"no underpants!\" as the batteries were being installed in the doll's back and thighs.barbie's own repartee, however, won't necessarily keep your girl juices going. once \"programmed\" (barbie's stunning bejeweled choker is in fact an infrared sensor that downloads data from her \"computer,\" a pink-and-blue device plugged into your serial port), she'll repeat thousands of phrases that correspond to your tastes. select, for instance, volleyball as your activity, and she'll converse with you intimately about the day: \"katie, let's have a party after the game!\" or, with more girlish gusto: \"katie, you're an incredible volleyball player!\" still, gusto unflagging: \"katie, you're a great athlete!\" choose baby-sitting and barbie is equally supportive: \"katie, babies really love you\" and \"katie, you have beautiful green eyes.\"for kids not too self-esteem-challenged, however, these affirmations can get repetitive, and once you've clicked ceaselessly through the cd-rom's choices - dating, horseback riding, shopping, and more - and have graphically dressed your doll for each, there's not a whole lot left to this barbie but barbie herself.of course, in the end that's all most 8-year-old girls are really after. that, her hairbrush, and her silky long hair. street cred <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=3\">phone talk</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=4\">on priests of nature</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=5\">rings of truth</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=6\">videogame history 101</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=7\">sorceress of software</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=8\">the return of camp</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=9\">echoes of a community</a>affirmations barbie<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=11\">wormbo</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=12\">online interpreter</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=13\">economics 1, humanity 0</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=14\">maximize the medium</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=15\">readme</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=16\">not all sex is bad sex</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=17\">driving creative business</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=18\">colors for your pad</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=19\">contributors</a>"
