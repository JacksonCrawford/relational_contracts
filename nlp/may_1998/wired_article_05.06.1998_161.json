    "text": "the race to on wednesday, us west communications -- the baby bell headquartered in denver, colorado, that serves much of the midwest -- announced a partnership with dell computer corp. and cisco systems inc., saying they will introduce \"the nation's first mass market, multicity deployment of ultrafast internet service\" over asymmetric digital subscriber lines (adsl).dell will make cisco adsl modems available on certain dell dimension xps desktop personal computers this year.adsl modems give customers high-bandwidth internet access over standard telephone lines, and will allow customers to maintain an \"always-on\" digital connection to the internet. users would be able to browse the internet or make phone calls over the same line at the same time.the news comes just two days after monday's announcement from the us cable industry, which formed a \"there seems to be a direct relationship between the increasing numbers of cable modem customers and the increasing numbers of dsl announcements,\" said michael harris, president of kinetic strategies, a broadband internet research firm.us west has made a number of announcements hyping the deployment of dsl services, harris said, \"but they haven't delivered yet -- we're still waiting.\" and the same can be said of cable broadband service providers -- the hype has often preceded the service roll-out. @home network, for instance, predicted back in 1996 that it would have 1 million subscribers by 1997. but as of its most recent quarterly report, the cable net access company had just broken the 100,000 subscriber mark.even so, harris said cable services look to be hitting a critical mass. by his firm's count, there will be 500,000 cable internet subscribers in the united states and canada by the end of this year. there are currently about 200,000.that could be providing at least some of the incentive for the baby bells to keep making announcements. \"it's the old microsoft strategy -- if the product's not ready yet, announce it anyway and try to freeze up the market,\" harris said. \"[cable companies] are locking up some of the market the [baby bells] want to hold onto. this is a smart announcement by us west for that reason -- it creates confusion.\"but harris was quick to point that there is no reason us west shouldn't be able to deliver on its promises soon.us west has been more aggressive than the other baby bells at rolling out the equipment that allows dsl services, according to cisco and dell.\"us west is the only carrier in full deployment of adsl today in the us,\" said brendon mills, cisco's product manager for broadband customer premise equipment. \"they're at least a year or two ahead [of the other baby bells].\"by the end of may, us west will be offering a variety of adsl services in 20 cities in seven midwestern states, and by mid-1998, it promises to deliver services to an additional 20 cities.cisco's adsl modems allow users to receive voice and data services through a single phone line connected to a pc at speeds of up to 7 mbps, or nearly 125 times faster than standard 56-kpbs modems.but to truly deliver adsl on a large scale, the phone companies need to install new equipment in their central offices. this equipment -- digital subscriber line access multiplexers -- splits the data traffic out onto a data network rather than the standard voice network.the us west-dell-cisco announcement is perhaps the weightiest news on the adsl front since microsoft, intel, compaq, and other computer industry leaders formed a "
