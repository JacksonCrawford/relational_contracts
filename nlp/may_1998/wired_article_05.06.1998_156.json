    "text": "astronomers are mystified they said today that it far eclipsed a supernova -- the explosion of a dying star -- and was second only to the big bang in energy.\"the energy released by this burst in its first few seconds staggers the imagination,\" said shrinivas kulkarni, a professor at caltech.the gamma-ray explosion, first seen on 14 december, came from a galaxy known as grb 971214, which is about 12 billion light years from earth.\"for about one or two seconds, this burst was as luminous as all the rest of the entire universe,\" said caltech professor george djorgovski, whose team's findings were reported in the science journal but astronomers said they could not explain it.\"most of the theoretical models proposed to explain these bursts cannot explain this much energy,\" said kulkarni. he said it might have come from a rotating black hole, but \"on the other hand, this is such an extreme phenomenon that it is possible that we are dealing with something completely unanticipated and even more exotic.\""
