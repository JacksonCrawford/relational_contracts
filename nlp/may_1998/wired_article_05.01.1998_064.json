    "text": " games like ultima  online are grand social experiments in community building. there's just one little problem.  tonight, like every night for the past eight months, tens of thousands of players will log on to britannia, a fictional online universe. they'll come to embroider upon make-believe lives as healers, fighters, mages, and rogues. and they'll stay - up to four hours each - because of the seductive quality of pure immersion. zooming in from around the world, this nightly legion has made origin's so what's going on here? something out of the ordinary, beginning with the sheer dimensions of the playing field. ultima onlineuoequally important, and let us not forget britannia's emergent economy, another distinctive characteristic and the source of an extraordinary amount of strategizing, not to mention wardrobe acquiring, day in and day out. players can develop many skills and myriad ways to exploit them for cash. the result - a community that rewards obsessive dedication and reveals inner characteristics through worldly trappings in hyperreal-time - is something compelling. in fact, it's nearly irresistible.so what's the problem? a few weeks after but the true dilemma goes way beyond the bugs. johnny wilson, a huge fan of the now, wilson resorts to the classics to express his deep unhappiness with wilson's assessment is typical of the gaming-industry \u00e9lite. randy farmer, virtual-worlds pioneer and senior designer at electric communities, says, \"unfortunately, origin seems to have ignored many of the lessons that our industry has learned in the last 10 years of building online worlds. they're making the same mistakes that first-time virtual-world builders always make.\"what he means is that the people behind true, __ __ the white magic of the avatar ____ultima onlinegarriott had published his first role-playing game, *akalabeth,*in 1979, when he was 19. it was an early graphic adventure game for the apple iie, heavily influenced by his experiences playing after completing but his gamble paid off - big time. released in 1985, the series was heralded as a welcome alternative to the mindless violence of many computer games; lord british is an idealized father figure - strong and brave, patient and loving, wise and powerful - a suitable mien for the alter ego of the games' creator. garriott lives in a custom-built castle in austin, texas, where he collects medieval armor, ancient astronomical devices, and ritualistic african masks. he regularly attends fantasy-gaming conventions as lord british, dressed in full medieval regalia and proclaiming the gospel of __ the black magic of player-killers __garriott sees garriott wanted to highlight the virtues, yet he created an online world in which it's easy, tempting, and lucrative to commit lethal crimes. in fact, it is so simple to off a fellow traveler in britannia that the widespread gaming phenomenon of pking, or player-killing, has traumatized the realm. much of far from a place where virtue is rewarded, the kingdom is ruled by intimidation, power dynamics, and conspicuous consumption. pking to acquire worldly goods is the most lucrative career choice around. but that's not all. denizens who live in accordance with the eight virtues often find themselves not only poor, bored, and frustrated, but inadvertently punished by the laws of the land. these high-minded players toil in small-time professions, while players with highly developed combat skills reign supreme: they terrorize newcomers, kill for money, and broadcast their wealth and power by building huge castles. it's a tough place to be a noble avatar.it should be noted, however, that there is life after death in britannia. when players die, they become ghosts and must follow one of several paths to resurrection, from visiting a shrine to receiving a high-level spell from a traveling companion or a healer, one of a handful of nonplayer characters programmed into the game.but the low road remains far too tempting. chris hawley is a high school student who's logged many hours playing hawley bought bored, hawley started to explore other aspects of the game. while practicing magic, he mistakenly cast some spells in town, which left him marked as an evil player. the next day, defending himself against an attack, he mistakenly targeted the wrong player, further darkening his reputation.within the span of a few days, he had fully embraced the dark side and quickly earned the title of dread lord. he could no longer enter the towns, and newcomers ran in fear when he approached. but much to his surprise, he started having a really great time. \"being a bad guy is loads of fun - there's more to do, more options to explore. you still get to hang out with lots of great people and help them out, but you're helping out other dread lords like yourself. and many of them are more interesting than the good-guy players i used to hang out with.\"as it happens, this is consistent with garriott's original vision for online gaming. \"when we first launched this dynamic works, as long as everyone is playing the same game. but what happens when players who think they're attending an online renaissance faire find themselves at the mercy of a violent, abusive gang of thugs? in today's britannia, it's not uncommon to stumble across groups of evil players who talk like snoop doggy dogg, dress like gangstas, and act like rampaging punks.when garriott was asked to respond to disillusioned very monarchial, you might say. but this regal perspective is harder to maintain outside the castle walls, where pking has become almost as ubiquitous as it is in the anti-pk backlash resulted in an epiphany of sorts: the paradox of violence in online worlds is that while it generates moral outrage, it also encourages players to band together into tightly knit groups of trusted comrades. these groups - tribes, clans, families, or guilds - are what britannian culture, and perhaps online culture in general, is really all about.__ the tribes __there are already more than 420 member-created guilds in britannia, and the number is rising. not surprisingly, guild wars are becoming a popular pastime.guilds are not unique to but the guilds of britannia, which range in size from 3 to 300, are more numerous and varied than those of other games. the yew town council is a nascent civil society reminiscent of the knights of the round table, formed in direct response to pking. a powerful adventurer donated 50,000 gold pieces (a sum that would, incidentally, take a tailor weeks to earn) and a warship, which was recently christened in a formal ceremony that also instituted an initial code of honor. the britannian thespians league, on the other hand, is preparing to introduce a new kind of play to britannia: it is building sets, holding auditions for actors, and writing a script that's loosely based on \"the emperor's new clothes.\"then there are the guilds reminiscent of the elks club in its heyday. mohdri dragon is a longtime member of the talons of justice, which migrated to after a few moments, three powerful-looking characters emerged from lord william's chambers. they were dressed alike, in full-body armor with matching dark-green robes and sashes. \"you can go in now,\" one of them said. \"the transaction is complete.\"mohdri and darkstarr entered the room and bowed before lord william, who was sitting behind an imposing desk. after chatting for a few moments, lord william said, \"unfortunately, i must take your leave. we have just formed an alliance with the guardians of the sacred order, and they have invited us to attend a swearing-in ceremony for their newest members.\" he paused for a moment, assessing darkstarr's trustworthiness. \"you are welcome to join us, milady, for this auspicious occasion.\"lord william led the group to the meeting with the guardians of the sacred order, but he didn't have far to go. lord randolph, the order's chief, created a magical moongate that teleported all of us to the throne room, deep inside the gated castle of lord british.the ritual unfolded with dignified solemnity. the members of each guild, looking quite splendid in their matching outfits, lined up for inspection. lord randolph took the stage and made a heartfelt speech. one by one, the new recruits came up to be sworn into the brotherhood. they bowed, drank a sip of ceremonial wine, and each received a dark-green sash to signify their new status.then the partying began. someone had brought a cake, and even darkstarr added two hams, which she brought in her backpack, to the feast. bottles of champagne were passed around, causing some new members to speak loudly and bump into each other. the two clans intermingled, discussing how they could help each other defend their homesteads. it was late when lord william graciously thanked darkstarr for coming, and mohdri kindly escorted her back to town.the next evening britannia taught darkstarr another lesson - one without the formality of the preceding exchange. the insidious brotherhood is a group of bloodthirsty player-killers and dangerous religious fanatics. rumor has it that the guild worships the evil guardian, a character from the head of the insidious brotherhood, magical bubba, was adept at building consensus among his rowdy comrades - a skill that enabled him to turn this small band of evil characters into a lean, mean fighting machine. in the guild wars, the brotherhood oft vanquished guilds many times its size.at one point, things turned really ugly. in a display of brute force, bubba turned himself into a gorilla and threatened to sodomize xavori with a thigh bone taken from one of the victims. unintimidated, xavori cast a blazing firewall at bubba - but because of server lag (or perhaps bad aim) it hit darkstarr instead, killing her instantly.the hosts gathered around, staring down at the corpse in momentary dismay. one of them cried out, \"you've killed the reporter from roadkill. a fitting end, it would seem, for a journey through britannia these days. now, what about those eight virtues?"
