    "text": "as evidence that the first-draft documents of opencable are being released to vendors for review and comment, cablelabs said. they summarize the kind of services a set-top box must support and the technical features required to do so.rather than seeking a specific microprocessor or operating system, the consortium said that support for most interactive, cable-delivered services will come in the form of a \"middle layer\" of software, tapping well-worn internet specs such as html, cgi, and javascript. the cable industry also - - - phone via cable: the deal, worth a potential $100 million over three years, is part of the first phase of a deal the company and mediaone announced last december. adc says it is supplying the cable company with a telephony platform, homeworx.a transport system that integrates voice and high-speed data in a single common platform, homeworx calls for a digital terminal at the cable company \"head end\" and hardware for integrating services at the customer end.delivered via hybrid fiber/coaxial cables, the system is based on a technology called orthogonal frequency division mutiplexing. the company says homeworx accommodates delivery of telephony and internet access, but also leaves room for future interactive services delivered via cable.ultimately, adc sees the homeworx-enabled cable service bringing telephony to nearly one million mediaone subscribers.- - - webtv via cable box: currently, the plans call for the incorporation of both the webtv technology, as well as windows ce operating system, into the boxes. general instrument will use the dct-5000+ to supply approximately 15 million opencable-compliant boxes to 12 north american cable operators over the next three to five years, the company said."
