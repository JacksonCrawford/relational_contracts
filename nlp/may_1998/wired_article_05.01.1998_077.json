    "text": "five years ago, \"there was a lack of skilled support personnel for the networks, both in knowledge and in numbers,\" said ward, who soon found himself putting together seminars and training programs in the schools to bring support staff up to speed.what began as one man's effort to train staff for school networks has blossomed into an ambitious international program to provide professional training for an entire generation of students. cisco hopes this will help fill some of the vacant information technology jobs that have so many people in the computer industry worried.at a press conference on capitol hill in washington, dc, last october, cisco officially launched the this week, cisco added the fremont and walnut creek, california, campuses of silicon valley college to a roster of cisco networking academies that are rolling out in 27 us states and territories, as well as in venezuela, canada, and australia.when ward originally put together the training programs, he found they only solved half the problem -- getting the adult staff up to speed in the schools. \"the other half of the problem was the sheer numbers of people that were needed,\" ward said. \"so we began looking at whether or not the students were a viable option. ultimately, i decided that they learn the technology as fast, if not faster than the adults -- and they're good. so i decided that we should look at creating the cisco networking academies program as it exists today.\"estimates of information-technology job vacancies in the united states -- which have ranged wildly from 190,000 to 340,000 -- gained official recognition last summer when the us commerce department issued a the true extent of the it worker shortage problem has since been questioned, however. in march, congress's general accounting office (gao) issued a report but to ward, the squabbling over the intricacies of the data is a waste of time. \"the bottom line is that they can debate it all they want, but when you start looking at the actual companies, they all have a shortage of skilled workers and openings that they can't fill,\" said ward. \"and that's coming from an engineer's perspective, not a politician's.\"ward said the program is on track to be in place in more than 1,000 high schools, community colleges, and technical schools by this fall. the program has been adopted by both virginia and wisconsin as an official state initiative, according to kevin warner, senior manager of cisco's education market development group.said ward: \"i could see 2,000 or 3,000 schools in the united states teaching this curriculum in the next 12 to 18 months.\"cisco chairman john morgridge called the program \"the 'shop' of the 21st century\" when it was officially launched in october. \"it's the first true partnership between schools, government, and business since the days of high-school 'auto shops,'\" morgridge said in a press release. \"the difference is, instead of auto mechanics, students learn the conceptual and practical skills necessary to design and manage networks.\"the curriculum -- which takes 280 hours of classes to complete (during four semesters) -- includes instruction in tcp/ip, ethernet, routed and switched networks, and standard local area network technologies. to graduate and become a cisco-certified networking associate, students must pass a certification exam administered by a third-party testing service.graduates should then have the design, implementation, and troubleshooting skills for roughly 70 percent of the computer networks in the world, ward said.the curriculum is cisco-designed and taught on cisco equipment, but ward said it is not intended to categorize students as cisco-only engineers. \"the curriculum is designed to teach all major standards concepts,\" ward said. \"a lot of the curriculum is skills based, and when they're doing their lab work, it is on cisco equipment. but can they take that knowledge and apply it to other equipment? absolutely. we're not really pigeonholing them to a particular vendor.\"as regional centers, the two campuses of silicon valley college, a two-year technical school, will act as the training hubs for a group of 10 local academies. cisco donates equipment -- including routers, network hubs, and web servers -- to each regional center and underwrites the cost of training two instructors.the regional centers, in turn, establish relationships with the local academies, which cisco helps enlist. in silicon valley college's case, it will train teachers from public and private high schools. the teachers will take summer courses to learn the curriculum, and then can teach it to their students during the school year.\"networking technology will be an important sector for years to come; introducing it to high school students is important,\" said mark millen, silicon valley college's director of academic affairs. \"there is high demand for people with these types of skills, and because there is a demand, the salaries are good. we want to be a part of providing that opportunity to the community.\"millen said silicon valley college will charge teachers of the local academies an as-yet undetermined tuition to offset its own costs. the regional center also looks forward to the prospect of attracting more students to its rolls down the road, such as workers interested in changing careers.cheryl mendonsa, director of strategic planning for the us commerce department's technology administration, said this is exactly the type of program the government would like to support.\"we all need to be in a lifelong learning mode these days,\" mendonsa said. \"the more you have these types of partnership programs, with junior colleges and local businesses, the more opportunity people have to stay in that learning mode.\"cisco is not alone in its initiative to train it workers. microsoft, novell, and motorola, among others, all have training and accreditation programs. but the networking company might be unique in the scale of its efforts. if ward is right in his projections, and each school graduates 20 certified networking engineers per class, the program could eventually turn out 40,000 graduates per year.\"for one company to reach out to that many schools is unique,\" said mendonsa. \"i haven't heard of any others doing it on that scale.\"cisco made an initial investment of us$18 million in curriculum, equipment, and resources. at any one time the company has between 15 and 20 people working on the program, according to senior manager warner.but cisco says the investment is well worth it. \"it's a win-win situation,\" said ward. \"the schools get the trained support people they need to support their networks, and industry gets a trained workforce that is immediately employable.\"the first graduating class comes out of the program later this month at thurgood marshall high school in san francisco."
