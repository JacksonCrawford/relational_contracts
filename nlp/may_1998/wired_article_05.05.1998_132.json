    "text": "washington -- many \"we're concerned about the potential disruption of power grids, telecommunications, and banking services\" among other possible fallout, especially in countries already torn by political tensions, said sherry burns, who is heading the agency's study of the problem.she said cia systems engineers and intelligence analysts were focusing beyond the technical problem of reprogramming computers to recognize dates beyond 1 january 2000. instead, the spy agency has begun collecting and analyzing information on preparations for the \"social, political, and economic tumult\" that could flow from interruptions of essential services in some fragile societies.according to the cia assessment, the threat of turmoil is greatest among those unaware of the key role that bits and bytes play in providing essential services and bringing goods to markets, even in less-developed countries.\"as you start getting out into the population, i think most people are again assuming that things are going to operate the way they always have,\" burns said. \"that is not going to be the case.\"many governments are \"unprepared for what could potentially be some fairly tough circumstances,\" she added.in an initial effort to gauge preparations, the cia received a wide range of feedback during the past year, not all of it very encouraging, burns said.one overseas contact said his country would be safe because it used a \"different calendar.\" others acknowledged the issue was not on their radar scope. someone from a middle eastern country told the cia not to worry about any bug.\"when we see it, we'll spray for it,\" burns quoted that source as saying.she said canada, britain, and australia were about six months behind the united states in preparing their systems for the switch, and that this was the group in the best shape.the rest of western europe, led by the scandinavians, came next, six to nine months behind the united states.europe's job is compounded by the need to reprogram millions of computers for next january's introduction of the euro, the new unified currency already adopted by 11 nations.the cia feels that europe will probably be unable to complete both reprogramming jobs in an effective and timely manner, burns said.japan, china, hong kong, and most other pacific rim countries were \"maybe nine months to a year behind in terms of where the work should be,\" burns said. she put russia in the same category. latin america was \"way behind the power curve.\"as part of the agency's increased interest in the y2k program, some cia employees have been briefed on preparing themselves individually for potential fallout.they were being advised to pay their bills early in december 1999 to avoid possible processing problems, keep cash on hand in case automatic teller machines failed, and lay in extra blankets in case of a blackout on a cold new year's eve."
