    "text": "flanked by a \"this is a very serious situation,\" he said. \"any government action that would derail or delay windows 98 would hurt the american economy and would cost american jobs ... the effect would be profound and would ripple through the economy.\"gates' volley was the latest in microsoft's public effort to stop state and federal government attempts to break up microsoft's perceived control of the software industry.the federal government and microsoft are locked in a court battle in which the justice department has accused microsoft of violating an antitrust agreement related to the internet browser capabilities of its windows 95 operating system. and attorneys general of 14 states are investigating antitrust allegations at the state level.the rising heat in this battle between microsoft and what seems sometimes to encompass the entire world is probably because any action against the software company will have to happen soon, as windows 98 is scheduled to be released to pc-makers on 15 may.but microsoft's public relations machine hasn't won many friends with its increasingly heavy-handed message. senator orrin hatch (r-utah), chairman of the senate judiciary committee who held hearings earlier this year into microsoft's business practices, even went as far as to accuse microsoft of coercing executives to tuesday's event.\"it strikes me as curious that it was only after calls from microsoft that many of these individuals saw fit to sign letters and make public appearances,\" he said.after the news conference, connecticut attorney general richard blumenthal, one of the state officials investigating microsoft, said that microsoft's message to america may be backfiring.\"some arguments made by microsoft against government action seem to support the view that microsoft has excessive dominance that constitutes a stranglehold -- and has illegally exploited it -- since it is saying that windows 98 is so absolutely essential to the pc industry,\" he said in a statement.while he declined to say exactly what action the states might take, blumenthal said any action would be aimed at moves by microsoft that could \"harm consumers with higher prices and fewer choices.\""
