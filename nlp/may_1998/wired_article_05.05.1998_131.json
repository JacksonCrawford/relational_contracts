    "text": "officials from network last week's announcement at the hambrecht & quist technology conference is the latest in a series of preparations network solutions (nsi) has made as it battens down the hatches. competition could arrive as early as this fall, but for now, nsi still maintains an exclusive contract with the national science foundation as the sole registrar of the .com, .net, .org, and .edu domains.company officials refused to elaborate on the new services, which will include search-engine services, email, directory services, data and research services, and the ability to reserve domain names to register. ceo gabriel battista said he believes competition in the internet domain-name registration market is about six to 12 months away. in an interview, cfo robert j. korzeniewski said that these services will be available in the next three to six months.despite the seemingly radical redirection, the new nsi offerings did not shock most analysts. \"the real question is, do they have any fundamental advantage over someone else?\" said clay ryder, analyst at zona research. \"there may be an angle there. and being first goes a long way.\"\"we like to say we provide enabling services to the small business market so they can establish their brand on the internet, communicate with their customers, and conduct business,\" said cheryl regan, a spokeswoman at nsi, via email. \"we're planning a number of services to support these three needs. directory services and email fall within these offerings. all these activities are in preparation for competition that we have been anticipating for several years.\"regan's description fit the model that most analysts say nsi is shooting for. \"they have to ensure their corporation's survival, which implies a mutation into a different business,\" said larry dietz, analyst at zona research. \"this implies domain name [services], web-site design, analyzing traffic on your site, links to payment modules, digital signatures, credit-card processing -- a one-stop shopping center to set up your business.\"and there's no time like the present for ramp-up -- when you\ufffdre the only player.\"we believe it will never be as easy to increase our customer base as it is now,\" battista said at the conference, adding that he also saw much of that growth potential coming from outside the united states.hence the company's other recent moves, including the 22 april purchase of the texas-based idnames, which specializes in worldwide domain-name registration services in the two-letter country code, top-level domains.nsi is also targeting business-focused web sites to spread the brand. in january, nsi signed cross-marketing agreements with \"business sites will be the most likely candidates for needing a web presence,\" said richard miller, analyst at international data corp. \"it will be a universal necessity for anyone who wants to do business.\"indeed, battista said that the market potential exceeds 100 million domain names. miller's research indicates that the market will only continue to grow from 1.9 million us business homepages in 1997 to 12 million worldwide by the year 2000, given that 79 percent of businesses have yet to get online. miller's march report on network solutions says, \"if the [us]$35-per-year registration fee holds constant, domain registration will be a $431 million industry in the computerized business segment alone in 2000.\"nsi has a lot at stake here -- miller estimates that the company, whose revenues were $45.3 million last year, made 85 percent of that from domain name registration. and so most analysts agreed that the company is strengthening its brand as much as possible before d-day.\"it all depends on marketing, and ... nsi is partnering with isps and others to make its name paramount as the registrar for these domains,\" said miller, in an email. he continued, saying that these deals make it easy for internet service provider (isp) members to link to nsi's domain-name registration services. included among the 45 partners are gte internetworking, advanced internet technologies, and digiweb. but miller did not think that nsi will be affected much by the competition.\"in theory, the competition could come from anywhere in the 'registrar' space, because after 30 september 1998 any company will be able to register names with .com, .org, and .net. but i think the competition here will be minimal,\" said miller.he added that more competition could come from registries that focus on the new domains up for grabs, including .per, .web, and .frm. \"companies and people aren't registering real estate here, they're registering names. if the good names are gone in .com, they may elect to register elsewhere.\"if that's true, nsi could be in trouble. at the conference, battista said that most of nsi\ufffds growth -- around 90 percent -- comes from the .com domain. but karl denniger, president of the isp mcsnet, disagreed as to the lucrative nature of the market, and took a wait-and-see attitude about nsi's fate. according to denniger, it does not cost much to run a database and register names.\"the largest cost is opening the envelopes and cashing the checks in registration,\" he said. \"i think there is ... a market risk here to nsi based simply upon costs. those organizations that can operate with very low overhead are going to be able to drastically undercut nsi's fees. will that destroy their market share? i don\ufffdt know.\"most folks can't do more than speculate until next week, when \"duke of urls\" ira magaziner is expected to unveil a new us government plan for competition in domain-name registration.but miller concluded his report this way: \"network solutions' revenue will grow an annualized 48.5 percent over the next five years if it can maintain 70 percent of its current market share through 2002. at the very least, we believe that network solutions' role in the domain name registration industry should grow despite general sentiment that competition will encroach on its growth.\"reuters contributed to this report."
