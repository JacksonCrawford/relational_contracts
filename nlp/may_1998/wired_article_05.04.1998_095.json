    "text": "as the cable cable companies still garner the lion's share of revenues from traditional tv viewers tuning in to see hbo, cnn, and other stalwarts, but new digital technologies on the horizon offer opportunities to rake in big money for internet and telephone services.that has the top cable operators scrambling madly to hook up with high-tech companies. while few analysts expect major announcements at this week's national cable television association meeting in atlanta, wheeling and dealing among the various moguls will be rampant.microsoft chairman bill gates addressed the gathering today and urged the industry to speed the deployment of high-speed internet services.\"by taking the latest in hardware and software technology, the cable industry will lead the way to provide information-age services in all the homes in the world,\" gates said.microsoft and intel said today that they would back a cable-industry effort to promote the use of super-fast cable modems, dubbed the cable broadband forum. cable operators tele-communications inc. and time warner inc. are also backing the forum.cable companies are racing to offer new high-speed internet and telephone services, while traditional telephone companies are rolling out their own high-speed internet offerings that could eventually be used to offer cable television programming as well.microsoft, which has a us$1 billion investment in the fourth-largest cable operator, comcast corp., is playing both sides of the fence. in january, the software giant teamed with intel and compaq to back the telephone industry's new high-speed internet technology called digital subscriber line service.but gates sought to reassure cable operators that microsoft had no desire to displace them through control of operating systems software in new cable systems.\"there's no need for paranoia,\" gates said, promising cable operators that they would have complete control over how microsoft software appeared to their consumers.microsoft, sun microsystems, and oracle are battling for a place in the cable industry's next-generation software systems, while hardware manufacturers seek contracts for building cable modems and new set-top boxes.but similar new technologies are also being deployed by potential cable competitors. the baby bells, also with microsoft's blessing, recently announced plans to offer super-fast internet links over ordinary phone lines using a technique called digital subscriber line service.while aimed initially at the internet crowd, dsl and some new wireless services could eventually pose a challenge to cable's core business by offering video programming as well.in the short-term, however, the cable outlook is extremely positive, analysts said.some industry officials said they expected oracle would announce a major deal with the cable internet services roadrunner, owned by time warner, and mediaone express, owned by mediaone.but a spokeswoman for roadrunner declined to comment, adding that the company may not make any announcements at the conference. oracle did not returns telephone calls.time warner and mediaone, along with tele-communications inc., definitely plan at least one announcement. the firms said they are unveiling a joint initiative today to raise consumer awareness of cable internet connections."
