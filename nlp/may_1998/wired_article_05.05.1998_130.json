    "text": "florence, colorado -- one day after he was officially sentenced for an 18-year bombing campaign that killed three people and injured more than two dozen others, kaczynski was taken from his sacramento, california, jail cell, flown to pueblo, colorado, and transferred 30 miles to the federal penitentiary in this sleepy town in the foothills of the rockies. he was sentenced to four consecutive life terms, plus 30 years.at florence he passed through steel doors and was officially entered as an inmate at america's new alcatraz, the \"administrative maximum facility\" nicknamed \"the big one.\"kaczynski entered a grim world populated by the most violent and unrepentant criminals in the country.among his fellow inmates are oklahoma city bomber timothy mcveigh, mafia boss john gotti, israeli spy jonathan pollard, and charles harrelson, actor woody harrelson's father, who is serving a life term for murdering a judge.opened in 1994, florence has been hailed as being almost escape-proof, a high-tech stronghold that embodies the darkest nightmares of a technophobe like kaczynski.while the nation has other \"supermax\" jails designed for dangerous inmates, florence goes further.\"it will take einstein's genius and more than a little luck to get out of this baby,\" said architect john quest.designed with the help of computers, which were fed various escape scenarios, the facility combines the tightest external security with strict prisoner management -- a combination that has led some civil rights groups to protest that it is inhumane.situated on 37 acres, the jail is ringed by watchtowers and can hold 490 inmates. silent pressure pads, laser beams, and dogs that attack without barking are all located in the no-man's land between razor-wire fencing and the prison walls.convicts spend 23 hours a day in lock-up, and are only allowed outside of cells with leg irons and handcuffs. exercise time is extremely curtailed, and contacts with the outside world are kept to an absolute minimum.more than 10,000 computer-controlled electronic prison gates all close automatically if any escape attempt is detected. the cells are soundproofed to prevent prisoners from communicating with each other by morse code, and prison librarians examine every page of every book touched by an inmate to make sure no messages are inserted.in their cells, prisoners face a bleak world. the cells have no movable furniture, nothing that could possibly be used to attack a guard. the windows are all angled so that there are no views of the world outside."
