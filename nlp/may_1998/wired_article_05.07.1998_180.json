    "text": "at&amp;t and other \"there's an obvious need for a lot of cable to carry a lot of capacity,\" said at&t spokeswoman patricia robinson.scheduled for completion in 2000, the so-called japan-us cable network actually links two systems already under way in each nation. at a meeting of potential investors held in hawaii last month, the companies not only agreed to merge the networks but doled out 77 percent of the system's eventual capacity.the cable will employ wave division multiplexing, a technology that increases capacity, robinson said, by placing multiple wavelengths (colors) of light on a single fiber-optic strand. in simpler terms, this lets the cable carry \"an awful lot of calls,\" robinson said.the numbers associated with the trans-pacific link are impressive: 21,000 kilometers long, 80 gbps speed, and capacity for 967,680 simultaneous phone calls. that's compared to the current, maxed-out capacity of 320,000 simultaneous calls carried by current networks.the network will touch down in locales including hawaii and california in the united states, and ibaraki and chiba in japan.ultimately the system can be expanded to a stunning 7.7 million simultaneous calls and 640 gbps. that would give it the largest capacity in the region, at&t said.much of the traffic growth between the countries is due to internet information traveling back and forth, robinson said. frame relay traffic between business offices also represents a significant portion of the traffic growth.also in the works are plans for a chinese link scheduled to be ready by 1999, robinson said."
