    "text": "new york -- \"the fees we must pay the local monopolies to complete long-distance calls are at least eight to 10 times more than their actual costs,\" at&t chairman c. michael armstrong told a conference sponsored by the economic strategy institute. he said the cost difference \"amounts to a hidden tax of more than us$10 billion a year that long-distance customers pay to the local telephone companies.\"that windfall, he said, averages about 4 or 5 cents a minute on every long-distance call and that without it, long-distance fees \"could be that much lower.\"at&t wants the baby bells to be separated into wholesale businesses that complete calls for other carriers, and into retail businesses that sell services to customers. this proposal follows similar plans outlined by other long-distance companies, including lci international and mci.under the 1996 telecommunications act, the baby bells must open their local telephone market to competition before entering the long-distance market. the federal communications commission has rejected all four baby bell long-distance applications to date, saying the companies had not done enough to open local markets.in january, lci proposed a plan that would require the regional bells to separate their wholesale and retail activities into different operating units. mci said in march that the split must go further, asking for a total separation of the two sides of the business.the call by at&t and its long-distance counterparts are beyond the measures outlined by the telecom act. but at&t, mci, and lci said the extra steps may be needed to ensure fairness as baby bells try to enter the long-distance market.\"separating the bell companies' local networks from their other operations will ensure that the bell companies can't subsidize their competitive activities from the inflated fees they charge long-distance companies to have calls completed,\" armstrong said.such a move would further fragment the baby bells, which were created by the break-up of at&t in 1984."
