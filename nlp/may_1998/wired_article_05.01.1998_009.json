    "text": "versailles, france -- representatives of the four trading powers, meeting as the \"quad\" group, agreed to work together toward an agreement on global ecommerce in time for a world trade organization meeting in geneva on 18 may.in a communique issued after a one-day meeting, officials from the four nations said they would \"work to develop as soon as possible consensus on a standstill to preserve current practices of not imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions.\" this pledge fell short of the us wish to get an accord within the next month to ensure commerce conducted entirely over the internet stayed forever free of tariffs.the group's conclusions reflected the position of canada, which has proposed that wto countries agree to maintain the status quo until january 2000. but the quad communique did not state how long a standstill should last.canada's trade minister sergio marchi said that while some people proposed a permanent freeze on internet duties, others were concerned with understanding legal, social, and privacy issues before making a permanent decision.us officials have argued that the rapid development of electronic commerce should not be overshadowed by the prospect of tariffs being imposed on items like software, architectural plans, audiovisual products, or books that can be bought and downloaded over the internet. as it stands, no country has any system of exacting duties, but many of the wto's 132 member countries are wary of being rushed into an ironclad agreement."
