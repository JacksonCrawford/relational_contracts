    "text": "an argentine judge \"us authorities have told us the four are ready to give sworn testimony in the united states,\" federal judge adolfo bagnasco said in an interview today. \"but we don't want them as witnesses, we want them as suspects.\"the four suspects are robeli libero, ibm's former latin american president; peter rowley, vice president for marketing; and executives marcio kaiser and steve lew.\"they know they are implicated here, and that's why they don't want to come,\" bagnasco said monday night. \"if they don't come voluntarily to testify, i will have to ask interpol to capture them with or without the assistance of the us government.\"the judge said he would wait two weeks, after which his extradition efforts promise to mean years of legal battles in the united states, brazil, and perhaps other countries.the judge suspects bribes were paid in 1993 to win ibm a contract for a computer system for state-owned banco nacion. his fraud investigation involves 11 former officials of banco nacion, ibm argentina, and the argentine government.ibm argentina has denied any wrongdoing, although it has admitted to errors \"inconsistent with company policy.\"bagnasco said he wanted to question the four executives for alleged \"fraud against the state and bribery.\" he said he explained his wishes in a letter monday to thomas snow, international affairs director of the us department of justice.the judge said his letter was in response to one from snow demanding \"sufficient proof showing a crime took place.\"following three years' work, bagnasco said last month he was now sure there \"really was a criminal act,\" after swiss banks gave him names of account holders alleged to have received bribes.at the heart of the probe are payments made to ibm's subcontractor ccr, which bagnasco has said \"benefited from a $37 million deal\" he suspects went to alleged bribes. the judges believes ccr was used as a funnel for the alleged illegal payments. ccr was in charge of providing a backup computer system not included in the tender.the judge has asked us authorities to hand him information on a citicorp account in new york where money from ccr was transferred. he is also probing other banks' accounts.bagnasco has traced ccr's deposits for about $9 million in an account of a banque bruxelles lambert sa bank branch in geneva. at his request, the swiss supreme court lifted banking secrecy in august.banco nacion canceled the deal last year and sued ibm argentina. ibm then countersued and they reached settlement out of court. other ibm argentina contracts are the subject of separate probes."
