(the intelifone can only check its own isp at the axis's keyboard is a bit larger and more responsive than intelifone's. long emails may be easier to read on the axis, but they're not much easier to enter.i'm generally not a fan of dumbed-down computers, but these phones make a lot of sense for casual email users. forget about pc-tv mergers and get yourself wired for the email-phone convergence. street cred phone talk<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=4\">on priests of nature</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=5\">rings of truth</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=6\">videogame history 101</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=7\">sorceress of software</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=8\">the return of camp</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=9\">echoes of a community</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=10\">affirmations barbie</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=11\">wormbo</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=12\">online interpreter</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=13\">economics 1, humanity 0</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=14\">maximize the medium</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=15\">readme</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=16\">not all sex is bad sex</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=17\">driving creative business</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=18\">colors for your pad</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=19\">contributors</a>"
