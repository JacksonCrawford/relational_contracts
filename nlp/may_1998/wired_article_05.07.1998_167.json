    "text": "washington -- federal microsoft said late wednesday that it had asked a federal appeals court to overturn a preliminary injunction prohibiting the company from bundling its browser with windows 98.justice responded to redmond's motion thursday saying in its filing, that microsoft has had plenty of opportunity to ask for clarification on the matter, and in this late motion the company \"has advanced no valid reason for bypassing the district court.\"microsoft's motion, filed in the us court of appeals on tuesday, would have no effect on possible new legal action under consideration by both the justice department and state attorneys general. those actions, spurred by the sherman antitrust act, may be filed in a matter of days. the sherman act is aimed at preventing monopolies by proscribing unfair competition practices.meantime, the immediate action reportedly would include forcing microsoft to offer win98 sans browser, at a price that is proportionately reduced, and lifting microsoftian restrictions that force pc-makers to host an internet explorer icon on their computers' opening screens, allowing them instead to install the browser anyway they want. another possible long-term action is to seek \"a sort of affirmative-action program\" to help netscape recover from microsoft's allegedly illegal actions.but microsoft is troubled by more immediate issues. the company said it has a separate set of concerns because of the existing preliminary injunction, which microsoft microsoft said when it decided to appeal the decision, the release date for windows 98 was still uncertain, so no attempt was made to protect the new product. but with windows 98 shipping to computer-makers on 15 may, any legal delay now would be damaging, the company said. the new os is scheduled to be available to the public beginning 25 june.the december injunction bars microsoft from bundling its browser with windows. microsoft noted in its argument that the judge's injunction, as written, \"included windows 98.\" and so the company asked the appellate court seeking to stay the preliminary injunction as it applies to windows 98.\"in order to comply with the preliminary injunction insofar as it relates to windows 98, microsoft would have to create a whole new operating system that did not provide support for internet standards,\" the company said. it said that web capability was so central to windows 98 that removing it would result in a product that \"would bear little, if any, resemblance to windows 98.\"a justice department spokesman said: \"our response will be filed promptly.\""
