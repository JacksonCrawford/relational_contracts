    "text": "tokyo -- after softbank also said it would change company rules so it could buy back its own shares to make them more attractive.softbank's group net profit totalled 10.3 billion yen (us$78 million) in the year ended 31 march, up 13 percent from the previous year.in addition to its core software business, softbank is also a partner with rupert murdoch in a satellite television service in japan and is a major internet service provider. it has also aggressively acquired firms abroad.son remained confident about the firm's financial situation, which he said should be helped by last week's successful ipo of ziff-davis, in which softbank holds a majority stake. he said that softbank, which has pursued an expansion-through-acquisition policy, had obtained a 152.4 billion yen ($1.1 billion) infusion from the listing, and that the company was deciding how to use the money. he said redemption of some corporate bonds was an option.softbank, saddled with hefty debt, has been dogged by rumors about its weak financial health. investors have also been worried about its profitability and complicated management structure, particularly the functions of mac. son said last december's decision to merge mac would lead to \"complete separation\" of mac from the group, because mac will be liquidated in the aftermath.mac took over unprofitable divisions from firms acquired by softbank, such as ziff-davis's internet information company, zdnet. mac also manages currency risks to help protect softbank from possible losses when it acquires foreign companies.the listing of ziff-davis allowed the us unit to repurchase most of its former operations held by mac, including zdnet, for $270 million in may, following a similar purchase of $100 million worth of former operations in october last year, softbank said. the move will in turn help mac repay its debts, it said.softbank said it would also change company rules to allow it to buy back up to 10 million of its own shares -- worth 60 billion yen ($454 million) -- amounting to 9.7 percent of its outstanding shares. the planned buy-back is subject to shareholders' approval at a meeting on 19 june."
