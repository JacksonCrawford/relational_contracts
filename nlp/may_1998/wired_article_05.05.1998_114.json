    "text": "the borders group, however, despite the launch teaser, borders would not comment further on borders is slightly late in the online book-hawking game, and will face significant competition from online bookselling behemoth \"borders has stumbled heavily in terms of entering into the market,\" said vernon keenan, analyst at zona research. \"there have been indications [that] it has aborted [online] projects in the past. this will be a real trial ... to see if what amazon is doing really gets in borders' face.\" indeed, borders was due to launch last january, and signed a cross-promotional deal with online publisher cnet back in november. borders also has deals with search engine amazon.com, with us$147.8 million in sales in 1997, has made life tough for barnes &#38 noble online, since it had the first-to-market advantage and has developed a strong, worldwide brand, especially with amazon's recent representatives from amazon were nonplussed. \"the book market worldwide is an $84 to 85 billion market,\" said beth garson, amazon spokeswoman. \"there is certainly plenty of room for more than one success story on the internet.\"barnes &#38 noble were similarly optimistic. \"we have been in the bookselling business for more than 30 years,\" said ben boyd, b&#38n spokesman. \"competition creates a win-win situation for the customer. barnesandnoble.com was the first to bring deep discounts and author chats to the internet. we are very comfortable with [our] entry into that category.\"\"what's at stake here is the global market,\" said keenan. \"amazon is a global brand. that's why it has such a high valuation, and why borders is barely able to keep its valuation at sales level. it is a low-margin business confined geographically.\"but keenan said that there's still hope for late entries. \"borders is fumbling, but it still has a chance to pick up. it's one of the great questions of 1998: how well existing brick-and-mortar bookstores can move into this entertainment media web site space.\""
