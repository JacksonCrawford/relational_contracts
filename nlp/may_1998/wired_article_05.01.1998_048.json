    "text": "on the heels hewlett-packard's palmtop is a lot bigger than first-generation hpcs - with a larger color screen and a wider keyboard. the result is a more substantial (read: heavier) feel, which means you should think twice if you're looking for something that fits in your coat pocket.all ce devices feature the same basic software - windows ce 2.0 and a pocket version of microsoft office containing small-screen versions of word, excel, powerpoint, and outlook, as well as the pocket internet explorer. powerpoint and outlook are new in ce 2.0, and, as you would expect, are slimmed-down versions of their desktop counterparts.the \"killer app\" for the 620lx is clearly powerpoint presentations. featuring a very crisp color display and an optional vga-out pc card, this device is a must for those who need to make presentations at a variety of locations and on short notice. anyone who's had to suffer through forced small talk while waiting for their laptop to boot will appreciate the instant start-up. it does have limitations, however: pocket powerpoint can be used only to play back presentations, and its editing capabilities are limited to reordering the slides.absent is the built-in modem present in phillips's and sharp's hpc offerings, but most owners of this model will probably install a fast-card modem in the device's pcmcia slot.at us$899 a pop, the 620lx is at the high end of the hpc market. if you need the color display, or you just want the cadillac of hpcs and don't mind the larger size, this is the model of choice. street cred <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=3\">phone talk</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=4\">on priests of nature</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=5\">rings of truth</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=6\">videogame history 101</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=7\">sorceress of software</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=8\">the return of camp</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=9\">echoes of a community</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=10\">affirmations barbie</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=11\">wormbo</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=12\">online interpreter</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=13\">economics 1, humanity 0</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=14\">maximize the medium</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=15\">readme</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=16\">not all sex is bad sex</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=17\">driving creative business</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=18\">colors for your pad</a><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/6.05/streetcred.html?pg=19\">contributors</a>"
