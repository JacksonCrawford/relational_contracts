    "text": "residents in tennessee at the hambrecht & quist conference on wednesday, the alameda, california-based wink has lurked on the fringes since 1993, being featured in lately, much of the focus in interactive tv has been the fuss over cablelabs' but wink already provides interactivity -- albeit limited -- on about 100,000 televisions in japan, and is currently testing the service via set-top boxes in undisclosed locations in the united states, according to wink's marketing manager barak kassar.toshiba, one of the japanese tv-makers shipping a wink-enabled product, said it will make three of its 98 us models wink-enabled, but refused to elaborate further until an announcement is made next week. kassar said that toshiba will ship 50,000 to 100,000 wink-enabled sets by the end of the year, and that wink is working to sign on more tv-makers.wink employs vertical blanking interval (vbi) technology to transmit data down the unused portion of the analog broadcast channel. its 128-kbyte software program provides a very basic interactive service: if users click on the icon on their screen, another window pops up with additional pre-programmed information about the show. this could include additional sports scores and stats, more data about the current news story on rwanda, or a chance to get a coupon for pop tarts during its commercial. since wink software already resides in several million set-top boxes, according to kassar, all the cable operators have to do is \"flip a switch\" to turn on wink.the company's strategy is highly focused on this \"first-to-market advantage,\" because wink uses existing technology and hardware to deploy its services. \"it's a way for the networks to add value without adding bandwidth,\" said kassar.\"our strategy is that by the time those [advanced set-top boxes] become a reality, we will be one of the checklist items you have to have [inside],\" said wilderotter, during the conference.kassar claims that wink technology will still work with the next-generation boxes and would support additional interactivity. william schleyer, a board member of opencable, joined wink's board of directors on 18 march, which hasn't hurt the firm's prospects. and it helps that both general instruments and scientific-atlanta own a piece of wink, which is working with the two companies to try to ensure it is included in the guts of future set-top boxes. kassar said wink will demo in both companies' booths at next week's cable 98, the national cable television association's (ncta) conference in atlanta.\"are we an interim technology? that's just not true,\" said kassar. \"we are building a strong beachhead; we are building viewer loyalty and brand.\"but most analysts are unwilling to predict so far into the future. \"these piecemeal interim solutions are valuable,\" said gerry kaufold of in-stat. \"there is a big enough market that they can make money in it. today there are 40 or 50 million set-top boxes that wink could potentially go into. even if wink is seen as an interim step, it's a pretty good product life -- five to 10, or 15 years.\"kaufold sees wink's success as broadcaster-dependent. \"all these things represent over the next five years is a cost [to broadcasters],\" he said. \"they know somewhere along the line is a killer app, so they can't ignore it. but they're not thrilled to spend money, so [deployment] might be a bit slow.\"but kassar said that all of wink's broadcasting partners, which include the weather channel, nbc, cnn, nickelodeon, espn, mtv, and vh-1, will launch around 750 hours of enhanced programming a week for top-slotted shows when the deployment begins in tennessee and virginia. the company's heavy-hitting hardware partners include charter communications, tci, sony, jvc, matsushita, and nokia.analysts are likely to say that access to the large tv audience is worth whatever expenses wink might incur. \"somewhere around 10 million households every thursday night at 10 watch but analysts said it is unclear whether americans have any desire for interactive television. \"how much of an advantage is that [first deployment] really?\" said van baker, analyst at dataquest. \"it's not like the consumer is jumping up and down right now saying, 'we want interactivity.'\"but wilderotter claimed that 80 percent of us households want interactivity.and wink will be free to the customer, according to kassar, who said that both the cable operator and the broadcaster will be wink's customers. wink will also get a cut of any transactions.the data gathered from such broadcasts can be valuable as well. \"we know how long they watch a show, and we can provide that data to broadcasters, advertisers, and cable operators,\" said wilderotter.but wink will not be the only player in the market. kaufold cited worldgate, ibm's logicast, microsoft's wavetop program, and even webtv as potential competition in the sooner-vs.-later market.\"wink, along with five or six other companies, is probably going to be successful.... these are small companies. if they can hit their revenue requirements, they are in business,\" said kaufold. \"wink also has customers in japan, so now they have cash flow and can grow.\"the only thing for certain is that, as usual, the customer will be king. \"[wink] will begin to deploy these things, see what reaction is, and begin to understand what will sell and what will not sell,\" said bill zinsmeister, an analyst with international data corp. \"the consumer will decide.\""
