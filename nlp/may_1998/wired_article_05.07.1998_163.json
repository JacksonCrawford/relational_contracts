    "text": "the front door yet ever since 9 april, when k-tel announced that it was going online -- presumably in competition with the likes of subsequent announcements by the company have included partnerships with billboard to host its music and video charts on the k-tel site, and realnetworks for consulting in its forthcoming custom-cd service, as well as a two-for-one stock split. yesterday, k-tel announced that the grtv infomercial network will show k-tel infomercials plugging its wares and its web site, and broadcast k-tel music for one half-hour a day.but besides 250,000 titles for sale, the only things k-tel has to really separate it from the pack are its infamous compilations and a project to sell customized cds from a library of 3,500 tunes, beginning in july. the question is: will custom cds be enough to float the boat?monday's earnings report managed to slow the k-tel k-tel, which launched its online music service on 1 may, reported a net loss of us$952,000, or 12 cents per share, for the third quarter, ended 31 march. the results reflected a two-for-one stock split and compared to a profit of $510,000, or 6 cents per share, a year ago.sales dropped $2.1 million to $16.4 million.k-tel spokespeople refused to talk to wired news, but in a statement, k-tel's president, david weiner said: \"although our initial results are encouraging, the success of online marketing cannot be currently determined, and to achieve further participation in this market will require substantial additional financial resources, development and acquisition of technology, investments in marketing, and contractual relationships with third parties.\"the release also mentioned the custom-cd project.\"k-tel is a little bit like egghead software -- a company with problems in its core business, trying to reinvent itself as a different company,\" said christopher feiss, analyst at alex brown. \"and they are trying to tackle the very real problem of getting mindshare in the net. k-tel has been effectively blocked from larger sites like yahoo by these other guys,\" he said, referring to the slew of exclusive partnerships that online music resellers have been locking down with net hubsites.several other analysts and industry sources said the stock's rise was more the result of an internet sector buying fad than the merits of k-tel itself.but others think that k-tel's offline brand recognition could carry it online. \"i think this means that cdnow is in even more trouble,\" said michael sullivan-trainor, analyst at idc research. \"they are hard pressed to keep their technology and marketing abreast of these new competitors.\"online music seller n2k's president and ceo jim coane seemed to think that k-tel was not a direct competitor. \"clearly what they're doing and what we're doing is very different today.\"but coane did admit that n2k is working on a custom-cd project of its own. \"it will probably be a combination of in-house [technology] and outsourcing. to allow consumers to select tracks, custom-produce a cd, get into a package with cover art, and ship to [a] customer, all the things that have to happen are not easy to do. if it was easy to do it would be available. companies focusing on that niche are only starting to emerge.\"\"is it feasible and mechanically practical? yes,\" said feiss. \"can you do it [in] volume? that's tricky, unless there is a long delay between order and delivery.\"and custom cds are pricey to produce, according to some. \"if you go for the huge-catalog and oldies mass market, which others are doing, you are going to encounter high inventory costs. you are paying for storage space for all these song files,\" said alan manuel, co-founder of several other smaller companies have launched custom-cd sites, including custom revolutions and music connection. some, like custom revolutions, have developed the technology in-house and are offering the custom-cd service to other web sites and labels.aside from the technical logistics involved in custom cds, legal issues abound.\"one word: royalties,\" said paris burstyn, analyst at international data corp., in an email. \"when an album is purchased, those rights have been negotiated and allocated in advance. but what about individual tracks? going forward, those rights may be negotiated with new artists.... it gets very complex to negotiate the rights to produce custom cds. tower records attempted to put kiosks in its stores, but ran afoul of these issues and had to stop its test.\"and until more modern hits become available for recording, it might be hard to be original. \"we think a lot of people will be competing for the oldies-type things,\" said manuel. \"that will be a hard fight to win, because if you have more than one vendor with access to the same catalog, you will have competition with people delivering the same exact product.\"feiss agreed. \"tell me what precludes cdnow from offering the same thing,\" he said. \"k-tel is well-regarded, it's known, but how many people who are music aficionados would feature k-tel at the front of their music rack, and say, 'check it out, i got the brand new k-tel album?'\"\"custom compilations won't sell if people can't get access to major artists -- the well known tracks,\" said n2k's coane. \"it's going to be some time before labels are gonna give that up. a whole new economic model will have to work for highly valued tracks to be available in that kind of format.\""
