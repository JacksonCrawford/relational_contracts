    "text": "monterey, california - tuesday's session, presented in a q&a game format, often drifted into the arcane technical, legal, and procedural details of taking a company public. but it also hit on some of the distinguishing characteristics of the current high-tech investment market.three teams made up of investment bankers and executives from the conference's cast of high-tech start-ups grappled their way through questions about things like us securities and exchange commission law and board of directors and management issues.category, \"ipo bean counter issues,\" for 400: \"what is cheap stock?\"answer: all options, warrants, and shares issued by a company, within the 12-month period prior to the filing of the registration, at a price less than the ipo price.category, \"ipo legal beagle issues,\" for 200: \"what is the mechanism that the company and the underwriters use to bring the ipo [initial public offering] price of the company's stock to a price that is attractive to the investors?\"answer: a stock split or reverse stock split.but perhaps the most salient tidbit came last. the final question was \"what record year did nasdaq list the greatest number of ipos?\" the answer, of course, was 1996. since then, the market has grown decidedly cooler.in 1996, there were 132 ipos in the united states, according to the san francisco-based research firm ventureone. in 1997, that number dropped to 104. in the first quarter of 1998, there were only 21 ipos. in each period, roughly half of the ipos were high-tech companies, according to ventureone.yet though the ipo market may be cooling, by all accounts the cash is flowing here at venture market west. for some, the recently roaring bull market for internet-related companies has created a windfall of investor interest.flycast communications, which provides the software infrastructure to connect buyers and sellers of online advertising, has been reaping the benefits of the recent success of market leader doubleclick, which has seen its market capitalization soar to us$650 million in the wake of its late february ipo.\"people are looking to give us money because of doubleclick,\" said flycast chief executive miles welsh. the irony is flycast has not been actively seeking a new round of venture financing; investors have just been knocking on the door, walsh said.flycast was planning to look for a second round of financing of $15 million to $20 million later this year (the company was started on seed investment of $1.1 million in the summer of 1996). but now that a number of institutional investors have come a-callin', walsh said the company is \"wrestling with what to do.\" since flycast is earning revenues (walsh said it is on track to pull in $10 million this year), and valuation is tied to revenues, there is incentive to hold off on the financing and let the company's valuation grow.\"we've got a little breathing room,\" walsh said. that means there is time to wait for an investor that will be the best partner for the company.another internet ad man haunting the halls of the monterey plaza hotel was adauction.com founder and chief executive david wamsley, whose company is smaller and in need of faster cash, but less of it. he too was upbeat about the supply of cash on the market.wamsley said institutional investors and venture capitalists move too slowly, sometimes taking two and a half months to complete a deal. but for some small companies \"there's a need for speed,\" he said. and floating in every crowd, waiting to grant a wish, is an angel investor with a fat checkbook.\"there are so many guys with so much cash that a 20-minute talk in the corner amounts to the sum total of the due diligence,\" wamsley said. in the case of the two-day conference, he said he expects to raise $500,000 from four or five angels.the slow ipo market has little effect on the flow of cash to early stage companies, because the little guys are often three or four years away from thinking seriously about going public, according to steve jurvetson, managing director of the investment firm draper fisher jurvetson. \"we can't let current windows [of opportunity for ipos] affect our investment decisions,\" jurvetson said.and, of course, slow times for ipos doesn't mean a brick wall at the end of the road for start-up companies. there are other options.category, \"legal beagles,\" for 300: \"name three types of acquisitions.\"answer: mergers, stock purchases (or tender offers), and purchases of assets.jurvetson said more and more companies are looking at being bought out as an attractive option. \"but we advise our portfolio companies to take the ipo route,\" jurvetson said.that's still the road that leads to the real promised land.in a keynote address on the first day of the conference, daniel case, chairman and chief executive of hambrecht & quist, pointed to a graph showing the cash volume of us ipos by quarter.in the first quarter of 1998, ipo volume amounted to something in the neighborhood of $4 billion. the second quarter is looking even better. from 1-24 april alone, the ipo volume had already reached $1 billion, case said. well over 90 percent of the companies were priced at or above their expected valuation."
