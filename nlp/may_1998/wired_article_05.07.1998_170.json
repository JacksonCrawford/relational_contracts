    "text": "a federal judge the suit alleged that netscape had violated patents held by wang relating to functions in its early-1980s \"videotex\" system that are now widely implemented in browsers, including the \"save as\" function that allows people to save text from a web page, and the bookmarks function. wang claimed that the concept extended beyond its proprietary system and into web pages and web browsers.netscape attorneys argued that there was no need for a trial because the functions were widely implemented and, under the applicable law, the patent was not infringed.the courts agreed. judge leonie brinkema, of the district judge for the eastern district of virginia, ruled that wang's patent on the videotex system was \"generically and fundamentally different\" from internet web browsers. brinkema said that wang's patent did not cover pages displayed on the web, and that videotex was a closed and proprietary system that relied on a central database supplier.attorney david himelstein, who specializes in intellectual property law, agreed with the judge's reasoning. \"it makes good sense,\" himelstein said. \"when you write a patent so many years ago and then expect it to apply to a technology that did not exist at the time, it's a big stretch.\"himelstein suggested the early dismissal indicates that the judge questioned the validity of wang's patent claims and demonstrates the strength of the judge's convictions regarding the weakness of wang's case.the suit only recently \"the response we received from internet developers was overwhelmingly positive and represented high quality, detailed and well-researched documentation that contributed to our case,\" said netscape counsel roberta katz in a statement.an announcement of the victory on the \"you guys blew away our lawyers,\" said a member of netscape's mozilla team. \"tons of stuff came in, and good stuff...it's really clear that the net can be an invaluable resource in fighting bogus claims. anything done to reduce abuse of [intellectual property] law has got to be good.\"wang could not be reached for comment."
