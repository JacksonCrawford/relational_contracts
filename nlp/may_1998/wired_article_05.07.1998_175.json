    "text": "the world has german car giant daimler-benz's us$38 billion stock-swap acquisition of the chrysler corp., the third largest american automaker that once championed the \"buy american\" slogan, will reshape the automaking industry and give both companies a larger stake in the global market.the deal was confirmed today by both companies, one day after they announced that merger discussions were under way.the takeover is the largest ever of an american company by a foreign firm, and creates the world's fifth-largest automaker. the combined companies' line of vehicles will range from daimler's luxury mercedes-benz limousines to jeeps, to the neon, chrysler's lowest-cost compact.\"it is a marriage made in heaven,\" said daimler chairman j\u00fcrgen schrempp, who becomes, with chrysler's robert eaton, co-chairman of the new company, daimlerchrysler. the new company will have corporate offices in stuttgart, germany, and the detroit suburb of auburn hills.the merger gives daimler the opportunity to expand into the world's largest auto market beyond its luxury car base. chrysler stands to benefit from daimler's engineering prowess and will gain access to the european market, where it has only a tiny share. but the deal's real value may be that the two companies will now be able to reduce administration costs, share research and development expenses, and secure better component prices, analysts said.indeed, the companies said such sharing will save daimlerchrysler $1.9 billion in 1999 and $3 billion a year within three to five yearsthe deal likely won't mean much to consumers. eaton said the mercedes and chrysler brands, and their dealerships, would remain distinct even within the merged company.\"we believe very strongly that a brand is the most important thing a company owns and i can assure you we will do nothing but to improve those brands and yes, they will clearly be separate brands forever,\" said eaton, who will step down from daimlerchrysler co-leadership in three years.schrempp and eaton said there will be no plant closures or layoffs as a result of the merger. they said the number of workers -- the two companies now employ a total of 421,000 -- is actually likely to grow.top officials from the united auto workers union said the merger raises numerous questions -- particularly regarding non-union manufacturing jobs -- but does not appear to weaken the labor organization.\"we made our feelings known that after looking at the situation we felt it could be a win-win situation if certain things happened regarding the uaw and the new corporation,\" said stephen yokich, the uaw's president.at a joint news conference at a london hotel, schrempp and eaton said the deal increases their potential for growth. eaton predicted that the merger is just the beginning as the auto industry continues to become more global.\"we are leading a new trend we believe will change the future, the face of the industry,\" he said.industry watchers said the daimlerchrysler deal was a sign of the times, with too many carmakers fighting for too few sales, making rationalization key to survival on lower margins.\"it comes down to economies of scale,\" said garel rhys, director for automotive industry research at the cardiff business school.the creation of such a vast transatlantic conglomerate touches on sensitive national -- as well as economic -- issues.the three-pointed mercedes-benz star, prominently displayed throughout germany, has become an enduring symbol of the country's economic success.similarly, chrysler has found its echo in american architecture with new york city's chrysler building. the skyscraper, set with steel gargoyles and bearing founder walter p. chrysler's first set of tools encased beneath the spire, is a monument to us industrial vitality.ironically, however, the building's signature chrome steel spire was cast in germany, by krupp, in the 1920s.\"on the road to world inc.\" \"this bridge over the atlantic between stuttgart and michigan would be unsurpassed in corporate architecture,\" the frankfurt-based the to underline what could be a rush to consolidate huge overcapacity in the sector, the owners of a much smaller luxury-car maker, britain's rolls-royce, stunned the market with news that german mass producer volkswagen had outbid its rival bmw in a race to buy the firm.reuters contributed to this report."
