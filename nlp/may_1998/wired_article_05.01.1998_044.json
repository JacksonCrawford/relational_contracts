    "text": "__ just outta __ the paperless doctor's office __the prescription for the overburdened health-care system could very well be the paperless claims process developed by realmed. the company plans to sidestep the mountains of paperwork by giving smartcards to patients, installing software at doctors' offices, and operating a private network - in effect creating a common digital platform for patients, practitioners, and insurers. it works like this: the patient presents the smartcard to the doctor, the realmed system verifies patient insurance eligibility, and data is automatically sent to the payment center, which then authorizes a transfer of funds.recently, attempts to revamp the claims system have focused on electronic data interchange. unfortunately, edi treats the symptoms, not the illness: it demands that claims be filled out by hand, entered into a computer and transmitted electronically, and then converted back to paper for payment. with realmed, the entire rigmarole is electronic. apart from substantial savings, the system can shave the time it takes to receive a reimbursement from 42 days to about 5 minutes. now that's a health-care initiative.__ chat attack ____ mini memory ____ meta-physicist ____ binding email ____ convergence comeback __this is the conundrum faced by simplytv, which on april 5 began transmitting 1,000 full-length televisual shows over the net. viewers who log on have had to make do with realvideo, which streams images at about half the frame rate of broadcast television, and a 3-by-4-inch picture.hoping to get past the bandwidth obstacles, simplytv has cut a deal with satellite tv provider echostar communications. the two companies will broadcast simplytv's current fare, which includes content from time warner and cnn, plus live concerts, boxing matches, and comedy shows from echostar's satellites directly to your pc.but simplytv hasn't foresaken the net entirely. during satellite programming breaks, advertisements are transmitted over the internet. and these interstitial ads - streaming video spots that have more in common with 30-second tv pitches than the web's banner offerings - are targeted to individual web viewers, allowing for immediate impulse buying. indeed, the combination of popular programming and targeted advertising should assure that simplytv doesn't strike out."
