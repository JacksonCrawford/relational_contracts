    "text": "it's the top seat-side computer-televisions that debuted at the super bowl in january will become commonplace at sports stadiums in the near future, industry executives say.the \"choiceseats\" computers demonstrated at the super bowl in san diego used touch-activated screens that allowed fans to see instant replays, view plays from different angles, call up player statistics, and order team-related merchandise from their seats during the game. as the computers become more sophisticated, can emailing the manager or coach be far behind?\"it's the next widget,\" said barry goldberg, general manager of choiceseats, maker of the interactive screens, to a bond buyer stadium and arena conference this week.based on the response the company got from the super bowl, he predicted all national football league stadiums would have similar devices within five years. at least one baseball stadium, banc one ballpark in phoenix, is already using them. (but not in the cheap seats.)not surprisingly, stadium and arena managers are looking at interactive technology as a new revenue source, industry executives said.goldberg said his company could guarantee approximately us$20 of revenue per game per occupied seat with its screens. the money is derived mainly from on-screen advertising, which would have to be carefully contracted to avoid conflicts with stadium naming rights and sponsorship deals.another company, north communications, is demonstrating its interactive kiosks at the new mci center arena in washington, dc. fans can call up team statistics, send email to players, play video sports games, and buy game tickets via credit card.michael conniff, chairman of interactive sports, which provides sports news and programming for outlets such as north's kiosks, predicts stadium owners will soon begin to sell interactive rights in the same way they now sell naming rights and concession rights.some revenue from these agreements will come from sales transactions conducted online. the rest would come from selling retailers information about sports' fans buying habits, he said.north's general manager, adam parker, cautioned that installing the new technology requires that stadiums be \"wired from a to z,\" an advantage the mci center already had as part of the telecommunications company's sponsorship.dividing the revenues from such technology also could complicate existing lease agreements between teams and sports authorities, others cautioned.the maryland stadium authority's lease with the baltimore orioles was drafted 10 years ago, when cable television was a relatively new medium. it made no provision for advertising signage that now appears on television screens but not on the actual stadium, the authority's general counsel said.\"it's difficult to anticipate technology changing so quickly,\" she said."
