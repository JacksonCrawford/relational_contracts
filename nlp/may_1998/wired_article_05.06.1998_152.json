    "text": "european union merger the source told reuters that the panel from 15 european nations made its recommendation despite monday's offer from kirch and bertelsmann to sell 25 percent of a kirch subsidiary, which controls key digital set-top decoder technology.the european commission, the eu's clearinghouse for large mergers and acquisitions, refused to comment on the meeting of the advisory committee. clt-ufa, the joint tv venture between bertelsmann and audiofina, confirmed that the companies had made more concessions on monday, but declined to elaborate.rival companies, which include public german broadcasters and private cable operators, fear an agreement between the two media giants would kill efforts by others to launch digital tv platforms.last week, kirch, which owns a vast arsenal of films and sports broadcasting rights, offered to sell 25 percent of output rights to hollywood films, a key ingredient for successful pay-tv, and to license the manufacturing of betaresearch's digital set-top decoders.but european commission sources said this was not enough.the advisers' recommendations are not legally binding, but are usually followed by the european commission. the commission has until 3 june to make a final decision. controversial mergers are often settled in 11th-hour talks."
