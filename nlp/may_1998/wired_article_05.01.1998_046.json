    "text": " edward ayers isn't  just bringing the civil war to the web his online archive is changing history.  __ edward l. ayers is still fighting the civil war. for the last seven years, the university of virginia historian and his team of grad students have been creating the valley of the shadow, an \"intentional archive\" on the web (__wired: why change the way we think about the civil war?ayers: we have contradictory notions about the conflict that we carry around in our heads. we know that it was a horrible time, a brothers' war of massive death and destruction. but we also have the other story, that we went through this ordeal to emerge a better people, that it was a crucible of american greatness. that's the part i have trouble with.this sounds like the same \"narrative illusion of a seamless story\" you tried to shatter in your 1992 book even a historian can be hostage to the way we've learned about the war. we have in our minds these currier & ives prints. of course, battlefields aren't \"battlefields\" - they're a railroad cut, or a wheat field. or somebody's yard. it's made me understand how deeply the war penetrated every single part of society. everything's connected to everything else.the past has been increasingly popularized by television, the old \"new way\" of doing history. how has tv shaped our thinking?each medium, even each way you tell a story, forecloses certain opportunities. ironically, people think of television as a step toward digital information, but in terms of narrative it may be even more linear than print. with a television screen, you feel the need to tell a story. a story necessarily starts somewhere and goes somewhere else. you can't stop it, you can't branch off of it, you can only go where it leads. in so there's no narrative to the valley?there is a story: the war comes and sweeps all these people up into it. but you can also make your own story through the process of triangulation - comparing fragments from a diary to an article in the newspaper and then connecting that to the census. while, alone, those might just be inert information, combining them somehow electrifies all three. and it may be a story that you are the very first person to have seen.what have you personally discovered?people on the project kid me for loving the three-dimensional maps, but that comes closest to what i envisioned from the beginning: kind of like the holodeck on more information and more access certainly \"democratizes\" history. but isn't something lost when you can rewrite the past with a click of the mouse?life is short. people are curious about the past, but there's a finite amount of time they'll spend living in the past unless they have a passion for it, like i do. in even if it means strengthening the voice of, say, the kkk?what makes history different from other disciplines is the almost superstitious belief in evidence. i have faith that the historical record is capacious enough that no single argument, of whatever sort, can withstand the weight of overwhelming evidence.has the digital revolution accelerated this process?the greatest obstacle new media faces is its own hyperbole. as a historian, no matter how postmodern i might be, i don't throw around words like \"revolution.\" a railroad is a revolution. is this a new railroad? is this just tv on steroids? we don't know yet. we're in the crystal radio stage of this technology, the kinescope.so what's the future of history?think about what an old typewritten letter looks like to us now. email, though it now seems transparent, will look ridiculously antiquated at some point. historians will find our handprints all over this stuff. they'll see humanity struggling to use new tools in what may seem a crude and affecting way. that's one of the things historians discover: we're always in history, but people at the time never recognize it."
