            <h1>Relational Contracts Data Visualization</h1>
                <p>This project was conceived by Dr. Jesse Anttila-Hughes and Dr. Antara Haldar, from the University of San Francisco and University of Cambridge, respectively, and is meant to investigate the evolution of Silicon Valley and the technology industry over time, based on textual data gathered from the WIRED magazine archives. The data to be represented here will be the results of the Natural Language Processing that we have started doing.</p>
